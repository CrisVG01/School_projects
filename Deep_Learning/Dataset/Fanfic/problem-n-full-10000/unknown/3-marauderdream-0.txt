looked completely appalled. "Guys, I really don't think he'd appreciate us talking about him like this." "It's not like we're saying anything negative. Everyone in the camp supports their relationship," Leo said. "I think the other Apollo kids were going to hold their own intervention if Will didn't make a move soon." Piper smiled. "They do make a really cute couple." "If they're a couple, that is," Percy corrected. "We don't know for sure." Meanwhile, Hazel just listened in silence, smiling to herself. If only they'd heard Nico chattering all last night about it, unable to sleep until early that morning because he was too excited to shut up about how happy he was. "Do Neville and Luna end up together?" "I thought I said no spoilers, Nico. Aim higher." The boys were practicing archery in the arena. Nico's technique hadn't improved much since he'd first started training, considering he'd been spending all of his free time immersed in the Wizarding World. He launched the arrow sloppily, missing the target by a mile. "Come on, just this one spoiler," he begged. "Neville deserves some happiness." "Fine," Will sighed, guiding Nico's arms to the correct position. "They're not together in the books, but it's implied in the movies. That's all I'm telling you." "That's not fair at all!" Nico flailed and fired another arrow, almost impaling an Ares kid twenty feet away. "At least tell me Ron breaks up with that Lavender girl. He and Hermione are meant to be together." "If it's meant to be, it'll happen," said Will. "I need to go do cabin inspection. Please try to concentrate on your technique." He made sure no one was paying attention to them before giving him a quick kiss goodbye. Wouldn't want to give Drew and the other Aphrodite kids the satisfaction of cheating Piper out of another twenty bucks. "See you at dinner." He should know better than to do that. There was no way Nico could concentrate when his brain went all fuzzy like that every time Will kissed him. "No, you see, Bellatrix is Sirius' cousin. The whole Black family tree is very complicated. I can find it somewhere and show you." Hazel felt like she was about to pull her hair out. Nico had just finished the sixth and penultimate book in the Harry Potter series and, as usual, could not shut up about it. These days it was like he couldn't wipe the smile off his face, and Hazel was eternally grateful for that. "Nico, I love you, and I admire your appreciation for fictional family trees," she explained, "but I really need to go. I promised Frank I'd meet up with him more than fifteen minutes ago." His smile faltered slightly. "Oh. Right. Sure thing. You'll be back for dinner, right?" "Of course," she said, ducking out of Hades cabin as fast as she could. Nico knew she probably couldn't be more disinterested in Sirius Black's colorful family history, but he needed someone to talk to about it. He knew he was in too deep. He felt like if he didn't say anything about it to someone at least once a day he could explode. Will was busy with head counselor duties, so there was no one else he could really talk to. No better time to start Deathly Hallows, then. (Sent 2:49 AM) DUMBLEDORE KNEW ALL ALONG? WHAT THE HELL? SNAPE WAS IN LOVE WITH HARRY'S MOM Oh my gods. Oh. My. Gods. OH MY GODS WILL.

(Sent 3:16 AM) ...So I see you read The Prince's Tale. Welcome to the heart wrenching world of fiction. We begin marathoning the movies tomorrow. I shall prepare the snacks and blanket fort. Noon, Apollo cabin. Be prepared. All was well. "Wait..." Nico re-read the final sentence exactly twelve times before speaking up. "That's it?" "That's it," Will smiled. "It can't be," Nico closed the book and stared at the orange cover. There, right in the center, stood The Boy Who Lived. And Nico held the last of Harry's adventures in his hands. "There's got to be more. What happens with Teddy and Victoire? What house does Albus Severus get sorted into? There's so much more to know, she can't just end it there ." "But she can. And she did. Now get over here, Sorcerer's Stone is starting." Nico grudgingly obliged, curling into Will's arm as the Warner Brothers logo came up on the screen. "If you think this is frustrating, just wait until I introduce you to Star Trek and Doctor Who." "Will Solace don't you dare break my heart with more fictional character deaths. I'm going to need at least a two week mourning period for Fred Weasley." "Look at it this way," Will whispered, "in the end, despite all the pain and suffering, everything in Harry's life was okay. In the end, he was happy." "That's all I could ask for," Nico replied. The sleep deprivation must have finally caught up to Nico, since he didn't even make it to Harry and Ron meeting on the Hogwarts Express before he was fast asleep on Will's shoulder. Will pulled him closer, kissing his forehead. As long as he's happy, Will thought. That's all I can ask for.
