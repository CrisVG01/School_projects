up. "Look, Paul is sorry. Why don't you just talk-" He said, but Leah cut him off. "Mind your own business, Samantha. " She snapped. "Eve! I'm sorry! I just, just.." He trailed off. I pretended to whip a tear away. "Boo hoo, poor little Paul. His imprint doesn't want him anymore." I mocked him, before I realized what I just said. I clamped a hand over my mouth. Leah stood up and helped me up. "Move it Eve!" She said, and we made a run for it. "EVE!" I heard Jake, Sam and Paul yell. "Shit! Double shit! They'll know Le-Le." I said. "C'mon, we'll phase, it'll be quicker, they won't notice it's us.. I think." She said as we ran into the woods. We phased and ran to the house. When we arrived at the house the boys were already there, they saw us in our wolf form. I growled. Jake looked me straight in my eyes and his eyes widened. "EVE?!" He exclaimed, shocked. Oh, oh. Let's just phase. I thought to Leah. We walked in the woods and phased. Leah hugged me. "It's going to be alright, Eve. Forgive him." She said. I shrugged and took her hand, as we walked back. "So, I guess you figured it out." I said. Their eyes widened. "Why didn't you tell us?!" Jake demanded. "Pssj, why would I tell you that? I was way too scared to be abandoned." I said. "Eve?" Jake said softly. "What?" I looked sharply at him. "When did you phase?" He said. "When I heard Opa talk about mom, he was saying she shouldn't have abandoned me. I understand why, though." I said. "Did you imprint." Paul said. I looked at him. "Yeah." I said softly and quickly looked away. Leah squeezed my hand. "When?" He said. "The first time, in the grocery store." I said. His eyes widened. "But that means- I broke up- when you..?" He stuttered. "Yeah." I said, I felt tears in my eyes. Leah tugged at my hand. "Look, we won't bother you. You can just patrol whenever you want. You won't see us." She said as the tugged me away. "EVE! I'm sorry! I love you!" I heard Paul yell. I froze. "D-Don't do this Paul." I said, with my back still towards him. "Why?! You know we're soul mates! I won't leave you ever again." He said. I felt a tear stream down my cheek. "Yeah, but it won't be by choice right? You won't be with because you want to. But because the imprint makes you want that. I don't want to be in that kind of relationship." I said. I turned my head to look at him. "I only broke up because I was scared! Everything was going so fast! I had never been in a relationship before!" He said. "Well you shouldn't have broken up with be like that! Were you only thinking of yourself?! Did you know what it did to me?! Your imprint telling you he doesn't want you anymore because he want other girls?!" I yelled, fully sobbing now. "Why didn't you tell me anyway?" He said. "I was going to tell you." I said, softly. "When? After a year? After we were married?" He said. "No! I was going to tell you the day you broke up with me!" I said. I tugged at Leah's hand and ran away. - I collapsed on my bed and sobbed. Leah stroked my head and shushed me. Everybody may think she's a big bitch, but inside she's a softly. "It's alright, Eve." She said. She kept stroking my head until I fell asleep. - I woke up with a body pressed up behind me. "W-Wha." I asked, groggily and confused. I looked behind me and saw Paul, he was asleep. I felt a dopy smile spreading over my face. Then I remembered. "Paul!" I yelled, he woke up. "W-what?" He said, groggily. "Mind explaining what you are doing in my bed?!" I demanded. "Eve, I'm sorry. I just- I just miss you." He said, as he pressed his face in my hair. "I love you Eve, I know I did wrong. I was just scared!" He sobbed. I froze, was he crying? "Eve, please forgive me. I-I love you." He said softly, I felt tears on my back. I turned around and looked at him. His cheeks were red, his eyes were bloodshot and his cheeks were wet with tears. "Oh, Paul." I sighed and buried my head in his neck, breathing him in. I forgot how I missed his woodsy smell. "Paul, I missed you." I said as I pressed my lips to his neck. His warms curled around my waist and tightened. "Eve.." He breathed. "I love you, Paul. I'm so sorry." I said. I felt tears prickle behind my eyes. "Eve just shut up and kiss me." He laughed. I turned my head and pressed my lips to his. I felt his tongue slide over my lips, asking for entrance. I opened my lips and met his tongue, we fought for dominance for a couple of minutes before Leah burst in and we had to break apart. (Lol, I feel like such a pervert right now, God, how prudish am I XD) "PAUL! Oh.. Am I interrupting something?" She smirked. "Yes!" I exclaimed. "Now shoo!" I said. "I'm not a do-" She said but I cut her off. "Oh yes you are." I smirked. She growled and walked away. Though I saw her smiling when she closed the door. "What did you do to her?" I smirked. "Nothing. I just tied her to a chair. She wouldn't let me in." He pouted. I burst out in laughing. "I love you." He smiled softly at me. I kissed him softly on the lips. "I love you too, my imprint." I said, smiling, knowing our future together would be good. YAYY I'm finally finished, this one took me forever. Please, review :D?
