on I am Percy Jackson I disrespect the gods constantly. "Alright your such a baby sometimes one piece of advice before you go check all of the menus before your start." Once again Grim disappears in a flash of light. Once again everything fades to black then I see Olympus before the fight with these words in front of it. Percy Jackson the RPG. [Start] Seeing as my only option is start I hit it. This time 4 menus pop up in my vision and this is what they say. [New Game] [Load Game] [Options] [Extras] Sigh I know I am going to regret this but Grim did say to at least check the other menus I hit options to see if anything their will help me. [Difficulty] [In Game Options] [Graphics] [Language] Well they do look promising well the first two look do it I hit difficulty. [Easy] ([Normal]) [Hard] [God-ling] [God-like] [Back] Okay well I am currently on normal at the moment that seems fine as long as I don't encounter anything worse than a titan I should be fine. I hit the back button and go to in game options. [Subtitles] [Off] [On] [Tips] [Off] [On] [Tutorial] [Off] [On] [Mini-Map] [Off] [On] [Pause] [Off] [On] [Back] Why the hell do I have Subtitles you know what screw it I am just going to turn on all of the options on. I hit back and end up at the main menu I might as well check extra no harm in doing it right. [Achievements] [Cheats] [Credits] [Back] I click on achievements I apparently have some already sure enough I see the three achievements I unlocked I click on each to get a description. (Holder of the sky) Oh you can lift nice you know what I can do, I can lift the SKY! Unlocked from holding the sky. + 2 to the strength stat. I already knew that one I should have clicked on the others. (Maze runner) What do you mean I can't run here you say people get lost well I am too smart for that. Unlocked from going into and successfully navigate the Labyrinth. + 2 to the Intelligence stat. Well at least I know where this came from I got this because I got to the center of the Labyrinth. (Romancer) Well who am I to say no to the ladies they are the ones that love me. Unlocked from having two or more main girls like you. + 2 to the Charisma stat. What how the hell did I get that well Calypso did say she loved me but who is the second one. After those three it's just a list of question marks I guess I got to do them first before I can look at them. Well one more left cheats I don't think I want to hit credits for all I know it could be Grim's name over and over on a page. When I hit cheats I expected something but all I got was another list of question marks although this one was way smaller. Well that's that I can finally get back to my life I go back to the main menu and hit new game as soon as my finger leaves the button I get transported into a room with thousands of statues of me only 9 of them have a spot light on them though. As I walk towards the ones with lights I look and the statues surrounding me one stops me as I gape at it. Titan King Percy. All stats start at 8. All skills start at 50. A genius of all combat he was born with all of the abilities of his ancestors the titans. Unlock condition defeat all titans single handily twice. I see the now named titan king Percy wink at me with a smug grin I just move one I go to the ones with lights. So these statues are my avatars I look around for the one that caught my interest earlier. Time Percy All stats start at 4. All skills start at 30. Starts with the Time control tree open. As a baby this Percy was born with the innate ability to control time from his grandfather the titan king Kronos so not only could he control the water the sands of time were his to control. I gape at the statue it's like the titan king Percy but less arrogant well I still would be the same person I might as well chose this one. Everything fades to black once more but I can feel again in fact I feel warm so very warm. That is in till I am pulled from my nice warm surroundings into a place that's so cold. I cry out uncontrollable and open my eyes a soon as I am surround by warm again I can't see much but I think that's my mother how is she holding me. "Well aren't you the cutest baby ever I have just the name for you, you're going to be named Perseus but I will call you Percy." My mother greets me with a warm smile at least I think so I can only make out rough shapes then her words catch up to me. My sea green eyes open wide if you look closely you can see a faint ring of gold around the pupil but no one commented on that no they were distracted by the first baby they ever saw stop crying and just gape. WHAT THE HELL I AM A BABBY. (-) And done well if you read my other story then you know for a fact that I like to end on cliff hangers it's just so much fun. I don't have much to say I would appreciate reviews. And no Annabeth was not looking away in guilt because she did not like Percy the reason was she felt guilty for getting him in the situation but Percy misunderstood.
