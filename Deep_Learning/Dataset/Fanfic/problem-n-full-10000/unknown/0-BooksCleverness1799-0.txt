another agonized scream rang through the house. "AAAHHH... EET BURNZ. HELP ME ALEXANDEER, ZE FLAMES BURN" "MUMMY NO!" "PHILLIP COME BACK!" Another scream. And another scream. And another. Hermione found she could no longer breathe. Her chest constricted so tightly that it hurt . Her breaths were coming in short gasps and she couldn't think and she couldn't think and she couldn't breathe and she couldn't scream and oh god. ok get it together granger. last time the flames- they dont burn you. they dont burn Before she had even gotten to her conclusion, Hermione's legs were pumping, running faster than she had in her life towards the dining room. She wasn't prepared for the sight that greeted her. Green. Green everywhere. Green curtains. Green chairs. Green carpets green bodies oh god green bodies green bodies. green walls green bodies. Silent bodies. Unmoving bodies. Oh god what have i done. The room was eerily quiet. It wasn't the quiet that you would find in a classroom of children taking an exam. It wasn't the quiet of a movie theater as the show starts. Those were comforting- those had the shared warmth of other beings respecting the other. No. This quiet is the type of quiet you find when you're alone. When you don't know what to do; when you're at a loss. When you go into the recesses of your mind, to your deepest fears and thoughts and emotions. It was so quiet it was deafening. It was the quiet of the dead. If a person were to walk into the Granger's dining room, they would hear only the gasping breaths of a young girl who was overwhelmed with sadness and disbelief. That's not what Hermione heard. She didn't notice when her knees clashed painfully with the floor. She didn't notice when her body went limp and her eyes turned blank. She didn't notice when the sight became too much and she managed to walk herself upstairs and into her room. She didn't notice when she fell once again to the floor. She didn't notice the ring of green that circled her body, nor the yell of the neighbors as they saw the burning house. And she most definitely didn't hear the sirens of the ambulance, nor the telltale pops of Aurors arriving to the scene. She could only hear them. Hear their agonized screams and pleading yells for mercy as the flames burned them to death. Oh god what have i done 'WHAT DID YOU DO' "MUMMY" "ZE FLAMES BURN' "PHILLIP COME BACK" "SORRY CAN'T FIX THIS" "MADAME GRANGER!' im so so sorry i didnt mean for this to happen im so sorry the air. its too smoke. too much. too much its too much. flesh. is that burning flesh. burning flesh. green bodies. green everything. green eyes green hair green arms and legs and clothes all green. green bodies. unmoving. unseeing green bodies. dead green bodies. i killed them. im sorry im sorry im sorry i didnt want this to happen im sorry. ew. burnt flesh smells bad. my families burnt flesh She rolled over and retched. too heavy. cant see. too warm. too cold. too empty. im sorry. imsorryimsoryyimsorry. i killed you im sorry. watery eyes. it stings. i bet its the smoke. cant breathe cant breathe ant breathe. okok breathe in- no im inhaling too much smoke. cant move. they wont move. im sorry.

"I'm sorry Minerva, but it must be done." The woman in question spluttered in anger and disbelief before hissing at him in her heavy scottish accent. "Albus- surely not! Have you no sense of where to place orphaned children?" The elderly man only chuckled before he began to stroke his beard. 'No... I suppose not." Minerva, however did not find this amusing, and the shade of scarlett she had turned proved so. "This is no time for laughs, Albus! This young girl has just caused her parents death- something that will surely haunt until her dying days, and you wish to send her to,' now she stopped and looked around, as if making sure noone heard her," you wish to send her to you-know-whos' orphanage?!" Now, Dumbledore stopped stroking his long silver beard and sighed. 'Minerva, please, in time you will undestand." No , Albus. I don't think anyone will ever understand you and your cryptic messages.' Minerva thought. Neither Professors were aware of the pair of ears listening intently to their conversation. What orphanage? Who's 'you- know-who'? Why is Albus Dumbdoor crazy? "I suppose I can't stop you from making this decision, Albus. But what can we do?" What will they do? Are they wizards too? Maybe they're trying to read my mind. Well, I won't let them! " There is only one thing left to do, Minerva."
