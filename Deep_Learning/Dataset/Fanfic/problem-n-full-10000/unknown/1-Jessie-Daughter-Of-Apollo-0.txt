I brush it off but obviously it isn't that easy. "Liar!" He says, folding his arms over his chest. I sigh. "Listen Freddie, I was around, just walking around for the day, hung out with a few of my friends from school." I smile at him and ruffle his hair. He giggles, "Okay, I believe you" He mutters. "But don't go off again, Daddy and I was worried." I feel a pang of guilt and I cringe as he says so. I feel so bad about worrying him but I nod again and pinch his cheeks. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Time lapse~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The next day I jump out of bed, walking downstairs to the kettle and boil the water in the kettle. I need a bath to look good for the Capitol. Once I've boiled the bath water I place it in the bath and climb in, groaning as the water over comes my stressed body and the hot water unknotting all the knots and tight spots. I sit in the bath until it gets cold, washing and cleaning myself until I squeak. They only accept the best. I climb out of the bath, pulling a brush through my Honey blonde locks, the gleam as the water drips down them. I pull my hair into a complicated bun, twisting the locks as one or two strands fall around my face. I smile, satisfied with my work I move on to the dress that I would wear, it was gorgeous, my jaw dropped as I picked it up gently, as if it was a bomb. It was my mother's; the beautiful dress hugged her curves as I remembered the pictures Father had shown me. It was beautiful, Corset type Dress with puffy sleeves, fitted me perfectly, the skirt flowed in an A-Line as it went from my waist. The capitol HAD to be impressed with this. I smoothed out my dress numerous times, the light white colour etched with light pink and purple flowers, flowed with the dress as I moved about my room. I Looked towards my brother and pinched his cheek, ruffling his messy hair affectionately and hugging my Father. I knew I would be back in an hour, I would be eating the feast with my family, seeing Blake the next day. If only I knew. Brushing down my dress once again, I place another pin in my hair. Looking into the dusty mirror as i'm finished, unable to hold it back anymore, i walk to the door, checking i am probably dressed and ready. I sigh and walk outside, an aura of Melancholy filled the air, a silence falling over our town as Children and Adults crowded around the Massive building. I signed in, the pricking of my finger sending a small jolt into my system, I would have hissed if I wasn't used to it. Walking to my place amongst the 15 year olds, I see our District representative walk up onto the stage. Effie's brilliant blue hair clashing against the grey outlook of our building, Her lips pursed in a cobalt expression as she overlooked all of our glum faces. Her clothes were different shades of blue, starting light and ending dark, with her shoes as darker blue as possible, her eyelashes long and extended, her face pale with makeup and her eyes heavily made up with different colours. She smiled at us, showing us some of her gold teeth. I cringed at her appearance. Her shrill voice rang out into the crowd as she tapped the microphone. "Welcome, Welcome" She says to us all. "Welcome to the 78th Hunger Games. May the Odds be ever in your favour" She gestures around to us all. "Now before we start I have a special film ALL the way from the capitol" Her voice reached a new level of high, I'm surprised the dogs didn't come running. Sniggering at my little side thought. I zone out, turning my attention to Blake. " WAR, Terrible War" I hear the start of the video I have heard numerous times since I was twelve. I saw the way Blake's hair sways in the gentle wind, and his lips curled in a smirk. I blink out of my day dream when I realise he is staring at me. I blush, smiling at him, turning back to the front. " The lone victor, bathed in riches, would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness. This is how we remember our past. This is how we safeguard our future" I hear the Video finish as Effie mimics the last two lines, her eyes shining with excitement. "Right." She says, strutting to the bowl of Female names. She reaches her hand in. After a little while of searching around she pulls out a white slip of paper. I see her open it in slow motion, Her lips slightly parted as I hear the one name that shocks my whole body to the core. "ABIGAIL MELDUNE!"
