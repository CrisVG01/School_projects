right?" Nonna asks lover boy, who smiles tightly. "Right." Edward chuckles, but then he looks to me, terrified. We are made for each other. Fifteen minutes later, Nonna not-so-discreetly seats Edward and me right by Aubree, as if we're going to be lured into parenthood by her magical cuteness. It's easy to get sucked it, I get it, my ovaries get it, but as soon as Aubree unleashes her pterodactyl cry on us, I jump back to square one and shake my head. No. Just no. "Mom," Dad says, shaking his head. "Bella doesn't need a baby right now. Maybe in ten years." "Ten?" Edward and his father say at the same time. Our heads all turn in different directions at the same time. I turn to Edward, wondering when the hell he thinks it's gonna happen. Carlisle looks at Charlie like he's gone mad, but not in the way I'm looking at Edward at all. "She's twenty-two," Dad says. "She's got some time to have children." "I agree," Carlisle bites out. "Maybe not ten years, but sure. I agree with you there." I palm my cheek. "Are they seriously fighting over our potential nonexistent child?" Edward takes a drink of beer and nods. "Yep." My mom smiles. "Welcome home, kids." "I'm not fighting," Carlisle disagrees. "I just think ten years …" "What?" Charlie asks, widening his arms. "You think they should have a baby now? Let them live their lives. They're not even married, for cripes sake!" "About that—" Edward begins, but Carlisle talks over them. "Oh, and you were?" He points to me. "Doesn't look like it to me." Nonna nods vehemently in agreement. She's definitely taking Carlisle's side on this one. I steal a drink of Edward's beer, watching them go back and forth as if it's a tennis match. It's just like old times, only there's a baby here with a prehistoric animal cry to give the argument more thunder. "Stop!" Edward cuts everyone off, standing abruptly. Even Aubree stops crying to hear what he has to say. "Baby, what's wrong?" I ask, reaching out to rub his shoulder. I know he doesn't like them fighting, but most of the time it's entertaining to him, not so much that he has to pause his meal to put an end to it. Edward's face softens when he looks down at me. "Nothing, babe. I just wanted to say something before people start throwing fists." He clears his throat and turns around, only for a second, before sitting back down. "Emmett told me to record this." Huh? He sets his phone down so it's facing us before turning to me. He looks so fucking nervous and excited, I don't know whether to shudder with fear or check him into the nearest hospital. My family really must be rubbing off on him. "Uh, what?" I ask. He smiles widely before taking my hand. "Bella Swan—" "He's proposing," Nonna whisper-screams to my mother, who looks like she clearly already knows what's going on. She's grinning widely and—wait … what! "You're proposing?!" I shout, turning back to Edward, who has gone back into sheepish mode. "I mean … go on," I encourage in a whisper, but inside my heart feels like its exploding emotions in my chest. Edward smiles softly, even if Nonna and I ruined his little proposal. He expected this. "Go on," I whisper once more. He chuckles. "Fine. I wrote a damn speech for this, so you'd better listen up. All of you, shut your mouths." He shoots the table a glare, especially Nonna, who simply pretends he isn't there. He turns back to me and picks up my hand, placing a kiss on the back of it. "Bella, for a long time I couldn't get you to speak to me. I spent day in and day out wondering what I had to do to get you on my side." I smile sadly at him, my heart aching as I remember the days I refused to talk to him. I still beat myself up over it. When I told my dad that I didn't talk to the Cullens, he'd already gotten past the shock of our kiss and moved on to wondering when we started becoming friends. " Why didn't you tell me, Bambina? I'm no fool. I know you can't spend forever avoiding your neighbors—look at me. I nearly choked Mr. Cullen today!" " I didn't want you to fight …" I trailed off in a whisper. "Especially because of Edward and me." Dad shook his head. "You can't try to fix something that isn't yours to fix, Bella. What happened between Mr. Cullen and me was our business; you shouldn't have been with me in the first place." "Maybe you didn't see it then, but I did, when you were standing in my doorway," Edward continues speaking to me like we're the only two people in the room, and it feels that way. "Even then, I knew you were all I needed, and you still are. Bella Swan, I love you. Will you marry me?" I smile until my cheeks burn. "Yes." "Yes?" he asks as if he thought I would really say no. Seriously? Come on. "Yes!" He pumps his fist in the air. He walks around Aubree and sweeps me into his arms, grinning so wide that our teeth nearly clash when he kisses me. "Where's the ring?" my father asks. "Will you shut your damn mouth and let them have this moment," Carlisle retorts. "Ridiculous!" Nonna shouts. "The both of you-a, shush!" We are not a perfect family, far, far from perfect in fact. So imperfect that I believed Edward and I had a doomed relationship that would sure result in tragedy, and I did everything I could to prevent that from happening. One day, I took a risk in hopes that our fathers would stop fighting, and it didn't exactly work, but I didn't stop trying. Love makes it impossible like that.
