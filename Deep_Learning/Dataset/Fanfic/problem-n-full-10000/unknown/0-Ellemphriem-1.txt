failed. His face paled. "I never asked you to care! And why the hell are you whispering? Did Mrs. Norris get your tongue or something?" she said triumphantly, but the brief pain she saw in his eyes wiped her smile away quickly. "Hermione, the Professor - " Minerva, begun but he raised his hand so threateningly that Teddy ran and grabbed onto Hermione's leg. "Enough! I shall not stand the presence of this underaged child inside my library. Be warned!" Severus hissed at both women. "Don't worry I'll make sure he doesn't bother you at all," Hermione said and met his eyes. Daring him to continue. Severus nodded and, with a warning glance at the small creature, he walked as majestically out of the room as his wet clothes and squishy boots allowed. Minerva sighed and crossed her hands in front of herself. When he was gone, it was as if the room exhaled in relief. Hermione pressed her lips together and rolled her eyes "I see some things never change," she said with a soft smile rubbing Teddy's back. "Hermione dear, Professor Snape lost his voice in the war." Minerva winced. Hermione looked up shocked. "What?" "When Nagini tore his throat, his vocal chords were destroyed. He can only whisper – although he prefers not to speak at all usually. Today was an exception to that rule." Remorse reared its ugly fangs and Hermione felt as if her stomach dropped into icy water. Oh, no! She thought and bit her lip. She had visited him many times in the hospital when he was in a coma. She had stayed with him as she had with other patients, to offer him comfort in his loneliness, but she didn't know about the damage to his vocal chords. In fact, she rarely – if ever – spoke with the doctors to learn any details. At the time they probably didn't know the extent of the damage themselves. What she cared about was him waking up. When he did, she took care to never bother him again. Until now. "Now this is awkward," she said looking down at the corridor he had left from. A feeling of sadness overflowed her; it was sudden and overwhelming. His voice had once been monumental, affecting its surroundings with its gravity. Now it was nil. This war had destroyed a lot of people. "You couldn't have known of course." Minerva pursed her lips. "I think I owe him an apology," she said honestly. "I think you should keep away from him. Approach him only when you need something from the library and keep it formal. Use very few words, only what is necessary." Minerva frowned down at her hands. Hermione lips turned down and met Minerva's eyes boldly. "The war broke him completely. Try to be formal towards him even though the Gryffindor in you might want to lash out at times. He was a difficult man to begin with, now he is impossible." Minerva spoke solemnly and her voice broke near the end. Hermione's eyes teared up unexpectedly. "The war broke all of us." "Not like it did him. Believe my words and keep your distance. Don't aggravate him, please. His stay here is hanging by a thread. I don't want to lose him." Minerva sounded more emotional than Hermione had ever heard her. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Professor Charity walk quickly out of the room. "I know he works here on parole. It was all over the news. He cannot leave or he will face a trial." Minerva winced briefly. "There are more ways to depart than one. He has been trying to find a way out for a long time now." Hermione's lips twitched in confusion. "I won't aggravate him, I swear. My conduct back there was totally inappropriate. You should know that I deeply respect him. He did a lot more than just protect us all these years. He's a bloody war hero isn't he? I just find it difficult to handle his offensive attitude." Minerva nodded sadly. "Not only you my dear. Now come let me show you your quarters." The rest of the staff had formed several groups, discussing in low tones, while others were already departing with warm handshakes and a few comforting words. "Are we going to sleep in the castle, Auntie?" Teddy pulled on her cardigan. "Yes," she smiled. "Near batman?" Hermione harked. "Batman?!" "The wet man that was making puddles? That's batman right?" Teddy asked. Minerva covered her mouth and laughed lightly. "Charming, young man." "I guess so, but don't ever tell him that, okay?" Hermione ruffled his green hair. "He doesn't know he is Batman?" "He doesn't want us to know that he is. It's a secret." Hermione placed her finger on her mouth to encourage his silence. Teddy jumped a couple of times and clapped. "Yes, a secret. I won't say anything. Now can we eat? I am hungry!" "Lunch is served at two and I shall expect you in my office after so I can show you around the Potion laboratories and apothecaries. You will have to work closely with Professor Sprout and her assistant Longbottom. We open the gates for the students in two day's time. We need to get through many details of your curriculum," Minerva explained, turning around at the third floor of the north tower. She took out a key and gave it to Hermione. "Welcome again, Hermione. It is a pleasure having you amongst the Hogwarts staff." Hermione looked at the keychain that bore the initial "H" on it and a huge smile brightened her face. Yes, she was indeed home. A flash of sadness stained that happiness, however, when she remembered the desolation in Snape's eyes. She needed reintroduction to old constants, she needed to get to know things again, and she knew she would have to work hard, but she was home. For the first time in years she felt…peace. *******...******* *******...*******
