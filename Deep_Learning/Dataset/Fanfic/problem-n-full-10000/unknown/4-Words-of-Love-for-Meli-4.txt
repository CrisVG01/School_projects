in running it. She knew Renee should help, as her guardian, but she also knew Renee hated horses and only knew how to spend money, not how to make it. She went to her neighbors and asked them for help. Ever since then, they left the training decisions to her but kept an eye on the business side of things. As Bella's education took shape, they took more and more of a back seat until they were just the advisors. Upon exiting the car, Alice grabbed her arm and towed her inside. When she pushed through the doors, she slammed into Jasper, who came rushing out of the office, a box of supplies in his arms. He cursed and looked down at the five foot four Alice on her six-inch heels, a scowl prominent on his face. Alice took one look at him and started to bat her eyelashes at him. He gave her a cursory glance before looking at who was with her. He greeted Bella with fervor, telling her he had to go to the Cullen Ranch because one of their best jumpers had colic. Alice huffed and ramped up the pouty lips and fluttering eyelashes. Jasper scowled at her and left the building at a run, eager to get to his car. Alice stated with confidence that that man would be her husband; she had just seen her future. Rose entered the building and grabbed Bella's other arm. She completed the tow, now two persons long toward the dance studio. Bella dug her heels in once they passed the door. "What are you doing? You know I'll go now, because you'll only go inside with me if you try it at the same time!" She hissed in an angry whisper. "Don't be absurd, Bella. Be glad we gave you these lessons, maybe you'll learn some elegance and sex appeal, it should at least be good exercise for that fat ass of yours. But this part is our gift to ourselves we're going to watch your clumsy ass get into trouble." Rose spoke in a whisper shout. Bella's eyes sprung full of tears and her face heated in unadulterated rage. She was so angry that her voice gave out, and she couldn't retaliate. The queens of mean had reached a new depth, she wasn't even sure they were still on this side of the earth. She should tear herself loose and run for cover with Emmett in the vet clinic. Before she could act on her plan, though, an ice-cold voice spoke to her wardens. "Our lessons are private, you should've noticed that when you bought the package. Furthermore, we don't allow bullies into our establishment. Your remarks plainly put you in that category. So if you do not intend to attend the lessons yourself, there's the door please close it behind you." A beautiful, statuesque woman strode their way, her eyes blazing, their stare unwavering on Alice and Rose. The girls were so flustered that they were caught, they dropped Bella's arms like hot potatoes and faced the woman dressed in a tight, light blue polo shirt with the studio's logo on the pocket and a simple, white, flaring skirt falling down to her calves. Alice twitched at the colors but found her voice the fastest; her brain, however, had difficulty keeping up as she blurted, "But we gave her the lessons! We should, at least, be able to watch her fall on her ass!" "That just crossed the line even more. I'll tell you one more time, GET OUT, or I'll call the authorities and tell them that I've unwanted intruders here." The woman spoke through clenched teeth. Her natural blonde hair slicing the air with her movement as her arm stabbed in the direction of the door. The slut sisters scurried out of the building as fast as they could, followed by the enraged stare of the woman and the bemused one of her next-door neighbor, Emmett. He doubled over in laughter when Rose's left heel became stuck in a crack of the pavement and broke off, landing the Barbie doll sprawling on the blacktop. The most unladylike stream of curses left her mouth when she limped on one heel to Alice's car, holding the pieces of her color-of-the-day-defying, red-soled shoe in her hand. The woman took a deep breath, rolled her shoulders and turned to face Bella. "Are you Bella Swan?" Bella couldn't speak yet, but she nodded. "My name is Kate, my husband, Garrett, and I own this studio. Looking at your agitated state your eagerness to learn to pole dance is as big as mine regarding meeting clowns, which is non-existent to be clear." That did it, with her flippant remark, Kate broke through Bella's rage and she laughed. "That's about right, they forced me to come. I think they're now bitching about it being a waste of money. Well at least I halved my bitch exposure for the next eight weeks. They booked me on Wednesday afternoons themselves. Even if they won't know I'm not going it's the best excuse ever." Kate looked perturbed, "All our classes are the same rate, isn't there something else a little less provocative you'd like to try. Our best ballroom instructor is present today even though his agenda is empty." Bella thought about it. She loved the cooperation between herself and her horse when she worked on the choreography. The possibility to experience that with another person could be interesting. She took a full minute to consider her options; an entirely free afternoon, or a new experience. "You know, I'm here now so I'm going to try it. If I don't like it I can always take the afternoon off. Thank you, for suggesting it." Kate smiled and escorted Bella to one of the private instruction rooms. It was one of the smaller ones because she thought it would be beginner level box stepping. "Wait here; our instructor will be with you in a minute."
