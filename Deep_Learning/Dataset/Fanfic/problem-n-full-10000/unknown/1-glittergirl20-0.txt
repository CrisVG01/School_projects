Johanna. "They should know." She says. She smiles. I roll my eyes. "Johanna-" "Relax Katniss knows it's Thresh's house. We'll be fine." She says. "I guess." I mumble. "Although if you're ditching me to have sex-" "Please shut up." I say. She rolls her eyes. "I don't know why you get so embarrassed everyone in here has probably fucked someone before." "Well I don't get why you like to share about how good some guys are. I didn't need to know everything you told me about when you were dating Thresh." She rolls her eyes. "Well some guys are totally clueless. I don't think the guys you fucked before Finnick made you yell so loud to the point of being embarrassed." I scowl at her. There was only one other guy before Finnick. We only dated for a few months. I think I just did it to get it over with it already. I see Johanna is still talking about something crude. "Please stop." I say angrily. "Went overboard?" She smiles. "Yes." I say. "Sorry." She says sincerely. "It's fine." I say. She nods. "Even if you don't go to the party can you work on Katniss getting to see Peeta more." "Peeta wanted to see her last night." I say. "Yeah but at night ." She says. "Peeta said she was complaining about her roommates." I say and shoot a look at her knowing her, Katniss, and Madge share an apartment. "That didn't mean she wanted to fuck him." Johanna says. "I think Peeta was just trying to be nice." I say. She shrugs. "Whatever." She smiles. "Can I come over to your house before the party?" She asks. I shake my head. "I have work to do and you are very distractfull." I say. "I know that's why you wanted to live alone." I nod. "But I bet Finnick is a bigger distraction." She smiles. "Johanna-" "Alright I get it. I made enough sex comments." "Yes you have." I stand up with my tray. "But I really need to go. I'm already behind on my studies." "Annie Cresta being behind means she is at the same pace as everyone else." "I have a full ride Johanna I need good grades." "I know." She says and we leave the student center. I head back to my apartment. When I get inside I throw my keys on the table and lock the door. I set my laptop on the coffee table and start typing away. I hear my phone buzz. I'm expecting Johanna making some wise ass mark but it's Finnick. Finnick: How was tutoring? Me :Fine… I guess. He asked me out. It was weird. Johanna said he fooled around with Katniss before . Finnick: Interesting . Me : She also told me that Katniss wants to see more of Peeta. Finnick: Even more interesting :) I roll my eyes. Finnick: Are you going to play match maker then? Me: Maybe . I text back. Finnick: I'm about to head out. Just wanted to see if you wanted to come. Me : It's a little early to start partying isn't it? It is barely five, and why why is everyone asking me to party with them this weekend? Finnick: I'm just going to a preparty won't be drinking… yet. And we all want to b ecause we all love you ;) Me: Maybe. :) Have fun without me and please don't drink too much we all know you are a puker. Finnick: :) I'll be fine. See you tomorrow? Me: Yeah . Finnick: Love you. Me: Love you too. I work on my paper and get seven and a half pages by midnight. All I have to do is proofread then I'll be finished. I guess I could've gone to a party then... this isn't due for another week. I figure I could look at Finnick's paper now but I'm not going to. I don't have the patience to do that without him. I turn on the television and keep it on the channel that is playing The Avengers. I feel my eyes get hazy when Loki gets captured in Germany. I bolt awake when I hear a knock on the door. It's three am. Who would knock on my door this late? I think to myself. I figure I shouldn't open it but I go to the door and look through the peep hole anyways. I see it is Katniss . I open the door. "Uh hi." Katniss says. "What do you want?" I ask slightly angry that she woke me up. "I was wondering if I could… sleep here. Johanna is still uh… indisposed. I don't want to walk home it's… well sketchy." She's lucky she got to my house unscratched especially with what she is wearing. Short jean shorts and a shirt that bares her midriff. "Why can't you stay at Thresh's house?" I ask more awake. "It's disgusting." She says. "Fine." I say and open the door and the lock the doors back up. "You can sleep on the couch or floor. I don't care just don't throw up." "I'm not that drunk." She says. I shrug. I pull out the basket of blankets from under the coffee table. "Here." I say. "Thanks." Katniss says and lies down. "Sorry I woke you." "Don't worry about it." I sigh. "If you do want to throw up the bathroom is back there." I say and she nods. "If you don't think you can make it go for the kitchen sink." I say. She just nods. I'm surprised she remembers where I live she's only been here twice. I stretch my hands above my head and fall to the bed. I fall asleep almost instantly. I figure I can worry about this tomorrow. A/N: This is more of a pilot chapter. I've only dabbled in modern day universes and I wanted to see where this would go. Tell me in the comments please.
