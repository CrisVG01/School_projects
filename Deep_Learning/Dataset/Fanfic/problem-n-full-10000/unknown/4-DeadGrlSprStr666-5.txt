Forks. You have had welcome in our area for the LAST time. Do not come back here." He laughs, "I assure you, we have no intention to." I snap my phone closed and Jared has to physically restrain me to keep me from launching it across the cab, "Damn it Sam! That's your fifth phone this year!" **Meanwhile BPOV** Cold, I'm so fucking cold. I feel like I'm trapped in frigid waters, struggling to break the surface, I'm nauseous, I can't breathe, I can't move. I hear my dad yelling, screaming at me, and though from this dark corner of my mind I know he's right up in my face, it sounds like he's yelling for me from a million miles away. I hear a woman's voice, so faint it seems like it almost can't be real, but I know it is. There's a stranger in my room, and she very gently removing my soaking wet clothes, drying me with a towel, and replacing dry clothing on me. I can't even lift my limbs to help her. I'm trapped in my own mind. The last image I have is of silver grey eyes staring into my own, everything after that is blackness, shadows moving on the barely visible screen. **Charlie POV** Shit, this is bad. This is very bad. Kay snaps at me as I open my mouth to start calling Bella again, "Charlie don't! She isn't going to answer. You need to get a doctor here. This is not normal. She's basically catatonic." Bella lurches forward as if pulled, but all that happens is she vomits into the trash can that Kay luckily placed at the side of the bed. I run my hands through my hair, "It's drugs. It has to be drugs. Heroin or something like that. She must have shot up in the woods." Kay rolls her eyes, "You're welcome to go over her Charlie, I'm telling you the girl has not one needle mark. Not one track." I snap at her, "Look at her Kay! She's a zombie! She just puked, now she's passed out, and she's lost at least 10 pounds in the time she's been here! Thank God that Renee is on that pilgrimage with her new husband. We'll get Bella cleaned up and she'll never have to know that I let our only daughter develop a smack habit in the first 6 months she lived with me!" Kay sighs in exasperation, "Go in my bag and get the butterfly needle and the blood vial you asked for, we'll take a blood sample and put this to rest one way or the other." **One Week Later Charlie POV** The tests had come back negative. For everything. As soon as I knew that I brought in a doctor. Dr. White is the best psychiatric specialist that Forks has to offer. He came very highly recommended. He examined Bella, and determined that she had suffered a psychiatric break. He was very doubtful that she would ever snap out of it. He wanted to put her on a feeding tube, but I told him that I put food in her room every day, and that it was always eaten when I came back. Though usually she left about a quarter of it on the plate. This led him to the conclusion that Bella was faking. He told me that if she would eat and get up and use the facilities as long as I didn't bother her than I should just accept that she didn't want to socialize with me and my choices were to commit her, or to hope for a change. Since she was on summer vacation anyway I chose to just let her continue on her own. I went back to work after the third day, and I started staying at Kay's the way I usually would when Bella hadn't lived with me with the exception of stopping in a few times a day to leave her something to eat. **Sam POV** I stop by Chief Swan's to see how Isabella is doing, I never go inside. I don't want to freak her out. Instead I watch her from the tree outside her window. She mechanically eats the sandwich that her dad brought her earlier. The look on her face never changes, I doubt if she even realizes she's actually eating. Most likely her body just moves on autopilot. It's been about a week now, and I'm hoping for some sign of life today. Jared had told me that sometimes if he thought about Kim really hard she would call him to see if anything was up. He called it the Imprint Bat signal. I've been trying it with Isabella, but mostly she just lays on her bed staring at the ceiling and muttering 'he's gone'. I sit back in the tree, I concentrate all my energy on Isabella, thinking her name so hard its practically in neon inside my head. Being in the tree was stupid, if she did wake up out of her catatonic state and look out the window I'd probably scare her right back into it. Shaking it off, I concentrate again, Isabella, Isabella, I don't know if you can hear me Isabella, I just want you to get better. I wish you could give me a sign Isabella, give me some sign that you're going to be okay Isabella. Please Isabella. My head jerks up as I hear a small voice say, "Please. Call me Bella." She's still laying back on her bed, eyes on the ceiling, but she says it again, and I watch her lips move, "Please. Call me Bella." Jumping out of the tree, I phase and do a victory lap in the woods. Fuck that feels fantastic! I know she's not just gonna be normal tomorrow, but the fact that she spoke, that I was able to mentally reach her, even if she was dreaming. Somehow it feels like she's going to be okay.
