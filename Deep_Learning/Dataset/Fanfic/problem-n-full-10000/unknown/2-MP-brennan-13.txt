and tired all at once. Her voice had nearly caught when she said the name 'Arandur.' "Mama," he said, "Ada said Arandur is a lord. What's he lord of? Can I go see his castle?" "He doesn't have a castle," Mama said absently, "He comes from one of the Dúnedain villages across the Bruinen." Estel sighed. When grown-ups said 'across the Bruinen,' they just meant 'really far away.' "But, if he's a lord, how come he was in the wilds?" "He had to bring Laleth here." "But, why? Is she his son?" "Girls are daughters, not sons. " "Daughters?" " Ieldnath. Not ionnath ." "Oh. Is she his daughter ?" "No. He simply feels responsible for her." Estel bit his lip. 'Responsible' was one of those tricky Westron words. Sometimes it meant one thing, sometimes the opposite. Mama didn't think Estel was responsible enough to not break her favorite vase, but if he did break it, then he would be responsible for that. It was very confusing. But, as far as he could remember, responsible was something you were, not something you felt. "How come?" "Never you mind." Mama tried to usher him out into the bedroom, but Estel twisted away. "How come you get that look when you talk about Arandur? Does he make you sad?" "Never you mind." Her voice was now distant, but the pinched look was more distinct than ever. Estel hated seeing that look on Mama's face. He turned away and darted into the bedchamber. Some of Mama's supplies were strewn across the counter under the window—the oils and salves she made, the bandages she wove for Ada. Estel ran to the counter, grabbed a short length of bandage material, and twisted it into a ring. Draping the towel around himself like fine robes, he climbed up onto Mama's bed and placed the linen on top of his damp curls. Giggling, he turned to her as water dripped down onto her bedclothes. "Look, Mama, I'm a king!" She laughed as she swept him up in her arms and held him close. "Yes. Yes you are." But, even her laughter sounded sad. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/ The next morning found him sitting outside Laleth's room once more, trying to spin a small top. When the door creaked open, he quickly forgot the toy. Arandur stepped out, his face drawn. "Are you her ada?" Estel's question seemed to take the Man by surprise. His face flashed with that strange, pained yet awed expression he'd worn when he first seen Estel. "Of course not," he said after a moment, "Her father is dead." Estel looked back down at the top in his hands. "Yeah," he said, "So's my papa." "I am sorry." There was a hitch to Arandur's voice. Estel looked up at him inquisitively. "Maybe you are her ada," he suggested, "Adas take care of you. Even if you haven't got a papa anymore." Arandur swallowed hard. He knelt before Estel and met his eyes. "And does your ada take care of you, child?" Estel flashed a smile. "Of course. He's Ada." /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/ That night, Estel was allowed to stay in the Hall of Fire until far past his bedtime. He sat on the hearth and played with his wooden knights while the Elves sang songs and told story after story. Unusually, Ada contributed by regaling Estel with tales of dragons and their misdeeds. He seemed determined to impress upon Estel that dragons were not to be tamed. For hours, Mama did not appear to spirit Estel away. When, at last, she came, her eyes were red, but the tension was gone from her face. She picked Estel up and squeezed him tight—almost too tight. Estel wiggled for a moment, then stilled and patted her shoulder. "What's wrong, Mama?" She sniffed and swallowed hard. Estel felt her smile. She'd been crying, but for the first time in weeks, she didn't seem sad. "Nothing, my baby," she murmured, "Nothing at all." /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/ Estel bounded through the garden, his arms outstretched, the hem of his traveling cloak clutched in sweaty hands. He was flying! Flying like Eärendil through the sky! The leafy branch tucked in the back of his collar was actually Vingilot's mast, and the flapping wool in his hands made its shining sails. The bits of mulch and gravel that flew before his feet were all the hosts of Morgoth. A flash of color caught his eye. He skidded to a stop so fast he almost fell over. Vingilot's sails fluttered to the ground to land among the hosts of Morgoth, all of them forgotten for the moment. In a neat flowerbed beneath the cherry trees, there grew a stand of irises almost as tall as Estel. The green stems stood straight and proud, like soldiers at attention, capped with purple blossoms like intricate helmets. All but one. At the very edge of the bed drooped a flower with a bent and broken stem. Careless feet—most likely Estel's—had trod on it before its petals had ever had a chance to open. Somehow it bloomed, nonetheless, though the stem had healed crookedly such that the delicate satin petals lay limp on the ground. Insects had nibbled at the blossom until it lost its furled scrollwork. Estel plucked the flower gently from the base, taking only the blossom so that the leaves could live again. He held it up in front of his face, letting it swing slowly back and forth like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. The bugs had chewed tiny tears into the petals. They fluttered and drooped like rags. Or, depending on how you looked at it, like ribbons. It was beautiful, to Estel's eyes. When Laleth finally awoke, she found a ragged flower on her bedside table. TBC Author's Note: Hope you enjoyed! There will be one more chapter to this tale, which will incorporate several time jumps and will focus more on Laleth and her recovery. Reviews of all kinds are deeply appreciated.
