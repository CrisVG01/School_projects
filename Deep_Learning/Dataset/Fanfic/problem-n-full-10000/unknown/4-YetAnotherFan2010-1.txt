back to reality. I opened my eyes to see Maria watching me with a tantalizing smile. I winked at her and leaned forward. My lips grazed her ear as I whispered charming lies to her. We talked and touched and soon after we kissed, and before we knew it, we were heading upstairs to find an empty room. Between the alcohol and my teenage lust, I was lost in the moment. Touching, kissing, rubbing. Pleasure took over everything and it felt amazing. Until the door opened and Edward was standing there, his face contorted in pain, his eyes bleak and shocked. He swiftly turned away and left us. I felt frozen, my desire drowned in a bucket of ice. Something deep inside ached horribly. I wanted to run after him but I knew I shouldn't. Maria laughed and pulled me back down toward her. I resisted and stared at her. I felt disgusted with her, with me, with what we were about to do. I untangled myself from her and pulled away. "I'm sorry but I should really go find Edward. He didn't look well." She rolled her eyes, laughing, and pushed herself up to a sitting position on the bed. "His virgin mind just got traumatized by what he saw. He'll get over it. Maybe it will even help him to grow some." I put my jeans on and walked out. I heard her call after me but I didn't care. I didn't look for Edward, because I couldn't face him, and so I just left the party and went outside, the fresh air embracing me nicely. I walked home and passed out on the living room couch. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** A piercing scream from upstairs startled me awake. I felt disoriented. I didn't know where I was. I looked around but the light coming through the window was blinding. I slumped back down of the sofa and shut my eyes closed. My head was hurting like shit and I had a mean hangover. Something was nagging at me from the inside, making my chest ache. I could still remember the mixture of strong feelings from my dream. It was leaving me a bad aftertaste. Hurried steps rushed towards me and Rosalie plopped herself next to me on the sofa. "Did you hear me scream earlier?" She asked with excitement. "I think all of Forks heard you, Rosie!" I answered sarcastically, keeping my eyes closed to soothe my headache. "Wellâ€¦ ask me why, Jazzy." I groaned and pretended to be asleep. It didn't work, Rosie kept talking. "I was on the phone with Bella," she said, stopping for dramatic effect, "and she just told me that her and Eddie finally got together!" She cheered with pure joy, jumping up and down and making the whole sofa shake. My nausea worsened and I felt dizzy. "Isn't this great? After all this time of pining after each other, they finally did it. I knew they were meant for each other." I rolled off the sofa and ran to the bathroom and threw up. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** We were all sitting at the diner. The whole crew. It was only the beginning of the summer but we were feeling the changes of life after high school. Rosie, Kate and I would start college in Seattle in the fall. Alice and Pete were also coming to Seattle since Ali got a year internship in some fashion agency and Pete was following her. Emmett had already started working at the construction site with his dad and Garr was working full-time now as a mechanic. Edward was the only one moving far away. He was going to Berkley University. I told myself it was for the best. He messed me up sometimes and I wished he didn't make me feel the way I feel when he's near. I glanced at him. Bella was clenching his hand tightly. He was looking around but he appeared tensed. He seemed worried and tired. His eyes fell on mine and we stared for a few seconds. His eyes were shining but there was no happiness. I wondered if he wanted to cry. "So, uhm, Eddie and I have something to tell you guys," Bella's soft voice interrupted our moment. He tore his eyes away from mine and looked at his girlfriend and smiled. She nudged him a little and asked him to be the one to tell us. "Yes, we have great news to share and you guys are the most important people in our lives so we want you to be the first to know. We're having a baby and we're getting married." We all gasped at the same time and then the girls shrieked with excitement and the guys threw profanities of congratulations and encouragement. But me, I never exhaled out. I held my breath in, afraid of letting anything out, afraid of what scream or cry or plea would come out of my mouth if I let go of my breath. They were all hugging and shaking hands and I couldn't even see his face with everybody around them. I felt like I was falling into a dark hole. I blamed myself. I told him to go for her. I told him to choose not to be gay. But it hurt all the same. When we all parted that night. I hugged Bella and congratulated her. And then I shook Edward's hand, our eyes locked, and I tried to congratulate him but nothing came out. He didn't say a word either. It felt final. I stayed far away from everybody the whole summer. I planned my escape secretly. And right after the wedding, I left. Without a warning. Without an explanation. Without a goodbye. ...
