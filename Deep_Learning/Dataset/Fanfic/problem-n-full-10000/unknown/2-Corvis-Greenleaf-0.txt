One shook her head and turned away. Eomer pulled her back. "You will work on his as though he was your own son!" He had fought to keep the anger out of his voice and when the woman saw that he was Eomer, nephew of Theoden, she did as she was told and started to work. Eomer didn't leave. Why he had stayed was a mystery even to him, but there was a need in him to see this wound treated to the very end. Whatever way it went. Once the bandages were in place, Haldir was lost in a sea of cloth, covering his chest and his arm. The smell of healing herbs was strong in the air and all that was left to do was wait. One of the women warned him that if he made it through the night, there would be hope. Aragorn had come later in the night, around the time that Haldir burned with fever. Aragorn's face had been a grim specter on the other side of the cot. He warned that an Elf rarely sweated, nor shook in the throes of fever. This was a bad sign. It was that time that Eomer had taken the Elf's hand and muttered his words of encouragement. Aragorn had noted the gesture and faded back into the shadows and out the door. Nothing that they could offer was more potent than what the man was doing for the Elf. He pushed the still tangled and bloody hair away from Haldir's face and peered into his eyes. Haldir had been awake, although assumed he was lost in a dream. He could see all the things that the Man was doing for him, but there was no way to break the reverie that his mind had trapped him in. Legolas came as Eomer was taken by sleep. He had helped the Man get comfortable and brought him a cover. He had looked into Haldir's eyes and seemed to see the struggle that raged beneath them. He nodded and grasped Haldir's hand, and then was gone from the room. There was a space of time that night when darkness took his mind, and he still could not remember what had happened in that span of time. He remembered the agony as he tried to speak in the darkness. His throat parched and bloody, he had called out. And then there had been peace. *~*~*~**~*~*~*~**~*~*~***~ Eomer remembered that first guttural moan that escaped the Elf before him. It was an awakening for him. It was a cry of pain, yes, but also had fight in it. There was hope yet. "As the sun rose that morning and hit your face, you spoke, Haldir." Eomer recalled. "I remember naught but of that first cry." Haldir admitted. He needed to know what was said in that time, he was sure that in that moment of peace he had spoken, but the words were not in his memory, just the feelings that grasped him. Eomer carried on with the story. "I spoke, trying to encourage you to come back, and I said" "Such beauty, almost lost. And all for the better of Men. What was their gain in this matter? None. Wake, please wake, and show me that all hope has not truly been lost." Haldir finished for him. Eomer nodded. "And you replied to me. After I spoke, you replied." Haldir waited, knowing what was to come, but wanting to hear the Man say it. "Do not lament my beauty lost, Son of Man, for I am alive. All is not lost, I am the hope that you seek." Eomer softly finished. ~*~*~*~~*~~*~*~~*~*~*~~*~*~ There had been brilliance. It rushed at him like a blinding light and he felt strong hands run over his body. They cleansed him and restored him. They placed words in his throat and pushed them out with a breath of calming wind. Kissed by the Valar and blessed with a life that was restored, Haldir basked in that golden light. He was at peace, but was not perished. He felt an abundance of this newfound glory and radiated it like a candle. When next he opened his eyes, there was Eomer, the sunlight behind him, crowning him with the same golden light that emanated from his own skin. And he knew that their fates were as one. If one bled, the other would feel it. It was indescribable. Haldir kept a steady gaze on those eyes for as long as his strength would allow it, and then succumbed to the healing sleep that washed over him like a current. And Eomer too had rested. The worst was over, and there was hope again in his life. Nothing was ever truly lost. *~**~*~**~*~**~*~**~*~*~**~*~* "Where do we go from here, Son of Man?" Haldir asked. There was silence as the two pondered what was to come. Both had lived through it all, raised above the darkness that sought to engulf them. Haldir had taken Lord Celeborn's command over the Golden Wood, much as Eomer had succeeded Theoden as King of Rohan. What place did they hold together no, divided by realms and status? "I would have what peace we have found together." Eomer stated. Haldir didn't speak immediately, afraid that the man did not know the implications of what he had said. More afraid that said lightly, he would be dismissed later for a multitude of reasons. This was a pact that would change Haldir's fate forever, and he did not want the Man to think that he was doing it out of obligation. "What peace would that be?" He asked, searching for any ill intention from the Man. "To live as one, to know the light that you have brought to me. To stand shoulder to shoulder with you ever more." Eomer responded. Haldir could read no sign of falter from the man. He let a small smile come to his face. "I would know the same." He replied.
