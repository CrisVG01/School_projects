and put it on Tom's grave before Harry backed up to stare at each grave then Harry noticed something there right in the middle of all of the graves was a candle that was a oddly colored green and the sky did look like it was getting darker so leaning forward and trying not to put pressure on his leg Harry picked up the candle and with a flare a green flame appeared on the top of the candle and Harry instantly noticed several shapes around him each one was a child well except for one large kid then one of the kids walked forward he had on a smiling white as snow mask that covered his face completely and with what skin Harry could see was scratched up and scared "Tim" Harry said and the kid nodded before he leaned down and picked up his knife then turning the blade around he handed it to Harry "Well We're not much but how would you like to join are little group" Tim said and Harry was both happy and scared they were nice but for how long will that last but either way Harry knew what he would say "Thank you" Harry said as he grabbed ahold of the knife handle and he watched as Tim turned into mist and seemed to go through him then another person that looked almost exactly like Tim stepped forward but unlike Tim this kid's mask was on anger and had several cracks in it and what's more while this child did have scar's he also had several broken bones sticking out of place's heck his neck was broken "Tom" Harry asked and the kid nodded "Yep heh what did you think I was just going to leave to walk out of this forest without a little help" Tom said picking up his leg brace and putting it back on Harry's leg where it shrunk and twisted till it was the perfect size for Harry then Tom turned to mist and went through Harry and slowly Harry began to feel cold then there was a little girl in a pink bunny suit that walked up she was hopping around and had a smile on her pale face but her eyes showed only darkness and just a tiny bit of light "Hey you can't leave without someone to help you keep the darkness away" Lillian said handing Harry her Rabbit doll that shifted and changed till it turned into a jacket with a rabbit patch on it's shoulders then Lillian turned to mist and went through Harry "Thank you" Harry said and he felt Lillian as she smiled then Harry watched as one of the last two kids moved forward and he had to resisted the attempt to run because this one looked the worse for wear he was stuck on all four's and it looked like his skin had decayed heck his eyes looked to be gone from his sockets and what's more there was barely anything on him that would point him out to be a child spirit "Yeah I look pretty bad huh I guess it comes with being the second oldest" Caleb said before he reached down and taking off one of his shoe's and picking up it's partner he handed them over to Harry "Well I think you'll be needing this luck more than I will beside's I can't run around anymore with these but you, you can run for me" Caleb said before he tried to smile with his broken jaw then he watched as Harry put on the shoes before moving forward and ignoring his mind telling him this was a terrible idea he hugged the ghastly looking ghost who froze in surprise "Thank you Caleb I'll wear them always" Harry said before he felt Caleb turn to mist and go through him then the largest of them appeared in front of Harry and roared this caused Harry to back up a bit till he heard Lillian talking in his ear "Don't worry that's just Benny saying hello he wants to give you his Cross because when he was alive it protected him when he needed it most" Lillian said and slowly Harry moved back forward to pick up the cross and it was only then that he noticed in the light the slight red on the bottom of the cross and looking over he saw a hole in Benny's neck "Yep it protected Benny till the end even when he took his own life because he was in need of ours" Tim said "Yeah Benny's one of the best big brothers He'd protect you from anyone even if it got him in trouble" Lillian said and walking toward the large behemoth that looked the least harmed of the ghost's Harry smiled at the large kid who bent down to pat him on the head then he turned into mist and went through Harry like his siblings and then Harry turned around only to find his new family standing there in the moonlight and with a tug of the ground and some looking around Harry tied the cross around his neck and then headed off into the forest with his family and then each of them one by one turned into mist and went rushing through the woods and Harry tried to copy what they did and turned to mist and followed his new family into the night and slowly the green candle's flame was blown out by a unseen person and anyone that was in the forest at that moment would have paused in fright from Harry's laughter at what he had done. Well Harry's joined the Weaver family and before you ask no Harry's not dead but he does have most of the same ability's as the Weaver children do what actually happened was that they had connected there spirit's to Harry and you will see why I chose to do the story this way later
