it to be." "So you promise that Hades doesn't want to have a threesome with us? Because I'm not really... into that." "You're not into a threesome with Hades, but you're into pegging?" "Shut up about that. That's for special times. Besides, he acted a lot like you which is pretty terrifying. Don't let him touch me." "Chill, babe. Ain't nobody gonna touch you but me anymore." "And in bed the other night. Why didn't you wanna have sex with me? I was so horny and you pushed me away!" "Good." "What?" "Nothing. I um... I felt a little sick. Sorry I acted so weird. We can do it anytime you want. You know I'm always in the mood." "What about now?" she insisted. He laughed. "After you, babe." Hades was scared. Hades was beyond scared. "How can I talk you out of this?" "You can't. We're doing this right now." "No we aren't!" he protested, backing up to the corner of the room, "I want to be able to sit! This isn't how I wanted to spend my afternoon!" "You're the one who brought it up." "You're delusional! Insane, even!" "Baby, nooooo." "Baby, yes!" he screeched, tackling a lamp in a desperate attempt to flee from certain doom. He sprinted down the hallway, not daring to look behind him. After running passed the first hallway, he made an immediate left turn and continued to scream as he ran through the hallways. "What's all that screaming about?" Hera asked Zeus, propping the door open slightly. Almost instantly, Hades came barreling down the hallway. "Didn't you say we weren't doing the threesome? Because Hades is screaming down the hallway, completely naked." "No! We're not! I don't know what he's doing." Zeus rushed to the door. "Yo, put some clothes on!" In the distance, he heard a distant cry for help. "DEMETER. DEMETER, DEMETER, HI! PLEASE PROTECT ME! PERSEPHONE IS A MANIAC AND SHE WANTS TO PUT THINGS IN MY BUTT." "What? Why don't you have clothes on?" "It's a long story. Just don't let her touch me!" "Okay, okay," she said, slightly distracted by his body. "Uh... what do you need me to do?" "Tell her not to touch me," he pouted, standing almost directly behind her. "Should I put my shirt back on? Mmm, that's a good idea." "No, don't! That's a... sign of weakness! I'll protect you. Don't worry." "You're a lifesaver," he sighed. She smirked to herself. Persephone met Demeter and Hades in the hallway after checking all the rooms he passed. "He's being a baby. We were about to have sex and he ran away." "Ohhh. That would explain why he's so... naked." "That isn't sex!" he stammered, stepping out from behind her, "That's torture! I never agreed to any of it." "What is he so scared of?" Demeter asked. "Pegging! It's not that bad, is it? He's being a big baby." "I'm with Hades here," she glanced at his body again, "That sounds pretty painful." "Everyone's a critic," Persephone grumbled. "Fine. Maybe we can do this another time." "Never. We are doing that never . Thanks again, Demeter. I owe you one." "Don't mention it. Anything for a friend," she mused. [Demeter's POV] I didn't know what to think. You can't blame me for looking! Hades was running towards me, completely naked. What would you expect me to do, not look? Shield my eyes from that fine piece of ass? "Yo, put some clothes on!" I heard Zeus scream, catching my attention. I figured he wouldn't be yelling at Hera because he prefers her clothes off. "DEMETER!" I heard Zeus shriek, seeing me on the side of the hallway. "DEMETER, DEMETER, HI! PLEASE PROTECT ME!PERSEPHONE IS A MANIAC AND SHE WANTS TO PUT THINGS IN MY (suggestive region)." Persephone? I didn't think she was into that kind of stuff. But god damn, Hades was fine. "What? Why don't you have clothes on?" "It's a long story. Just don't let her touch me!" "Okay, okay," I stutter, trying to focus on his body above the waistline. "Uh... what do you need me to do?" "Tell her not to touch me," he pouted, standing closely behind me. I could feel his breath on the back of my neck. "Should I put my shirt back on? Yeah, I probably should." "No, don't! That's a... sign of weakness! I'll protect you. Don't worry." Hah, yeah. That was totally a sign of weakness. Demeter: 1, Hades: 0. And he's still naked. "You're a lifesaver," he sighed. I smirked while he was still behind me. Persephone caught up to Hades and I in the hallway after she checked every room. Damn, she really wanted that ass of his, I thought to myself. I didn't blame her. "He's being a baby. We were about to have sex and he ran away." Yeah, that explains why Hades is naked and afraid. "That isn't sex!" he stammered, stepping out from behind me, "That's torture! I never agreed to any of it." "What is he so scared of?" I asked. "Pegging! It's not that bad, is it? He's being a big baby." Um, ow? "I'm with Hades here," I took a quick glance at his body once more, "That sounds pretty painful." "Everyone's a critic," she grumbled. "Fine. Maybe we can do this another time." "Never. We are doing that never. Thanks again, Demeter. I owe you one." "Don't mention it. Anything for a friend." "Oh, one more thing. I see you checking out Hades. Don't think you're so sly." "I would never!" I gasped, glancing at him again. Hades looked at me. I think he was deciding if he wanted to put his shirt back on. Good thing he didn't. "You just were! God, I just wanted to have a good time. Hades, come on. We still have time to kill." "Well, I wanted to save my ass from destruction and I think I did a pretty good job." I snickered. Anything for a friend.
