down the street to the tiny off licence and grabbed a chocolate bar for him, walking back quickly. "Here you go," I threw it to him, smiling as he caught it easily. "Here have some." He threw half the bar at me, chuckling as I leapt up to catch it. "Thanks." I leant on the side of the car. "Jacob?" A male voice shouted from outside the garage. "Shit," Jake bit his lip. "Who is that?" I mouthed. "Sam." He mouthed back. "Go, back door!" I tiptoed out of the back door, making my way home as quickly as possible. I was about to cross the street when I ran into someone… "Bella? What are you doing?" Thank god it was Sam and not Paul. "I was um… Walking. In the woods. And stuff… Um… What are you doing?" I redirected. "Paul asked me to check on you." He nodded, taking a deep breath through his nose. "He did?" I seethed. "You weren't walking were you?" he sighed. "No I wasn't… But I didn't do anything wrong !" I grumbled. "Shit… Um well, go home and shower before Paul get back. Please don't let me find you with Jacob again." he shook his head at me condescendingly, walking off without so much as a goodbye. "Ugh!" I kicked a can across the street before taking Sam's advice. Once more, I had dinner in the oven by the time Paul got home. "Hey," He greeted, coming in the front door. I pretended he wasn't there. "Hello? Bella?" He appeared behind me a little too fast for my human senses. "What do you want?" I mumbled childishly. "How about a hello when I come home?" He suggested, reaching around me to grab a beer from the fridge. "Hello! I'm robot Bella, nice to see ya' honey!" I chimed in a too-sweet tone, a feigned smile clear to see. "Grow up Bella." He growled, storming off into his study. "Whatever." I huffed. I hated feeling like this, like the breath in his lungs was there only to annoy me. At least Sam hadn't told him where he found me, or there would have been a real fight. The timer chimed, telling me the lasagne was ready. I pulled it out, throwing together salad and serving it on the table. "Paul!" I reluctantly called. I heard the door open and slam shut, as he thundered back into the kitchen. "I don't know what your problem is but… Oh. Food." He sat down, forgetting all about whatever he was about to say. I let out a relieved breath, picking up my fork. Suddenly a phone started ringing. "Is that me or you?" He patted his pockets. "You." I said between mouthfuls. "Oh. Sam." He looked at me suspiciously before answering, going back into the study. Crap. I ate quickly, nervously waiting for him to come back. I heard a muffled shout of WHAT? And then silence. Crap. I got up, scraping my plate. I opened the back door quietly, running out into the garden, which lead into the woods. All the pack houses seemed to. Maybe I could just stay there, in a tree or something and avoid the inevitable. "Bella?" Paul called from the door. "I can hear you." He stood there, tapping his foot. SHIT. I tried to scramble up the nearest tree, and ended up falling, and being caught by Paul. "Oh, hey there! I didn't notice… Um" I waited for him to shout, but instead he laughed. "Going for another walk eh? Sam was telling me all about your new athletic side." He smiled, still holding me in his arms. I spastically fell out of his arms, only just landing on my feet in shock. "Are you alright?" I asked. Maybe he was ill? "Yeah, of course. Let's walk." He took my hand, strolling at my pace easily. "So… how was your talk with Sam?" I asked cautiously. "Good. I got some advice on an issue I've been having… in the… pack." Ah. They'd been talking about me. "Okay…" This was weird. "You know, we don't do this enough. I'm sorry." He sighed. "Oh. Yeah, S'alright." I mumbled, still in shock. At some point we found the end of the street our house was on, and headed back. "It's nice spending time with you," He whispered. "I'd like to do this more often." He opened the front door for me, as we both went in. "I guess." I answered uncertainly. "Good night. I'll do the dishes." He went to kiss me goodnight, but stopped himself, giving me and awkward pat on the back instead. I went to my room and changed, not sure what had just happened. Jacob would piss himself when he heard about this. With that I fell asleep quickly. The next morning, Paul made breakfast, greeting me with a smile. "Good morning sunshine!" "Wha?" I groaned, rubbing my eyes. "I made pancakes." "Why?" "Because you do far too much." "Okay…" When Paul finally had another patrol, I hurried to Jake's eager to see what he made of this sudden change with Paul. "Hey Bells," He was sat on the couch reading wuthering heights. "What on earth are you reading?" I double checked what book it was. "A classic Bella. It's so…" "Horrible? I hate it. They don't really love each other if they can hurt each other the way they do." I shook my head. "I agree. But it's romantic anyway." He insisted. "You're funny Jake." "So… Did Sam catch you?" "Yeah… I think he called Paul and told him but…" "But?" "He suddenly started trying to be nice. He made breakfast." "What?" He let out a shocked laugh. It was well known that Paul didn't cook. "Yeah, he's weird. So… How's the car?" "It's getting there. Wanna see?" He asked excitedly. "Yeah." We headed to the garage as usual. AN: This is just an idea… What do you think? Please tell me what you think :) .
