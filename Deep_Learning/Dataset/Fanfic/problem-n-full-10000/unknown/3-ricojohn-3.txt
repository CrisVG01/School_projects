clothes to fill my whole wardrobe and a new pair of sneakers that actually fit my feet. "We'll, that wasn't so bad, was it?" My mom asked as we left. I shrugged. "I guess not." I said. "But I still want a new swim suit. So I can get back to racing." She nodded. "Don't worry." She said. "We'll get my little fish back in the water." I nodded and gave her a small smile. I was about to say something when I froze in shock. "â€¦Chase, don't you dare!" A voice in back of me shouted. "And why not?" Demanded a boy with brown hair and blue eyes. "Because I said so!" A blond headed girl with storm grey eyes responded as a native American looking girl joined the two of them. "Chase." I muttered under my breath. "What's wrong?" My mother asked. "She said Chase." I answered. "His last name is Chase." It was at this point that my arm started to feel like it was vibrating. My skin was tingling under the bandage. "Ah," I gasped under my breath and I clutched at my arm. "Persi," My mom said in a tone that made me think she was trying to contain her emotions. "You need to talk to him. Or the vibrating your feeling on your arm won't stop." I looked her in the eyes as she gave me a nod. 'This is gona suck.' I thought bitterly as I approached the brown haired boy. "Chase?" I called out. The boy and the blond girl both turned to face me. "Who are you?" The boy asked. "I'm Persi Jackson." I said. "My timer just went off." The boy's eyebrows went up in surprise and he turned to face the blond girl who was staring at me in shock. "You're Persephone Jackson?" She asked me. I nodded and her face flooded with relief. "It's nice to finally meet you." She said. "You better be nice to my sister." The brown haired boy warned. "Malcom," The blond cut in. "Be nice to her." Malcom frowned as the native American looking girl dragged him away. The blond girl then turned back to me. "Sorry about my brother." She said. "I tried to ditch him but with my timer about to go off he refused to leave me alone." Now I was the one who was surprised. "You're Chase?" I asked her. She frowned. "My names Annabeth." She said. "It should be on your tattoo." I rubbed the back of my neck awkwardly as her eyes flew down to my left arm. "Did you hurt your arm?" She asked. "No," I answered. "I, uh, was driving myself crazy looking at your last name and so I wrapped it in a bandage yesterday." She nodded. "Well I only turned twenty-one today." She said. "So you haven't seen my name yet?" I shook my head as she walked up to me and held out her hand expectantly. I held out my left arm as she unwrapped the bandage to reveal the numbers had disappeared and the name now read Annabeth Chase. As she reached out to touch the tattoo the vibrating in my arm stopped. "It's good to finally meet you." She said again. "I just really don't get it now." I said out loud. "Get what?" She asked me. "I was a guy three days ago when my change hit." I said. "I just don't know why I'm a girl." Annabeth frowned at me, her grey eyes seaming to analyze me. "That does seem strange." She said. "But I suppose we never will know for sure why, only that it did." I nodded. "Persi?" My mom called out as she approached us. "Is this the one?" I nodded. "Mom, this is Annabeth Chase." I said. "Annabeth, this is my mother, Sally Jackson." "It's nice to meet you, mam." Annabeth greeted. "Please, call me Sally." My mother said with a laugh as she stretched out an arm to shake Annabeth's hand. After the small talk ended Annabeth checked her watch and her face went pail. "I have to go." She said. "My dad's gona kill me." "Need a ride?" My mother asked. "No, it's fine." Annabeth answered. "My friend Piper has a car but I would like to get your phone number." She was looking at me expectantly so I got out my phone and pulled up the contacts so she could put her number in my phone. Once she did I sent her a text so she had mine. "I'll call you tomorrow." She promised and ran off to find her brother and friend. "Oh, you two are so cute together." My mother teased when she left. "Mom." I groaned. POV Change! POV: Annabeth "Where the hell have you been!" My father demanded. "Sorry." I began before Malcom could open his mouth. "It won't happen again." "Where were you?" He repeated. "Her timer went off." Malcom cut in. My dad's eyebrows went up in surprise. "Today?" He asked. I nodded and shot Malcom a glare. "Yah." I said. "She seems nice." "She?" My dad cut in. "So it's a girl?" I nodded as my dad continued to frown at me. "Why didn't you ever tell me?" He asked. "All those times I would talk to you about boys and warning you about dating." He shook his head. "You know you could have told me any time." "I wasn't sure myself." I said. "Plus with the tattoos I always figured that it would tell me anyway." My father nodded. "Well, get to bed." He said. "And I expect to meet this Persephone tomorrow." "Dad, I'm twenty-one." I said. "I think I'm a little old for bedtimes." "Not as long as your living under my roof." He said with a teasing grin. "I can't wait for collage to start back up," I sighed. "No more curfew in the dorms." With that I went up the stairs to my room. Today was a weird day.
