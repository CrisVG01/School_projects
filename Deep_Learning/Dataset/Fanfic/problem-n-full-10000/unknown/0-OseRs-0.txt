class?" he replied to her. "Okay, it is a plan then!" Hermione said, a smile returning to her face. "I definitely want to get another history book; you gave me the idea when you said learning about spell creation would help us with all of our classes. I think learning as much as we can about the history of the school and the world of magic as a whole would help a lot too don't you?" Hermione asked him enthusiastically. She definitely had a point with that. "I think you are right. The required book for the class was an introductory guide to a history of magic so maybe something on the history of Hogwarts then?" he proposed. "Sounds good to me! You pick one now since I picked the first book," Hermione told him. "Wellâ€¦ Honestly from listening to McGonagall in the car talk about all the different types of spells and magic there are I want to find something that will help us learn a lot of different spells to cast. Maybe we can find a book of basic spells or something," Marik responded. Like Hermione had said he really didn't know enough about magic or their subjects to know exactly what to look for or what he might be interested in. He did know one thing though, and that was that he wanted to learn to cast as many spells as he could. He figured a book that had a list of spells or at least mentioned a lot of spells would be a good place to start. Hermione agreed with him on that choice as well and they decided to find a history book and a book on basic spells first while they thought of what other two books they wanted. In the end, Hermione chose for them to also get a book on potions and he had decided that they should get a book on astronomy as well. Even though they were not taking the astronomy elective class Marik did not want to miss out on anything crucial or important if it turned out astronomy was a crucial class. Plus he did not want to fall behind any of the other first years who took the class. Hermione was ecstatic at this suggestion and completely agreed with his thought process. She even considered changing from getting a potions book to a divination book to do the same but after looking through the divination section they both agreed that they wanted to go with potions and avoid anything divination related. After they had found the four books they wanted they brought their books to the store's checkout counter where their parents were waiting along with Professor McGonagall. Altogether Marik was leaving the store with the required books for his classes, the two books he would be taking home first before trading with Hermione, plus technically the two books she was reading first. He glanced at the towering stack of his books on the counter looking at them in awe at all he was going to get to learn in the coming days. After the group had purchased all of their books Professor McGonagall led the party back through the Leaky Cauldron pub to the car that they had all ridden in earlier that morning. Along the way back home the ride was much quieter than previously, as both he and Hermione had already stuck their noses into one of the books they had just bought. When Marik and his family made it back home and said their goodbyes to Professor McGonagall he immediately made his way to the couch in the living room and started looking at all of his books, deciding on which order he wanted to read them in. He would be leaving for Hogwarts shortly on the first of September and wanted to make sure he knew everything he could before it started. He figured the kids who had magical parents would be years ahead of him already, so he had to make sure that he was caught up by the first day of classes, which meant that until he left for Hogwarts it was operation-no-sleep-only-read-and-take-notes for him. He stacked the books in the order he wanted to read them knowing he would not be able to finish them all but could at least start most of them. He decided on the following order: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1 by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling The Dark Arts, and How to Defend Against Them by Quentin Trimble A Spill of Spells by Asuna Modwip A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch An Introduction to Spell Creation by Fiona Findings The Magic of the Cosmos by Carl Sagan One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Proud of his pile books and anxious to start diving into them he picked up the Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1, which he had already started reading in the car on the way home, and began to learn all he could about his amazing new world of magic. Author's Chapter End Note: Because one, avid, fan of the series stopped reading here and decided to send me a very, insightful, message about how dumb I was for renaming Harry Potter, Marik Ose and making him an adopted American boy I thought I would clarify something: Marik is not Harry Potter lol.
