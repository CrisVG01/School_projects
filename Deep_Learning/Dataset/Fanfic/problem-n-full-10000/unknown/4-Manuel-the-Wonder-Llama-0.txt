sir," Jasper started, "is it wise to make such a conclusion before hearing all reports?" "Whitlock, I've got enough information to declare it the victory that it is," he replied confidently. "If I may speak more freely, sir…" Jasper trailed off waiting for a response, which he got in the form of a slight nod, as the general motioned the captain off. "General, I've got some reports from our officers, and two letters here, but I'm hearing some disturbing information being passed around the canteen." He paused; although he had been given permission to speak freely, he knew that he must weigh his words carefully. "Sir, there are reports of General Buell arriving with reinforcements, and he'd have easy access across the landing." "BUELL?" proclaimed Beauregard, "Buell's no where near here!" He started looking through papers that scattered the table he was using. "He's off for Decatur, Alabama," he held up a piece of paper and looking particularly happy about this news. "Helm just reported that Buell's heading east. I'm not going to waste my time chasing ghosts." "Of course not sir, but what if it's true? Shouldn't we prepare?" "There's no need. I've got Grant right where I want him. He's pinned down by the river. Tomorrow, we'll finish this," he said confidently. "Some of the men, off the record… well… that is to say, I overheard some of the men asking why we didn't just finish them off tonight, before they could get any reinforcements or supplies tonight." "Whitlock, is this the first time you've seen action?" his voice changed. Although Jasper was worried about offending the General, it seemed to have become more fatherly than annoyed. "In point of fact, yes sir, it is." "I've seen it far more than I care to. From as far back as '47 at Contreras in the Mexican War. It's an awful sight." He paused in an almost reminiscent fashion before speaking more quickly, "Grant's barrage of artillery was getting rather formidable there at the end. It's not too much, but more than we could handle after fighting for 12 hours. If I didn't call it off, we would have been cut down like trees before dynamite." "Sir, my count gives us 20,000 strong available to fight…" he was cut off. "…And that's more than we would have if we kept pushing Grant. Right now that's more than we need to whip 'em in the morning." For the first time in their few weeks of working together, Jasper was unsatisfied with their ability to work together. He was truly disappointed with how his boss could simply disregard these concerns. Yet, this was the same P.G.T. Beauregard who had managed to take Fort Sumter without losing a single soldier in battle. Clearly his experience gave him benefit of any doubt. Moreover, the Major knew his place, and it was not over a general. "So are we prepared for tomorrow?" "Very nearly. I shall have you deliver orders soon enough," Beauregard replied. "By your leave if I may, sir." The major was still somewhat frustrated. "Certainly Whitlock. Get a drink and return within the half hour." "I am obliged, sir." Jasper wasted no time extracting himself from that table or from that room. His frustrations with battle were many. There were the many unanswered questions, the second-guessing of junior officers, having to defend each individual decision. Then there was even his concern over the impending telegram to Jefferson Davis declaring total victory. He needed a few moments to breathe. A few minutes in the air outside were all that he needed, although a walk would help, too. The sun had set and the cool spring night had settled upon the Tennessee countryside. The night was clear and would be chilled by morning. He stepped further into the clearing, away from the church, so that he could enjoy the stars, but he was careful to remain within earshot, in case he was called for. …and then it hit him. Earshot. That is what was wrong with the after action reports. He could still hear mortars firing occasionally, but that sound was secondary to the main concern he had. He could hear the moaning and wailing of the wounded. It was not just coming from the hospital, or the ambulances. Instead it was coming from everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. He wanted to identify the source, but as he moved north toward the battlefield, the sounds simply continued getting louder, from all around. Twenty thousand men, he thought. If we have only twenty thousand men… that means that we have approximately 5,000 men dead, wounded, or missing. Of course, if some of these men are dead, how many are wounded and left wanting for help? If that's the damage to our side, how many more must there be from the Union… He slowly drew ever closer to the fields. Jasper was once again experiencing something new, something he had never noticed before: compassion. He felt sorry for all those who were suffering. He drew some comfort in knowing that he was not responsible for any of the suffering. Those men that he killed died quickly. At least three died before they even knew what happened. Looking back on it, he was surprised to see how calm and collected he felt there in the thick of the fight. It was standing on the sidelines delivering orders that made him more uncomfortable. The great irony is that it was this highly coveted "safe assignment" that made him feel more out of place than being on the front lines. Jasper Whitlock was coming to realize that his role as adjutant, although honorable, was not where his natural abilities lie. He finally saw himself for what he is. The world of messages and personal duties took away his talents. Instead he was fulfilling orders rather than being what he was meant to be: a man of action. Little did he know, that his time for taking action would soon arrive.
