you for your praise, little prince." *Little prince!*, Legolas thought wrathfully, behind the sweet expression on his face. *Elbereth, don't tell me I'm going to be babied here, as well! Ugh!* The Queen was speaking now,"Legolas, of course, will only be entering the archery end of the tournament." "Oh?", Glorfindel said, eyebrows lifting. He was aware of Legolas's skill as an archer, but had expected the youth to be entering more than just one segment of the tournament, as all other participants were going to do. "Ah, yes", King Thranduil said,"We'd prefer this, actually. For his own safety, you see. Our only son... why, we couldn't bare it if he were hurt in any way." "I understand." Glorfindel nodded. Legolas rolled his eyes, a small gesture of annoyance that only Glorfindel didn't fail to notice. *But maybe the Prince would have it otherwise*, Glorfindel noted privately as continued conversing with the King and Queen of Mirkwood. Forgotten for the moment, Legolas leaned back on the bed thinking about all the elves that had been staring at him earlier. He wondered how he would ever fit in with any of them when and if they all began to make fun of him for the whole carriage incident. He hoped that no one would remember him as the elf that had to be carried like baby to his first tournament. ~---------------~------------------~---------------~ A little earlier, back down in the welcoming yard: ~---------------~------------------~---------------~ Aragorn, having been already set up in a room with his twin brothers the day before, had been helping to unload luggage from various other elves' horses when the little carriage had driven up. He gave the thing a strange look as it came lumbering up the road, slightly amused that someone attending the tournament would be so ... *delicate* as to need one. Shrugging and setting down the box he'd just unstrapped from a horse, Aragorn decided that the carriage was probably carrying someone's pregnant mother. So you can imagine his surprise when, instead of a small elf woman with a great big belly being helped out of the buggy, a slender elf, with long shining locks of blonde hair, leaped lightly out without any sort of assistance. Surprise, however, was quickly replaced with wonder as he gazed at the carriage-riding elf a little closer. Crimson lips, a perfect pout, glowing and flawless skin, with the most innocently teasing cerulean-blue eyes... *......*, Aragorn's mind went blank. He could only gawk, speechless, as some of the others were, at the figure that stood gazing around almost indifferently, the pale cheeks of the elf coloring up in a pretty flush, probably because of the cool breeze. Feeling himself drift lazily into a reverie, Aragorn shook his head and blinked his eyes. The elf from the carriage was being draped in a large, thick shapeless cloak by a woman wearing a crown. A crown. Not just nobility, then... the elf was royalty. Having no choice in the matter, for Aragorn's heart had just won control over his bodily movements, the dark haired Rivendell boy was forced to stare at the elf, completely enraptured, as he was lead away by the crowned woman around a corner and out of his sight. *What an interesting tournament this will be*, Aragorn thought. ~-----------------~----------------~ Back to Legolas's turmoil... ~-----------------~----------------~ "... And make sure you draw the drapes in the evenings", The King of Mirkwood was saying,"You don't want it to become too cold in here, you may get sick." "Elves don't *get* sick, Father, you know that." The King paused,"Er... Right. Anyway - If you have any questions go directly to Glorfindel. He will be happy to assist you." Glorfindel had respectfully left the room a little while ago, leaving the royal family to say their Goodbye's. "And there are messages that can come quickly to us, if it is your parents that you need", the Queen added lovingly, cupping Legolas's face in her hands and rubbing her nose to his. "My baby!" The Prince silently thanked Elbereth that they were still within the privacy his room and that no one else was present. As soon as the Queen released him, King Thranduil swooped in to embrace his son, lightly crushing the slight boy in his fatherly affection. "Well... We'll see you at the end of the tournament, then, son", the King said gravely, letting Legolas loose. Thranduil's great, old eyes teared up and his bottom lip trembled before it disappeared beneath the upper one; his wife was in a similar condition, her sniffeling barely audible. Legolas smiled reassuringly,"I'll be fine. You don't have to worry." His parents nodded, straightening up. "Of course," Thranduil said gruffly, and gently taking his wife's hand."I know you'll behave yourself. Goodbye, son." "Farewell, father, mother...", Legolas said, ushering his parents out the door. They moved robotically outside and stood to face him,"Have a good trip!" They nodded, wordlessly, and began walking slowly away. Legolas shook his head and shut the door. *At last*, he thought.*Alone! At last!!* Grinning from pointed-ear to pointed-ear, Legolas leaped onto his bed and bounced up and down happily before settling back against his pillows. Despite his worrying about what the other elves would think of him being babied in a carriage all the way to a battle-skill tournament, he couldn't help but feel a little better because of his new-found freedom. There were still a few hours before having to go down and join the welcoming feast, so Legolas decided to catch up on the snoozing he had been cashing in on before being so rudely interrupted. So - sighing and burying his head within the feathery comforts of the bed, the Prince of Mirkwood fell peacefully under the foggy spell of sleep... ********************************************************************* To be continued...
