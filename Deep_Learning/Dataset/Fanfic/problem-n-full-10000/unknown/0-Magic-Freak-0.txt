himself. Draco Malfoy now owned jeans. Harry and Hermione thought it was hilarious. When the three weren't pulling pranks and having fun they were in the library studying and learning new things about anything and everything. However no matter how much they asked Harry would not tell them how he had been injured; even Tom could not get it out of them, who joined them for dinner each night. Harry was dreading tonight; it would be his first meeting as death eater. "Harry you will be fine" Draco smiled at Harry "Honestly I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be brave" Harry rolled his eyes at his blonde friend. "The sorting hat tried to sort me in Slytherin" Harry replied and soon laughed at the look Draco was giving him. "You talked the hat out of a sorting? That's impossible it's never been done." Harry shrugged "Actually I showed strong attributes for all the houses, so I could have been placed anywhere." Draco's mouth was once again agape "Flies, Draco flies". Draco closed his mouth only to open it again. "You seem to make the impossible happen Harry; you would have to be of all the founders blood to have done that." Harry stared at Draco, he had never thought about that, until now. "I can apparate on Hogwarts grounds" Draco smiled at Harry "you're keyed into the wards". They sat there in silence, Harry and Draco could do this without it being awkward. Harry had a stronger bond that Harry and Ron were never close to getting. "Drake I'm sorry for not accepting your friendship back at Hogwarts" Draco laughed " I'll forgive you if you be my pillow for a little while" Harry was frozen in shock, he nodded at Draco he placed his head in his lap and quickly fell asleep. Harry hadn't noticed the bags under Draco's eyes until now, he felt horrible that he hadn't noticed sooner. He declared to himself he wouldn't move and would allow for Draco to sleep for as long as needed. He ran a hand through Draco's hair absentmindedly. His hair was soft as silk and ran through his fingers like water. He smiled as Draco smiled in his sleep; it was like his small gesture of comfort drifted into his friends sleep. He sat there reading for hours, he could see other blokes being uncomfortable but he had told Draco that he was gay weeks ago, when he told him he was scared he was going to lose his new friend but Draco had laughed and said he could tell because he was too. This had made Harry nervous was he really that obvious that he was gay. Tom and Draco had known come to think of it when he outed himself to Hermione she had said the same thing. He told Draco that he had told the dark lord he wasn't gay and Draco laughed "I bet he saw right through you". Harry smiled at the memory he felt Draco stir as he lifted his head from Harry's lap he had sleep lines down his face. Harry laughed at Draco who tried to glare but failed. "Thanks harry I needed that" Harry then hugged his best friend with a laugh "I'm here if you need me Drake" Draco leaned into the hug "I'm fine, just didn't get much sleep." Harry released him from the hug and nodded, he knew there was more to it than that but trusted Draco to tell him when he was ready, Hermione came into the room "It's time, Harry get your mask on." Draco quickly sorted out his appearance while Harry put on his mask; they walked down the hall hand in hand, both trying to show they would follow Harry to the end of the earth. The walk to Tom's meeting point was a long one drawn out by silence. When they arrived Hermione and Draco went and joined there spot in the meeting and Harry stood next to Tom like he was told he had to do. He had the eyes of a hundred death eaters giving him daggers as he stood there with his head held high like Draco taught him. He acted as if the people in front of him were nothing. When he found Hermione and Draco he focused on them. He didn't really hear the meeting, just kept himself focused on his two friends, trying not to show how scared he was to be there. Tom put his hand on Harry's shoulder "This young man here is my newest recruit" whispers could be heard but were quickly silenced by Tom's glare. "Reveal yourself" Harry slowly lifted the mask from his face. His hand shaking as he dropped it to give everyone a look at his face. There was gasps and then silence, no one dared to speak... They were in shock." Harry Potter is to be my equal and will not bare my mark as he already wears one". Harry stood in shock he hadn't expected that. "If any harm is laid onto Harry from anyone you will die by my hand... Any objections?" If there was no one dare to move anyway. Harry smirked "I look forward to working with you; I have a feeling I'm going to have a lot of fun here" He gestured to Hermione and Draco to join them. "My lord can I have them as my most trusted". Tom nodded "Come on Mione, Drake.. We have evil plotting to do" Dragging the two surprised teenagers behind him. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ There evil plotting turned out I be just enjoying Harry's cooking once again. Harry smiled at his friends, Harry already had a plan. I hope you enjoyed my story so far, this story just wouldn't leave my head until I wrote it down..
