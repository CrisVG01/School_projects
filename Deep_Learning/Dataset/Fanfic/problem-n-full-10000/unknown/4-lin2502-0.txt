Mike shot up ready to hit me "you've got to be kidding Mike" I said He swung his fist round and I caught it shaking my head I pushed him back and he was on his backside again "give it up Mike" Tyler said laughing "you know Bella's not interested". I lifted Bella over the bench and Mike I turned round and looked at him shaking my head as we walked to the other tables further down We sat opposite each other "this is different" she said "Bella I need you to trust me and I need you to come with me" "why" she asked puzzled, I leaned further towards her being this near to her was painful not only because I loved her so much and she didn't know what I was, but her scent burned my throat every time I took a breath "just trust me please I'll explain when I get you away from here" " does that mean you'll tell me every thing" "I'll bargain with you" I said smiling "you ask questions I'll answer but first I want you to ask Jessica if she'll tell a little fib for you" "What why" "please Bella" "ok ok…. JESSICA" it didn't take Jessica long to come over to us "what Bella …hi Edward" "Hi Jes will you do Bella and myself a favour please" I asked looking her straight in the eyes she swayed a bit then leaned on the table I smiled at her "sure what" "Will you tell Charlie that Bella's staying at your house tonight and she'll be home on Sunday and don't tell the others especially Mike and Lauren" She looked at Bella to see if it was ok with her, Bella nodded "I will if you answer a question", she said with a smirk, "Bella's not been going out lately so I was wondering if you two have been secretly dating", she stood waiting for an answer I looked at Bella, how the hell do I answer this and as she was the only one I couldn't read which was getting really inconvenient, I look straight in her eyes to see if I could get a reaction …nothing…. Nada …very frustrating. "Hi Dr Cullen" Jessica shouted then looked at us to see if we'd got into trouble as far as she knew Carlisle was my father "Edward, Bella" he said as he walked over to us "hello Jessica how are you" "great doc" she said smiling I held my hand out and Carlisle dropped the car keys into it I was expecting the keys to my Volvo I looked up at him he'd given me the keys to his Mercedes he threw 2 credit cards on the table and said "go now I'll handle this" Jessica's eyes opened wide when she looked at the cards one my bank card and the other a platinum no limit credit card. "well" I said "ok" she said with a smile on her face "a secret" I repeated she nodded started to walk away then turned quickly "hey you two answer please " we looked at each other and said together "yes" "I knew it I knew it" she said walking away We walked towards the car park Bella turned round suddenly and went the other way "where are you going" I said catching her arm "I left my scarf and gloves" "I'll buy you some more Bella come on" I spun her round and she was about 2 inch from me I put my arms round her and held her, holding her with one arm I lifted her face with the other and kissed her fore head moving down I kissed the corner of her mouth then the kiss went deeper her arms went round my neck and I pulled back "careful baby I'll explain later" "but you smell so good" she said "and I'll explain that later as well" I said laughing But I knew she would be fairly safe now she had my scent on her and that was a no no for another one of our kind to touch her trouble is it only went one way I saw Alice jumping up and down clapping my family knew what it meant if none of the others did the 3 strangers seems to have no idea of the rules. Jasper leaned over to the 3 "do you know what that means" he said quietly they all shook their heads Emmett tutted he was really enjoying this, Carlisle was sat across from them now he leaned forward "it means she belongs to him as his mate and if anyone else of our kind touch her they answer to the rest of the coven don't you know any of the rules who the hell changed you and left you to cause havoc", They would have to learn quick or the Italians would descend on them, it made me wonder how they'd stayed alive or dead which ever way you look at it for so long. "This is your dads car" I nodded opening the car door "where are we going" and she turned round looking frightened "you'll be fine Bella I won't hurt you" she was leaning on the car her back to the open door I put one hand on each side of her I leaned in and kissed her breathing out and instant calm all these predator weapons were good for something I kissed her again deeper this time and ran my tongue along her bottom lip. I got a sudden pain that ripped through my head like elastic that's been stretched way past its limit then snapping back I pulled back and put my head down, "Edward are you ok" she said and all my families eyes shot up to me "Edward" I heard Alice whisper. "I'm fine I answered not knowing if I was or not the mobile in my pocket started to buzz "Carlisle I'm ok I'll ring you later"
