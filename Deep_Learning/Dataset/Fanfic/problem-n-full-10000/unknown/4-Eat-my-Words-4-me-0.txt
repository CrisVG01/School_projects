young cub. But the look on Embry's face was worth every cent. He pulled away from the nurse and raced towards Carlisle. Breaking from the circle Carlisle picked the little boy up in his arms. "Go with the nurse and do as you're told." he said firmly. Embry's little chin began to wrinkle and waters pooled in his eyes. It broke Carlisle heart to have to tell his little one off but he needed to keep him safe. As the nurse came to take him Carlisle slipped a piece of candy into Embry's hand and winked at him. "Ever want to sell him Carlisle give me a call." Victoria said from the other side of the room. The room erupted into peals of laughter. "I will keep that in mind." he chuckled. That was close any of the vampires could have attacked the child. He had just spent nearly one hundred million dollars on three young children. The buyers had thinned out and only about one hundred were left after the alpha's and beta's were sold. The last one to be auctioned was young Seth. Jane and Alec walked beside the nurse into the center of the circle. The guards were ready to attack anyone who moved an inch. Carlisle risked a looked at Marcus who seemed bored with the whole auction. He had to give it to the man he hadn't moved and showed just as much disinterest as before. "Ladies and gentleman this is our last sale of the day. He comes from good stock and will make a great addition to any coven. Shall we start the bidding at fourteen million?" Aro asked. "Here" someone called. And so the bidding began. Carlisle kept quiet and watched as the bids begun to climb. "Have I got any more on twenty million?" Aro asked seeming disappointed the boy was not selling for higher. The room was silent. Marcus still hadn't moved but his eyes never left the baby. "Well it would seem that he is not that special." Aro chuckled. "Twenty one." Carlisle shouted. "Twenty three." Twenty four." "Twenty five." "Twenty six." Carlisle said. "Eighty million dollars. Lets stop mucking around. We all know that he wants the baby. It means that it has something special someone called out. Marcus sat up straight and leaned forward. Young Seth had started crying and the nurse could not quieten him. "Really James do you honestly think we don't know how much money you possess Caius chuckled. "As long as I come up with the money he will be mine." James hissed. "Take him away he is wasting our time." Marcus said leaning back and waving his hand as though bored. Aro turned to his brother before back to his audience. "Ladies and gentleman the last bid was eighty million dollars. If we don't have any further bids the child will be disposed of." "Eighty one million dollars." Carlisle said going forward. "Very well it would seem that my dear brother Carlisle has a need to take on mutts." "Please won't you join us for a feast being brought in for us all." Aro said not giving a backwards glance as Carlisle took the young boy from the nurse's arm. "We will escort you back to the rooms." Alec said kindly. He smiled down at young Seth who was now happy sucking on Carlisle's finger. With a nod they were led down to the nursery. Once there the nurse took Seth from him as the other children raced to greet him. "Are you our new father now?" Quil asked. "I am." Carlisle said picking him up. "Yay!" Jacob and Quil shouted. Embry stood back and looked at his feet. Carlisle put Quil down and went to the young boy. "Embry aren't you happy to be coming home with me?" "Yes sir." he smiled at him and threw his arms around his neck. "Let's go pack our bag." Quil said. "We don't have a bag." Jacob said pushing Quil to the ground. "Boys no pushing or shouting. You need to stay here a few more days until things are sorted out between the adults. But I promise to visit you everyday and tell you something's about your new family." Carlisle promised. "But it's boring in here. I want to go outside and play I haven't seen the sun in a long time." Jacob pouted. "Well it's raining out so no playing outside. There will be plenty of time to play outside when we get home. Now I can smell your dinner. Go wash up and get ready while I talk to nurse Lily." Carlisle said rubbing Embry's hair. "Come on race you!" Jacob called as the boys made a dash to the bathroom. "I take it you know what we are?" Carlisle asked the nurse. "Yes. Although not when I first applied for the job. If I had known why I was being offered so much money I wouldn't have accepted it. Will I make it out of here alive?" she whispered. "I will speak to the leaders. I will need help with the boys to get them back home. Even with my speed I think these four are going to be a handful. Once we arrive safely back in the states I will let you go. I suggest you don't' return to Italy however." "Thank you Doctor." she said pulling Seth closer to her chest. "Lily the boys are going to be loved. I am not like most vampires. I have never tasted human blood and as you know I am a doctor. All I ask of you is that you don't breathe a word of this to anyone. If you do I cannot take responsibility for your safety." "Of course doctor." "Quil didn't wash his hands with soap." Jacob called out. "I will leave you to it. I have to go make arrangements to get the children home. I will return for their bedtime story." Carlisle smiled going to the door.
