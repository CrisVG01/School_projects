and his car keys on her desk. "Katniss, you need to tell him." Madge says softly, rubbing Katniss' shoulder consolingly. "Tell me what?" Peeta asks. "Brainless, come on." Johanna whispers. That's right, Jo. Kind but with the usual edge of meanness. Katniss thinks to herself. "Can someone please tell me what's happened?" Peeta asks, louder this time. "Don't be an ass!" Gale shouts. Katniss is so glad her Mom's gone to get Prim. "How the hell could you not know what's happened?" "Gale, don't." Katniss whimpers. And the Oscar goes to... "Why shouldn't I?" Gale growls. "He's fucked up. Either you tell him or I will!" Katniss forces herself to look up. She catches sight of herself in the mirror in the corner of the room. Christ. She looks like shit. But it's Peeta's face that breaks her heart. He looks petrified. "Gale!" Madge hisses. Katniss breaks out into tears. "Look what you've done to her!" Gale yells, stepping forward and shoving Peeta. "You're such a twat! She's sixteen !" "What's happened?" Peeta cries, stumbling slightly, obviously taken back by Gale's anger. Katniss continues to sob. Madge murmurs into her ear. "Katniss, baby, tell me." Peeta continues with wide eyes, stepping forward. Gale yanks him back, shoving him against the wall, holding him up by the scruff of his neck. "Don't you fucking touch her!" He spits. Johanna steps in, pulling Gale away. Peeta straightens his collar, looking at Gale in surprise. "Stop it! Christ, Gale! You're making it worse!" She hisses. Peeta walks over to Katniss, and crouches down in front of her. Katniss dabs at her 'tears'. "Hey, come on. You can tell me anything." Peeta says, resting his hand on her knee. "Katniss, you have to." Madge reminds her. "Why are these guys here?" Peeta asks gently. "I called them. For support." Katniss chokes out. "Why, what's wrong?" "You love me, right?" Katniss asks, peeking up over her knees. Cripes, this tear stuff is great. "Of course I do." Peeta says, his lips turned down into a frown. "No matter what?" "No matter what, you know that," Peeta promises. "I love you Katniss. Please tell me. You're scaring me." "I felt weird... during the night..." Katniss starts, playing up the hiccoughing stage of crying. "You know, when my phone rang?" "Yeah, it was your Mom." "'Cuz I texted her, before you came over, and she didn't get to reply until then because of her shifts." "And?" Peeta prompts. "What was it? No one's died, have they?" "N-no. It's not that. I told Mom that I felt funny. She said that there was a stomach bug going around, and that maybe I had got it, but I knew that it wasn't an illness..." She trails of, taking a deep shaky breath. Madge passes her tissue. "And I missed my period..." She exhales slowly. "So I took a pregnancy test." Peeta is stunned into silence for a minute or two, his brain processing the information. "What did it say?" He asks quietly. "P-positive!" Katniss says. "Are you sure?" Peeta asks, sinking back onto his heels. "The test was a hospital grade one, Peeta," Madge says, pulling out the test Annie peed on. "It's most likely correct." Peeta takes the test and stares at it. His face pales. "I'm so s-sorry!" Katniss croaks, hiding her face in her hands. "This is his fault, Catnip. Not yours." Gale interjects. "Shut up, Gale." Johanna cuts him off. "I didn't think this would happen!" Katniss sobs. "B-but you're on the pill," Peeta says. "How could this happen?" "It must h-have been before I s-started taking it." "What about condoms? We used them." "It m-must have broken. I-I don't know!" "Hey, don't cry," Peeta soothes, sitting beside Katniss and pulling her into a hug. She buries her face in his chest. "Take another test, just be sure. Maybe it's a fluke." "I don't t-think it is!" "But... but we're only sixteen. I can't be a father," Peeta says, obviously trying his best to stay calm. "Do you want to get rid of it? Or are you gonna keep it?" "I c-can't get r-rid of it. N-no. I c-can't." Katniss lets out another pained sob. "Okay, okay. That's okay. Calm down," Peeta says, rubbing her back in circles. "Don't cry. We'll sort this out." "M-mom doesn't even k-know yet," Katniss reveals. "I didn't w-want to w-worry her 'cuz work at t-the hospital is stressful." "Do only these guys know?" "Yeah," Katniss says. Peeta is silent. "Are you mad?" "Katniss," Peeta says, pulling away and holding her shoulders. "Why would I be angry? Accidents happen. Look at Rye. He got his girlfriend pregnant, and they're alright." "Lead by fucking example, you dickhead." Gale mutters. "We'll be okay. Don't cry," Peeta says, wiping Katniss' tears away with the pad of his thumb. "I'll get another job. I'll sell my Xbox." Sell his Xbox? Hell no. "Katniss, it'll be okay. Peeta is a good guy." Madge says. "It is Peeta's, right?" Johanna says warily. "Of course it is!" Katniss exclaims. "Calm down, calm down," Peeta says, smiling sadly at Katniss. She can't imagine how he must be feeling. Terrified of what being a father means. Terrified of what his mother will do. "Let me get my head straight." Katniss bites her lip and glances up at Johanna, who gives her a look that she translates a: 'Oh go on then. Give it up. He looks like he's about to die.' "P-Peeta?" She asks, looking up at him. "Yeah?" "There's one other thing." Katniss says, scrunching the tissue Madge gave her in her palm. "Christ, what is it?" Peeta asks. Katniss so desperately wants to kiss him to death right now. He looks so terrified, but despite the situation, he's stayed wonderfully calm. And she didn't think she could love him any more than she already did. She takes a deep breath. Madge squeezes her shoulder. Johanna grins. Gale smirks. Peeta panics just a little bit more. "APRIL FOOLS!"
