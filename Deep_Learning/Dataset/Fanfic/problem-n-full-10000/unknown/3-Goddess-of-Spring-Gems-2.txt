was. A lot of laughs sounded at that. Zeus glared at all of them, so did Hercules. "Sorry, I usually don't blank out." Hades said. "Oops?" I gave him a sheepish smile. "You can smile?" Hebe sounded so incredulous, Thalia had to laugh. "Yes, yes I can." Hades said. I realized the damage I had done. I just attacked Zeus in his own domain. "Yes, that is a really bad idea." Poseidon commented. "Ya think?" Hades asked. I walked back to my seat, stealing a glance at the others. What really hurt me, though was that Hestia was smirking. Really. SMIRKING. After all that I had done to help her fit in and get along with everyone. She just left me alone. "That isn't nice." Annabeth frowned. Hestia hung her head a bit. "Hypocrite." Hades muttered. J ust like Kronos. A voice told me. "You helped Kronos?" Zeus glared at him. "He used to be nice..." Hades retaliated, his voice softening in the end. "She isn't Kronos!" I growled softly, slamming my hand on the ground. And looked up. 'Strike two.' I thought. One more strike and I had to run for my life. That was another thing. I was the only one with the strike rule. "That isn't fair!" Hazel protested. "Yeah! You should know better, dad." Persephone added, smiling at Hazel who smiled back. I caught Hestia's attention. "Why?" Percy and Leo asked. "Stop smirking, or it'll ruin your reputation!" I mouthed. "Why are you trying to help her?" Ares asked, rudely. "Be nice to your aunt!" Hades mimicked Hera. Hera frowned at him, while everyone else cracked up. Hestia stared at me before wiping the smirk off, turning around and huffing. The other gods stared at the two of us. I stared at them until I realized something was off. "Oh shiz, strike three. They think I upset Hestia." I muttered. "You don't curse?" Demeter asked. "Not really." Hades murmured, upset that even his siblings forgot him. "Hey," Persephone nudged him. "it's fine, it might be better after we finish the book!" She reassured him. He gave her a tight smile. I gave them one last glare before racing out of there. How could Hesta be so... cruel? "I'm not cruel!" Hestia protested weakly. "Oh really? Then why did you become a hypocrite and turn against me when I brought you closer to the family?" Hades said to her younger sister. I get that it was her old character, but still. She used to be so nice to me. A few millennia ago. Besides, I didn't have much loving children that understood what it was like to be neglected. "Poor Hades." Hera mocked. "Is the stress too much to handle?" "Yes. It is." Hades said, glaring at her. "Maybe she IS like Kronos after all!" I yelled, punching a wall in frustration. And accidently breaking it. The passing gods stared at me, and then rushed off. No doubt they will tell Zeus about my 'Kronos like abilities that might dethrone you!' "You're THAT strong?" Frank asked. "Maybe." Unlike the other gods, Hades didn't seem to like power. Racing off, I realized something. One, I hadn't been caught destroying anything for a long time. Two, it meant that I was really pissed off. Yikes. Last time it happened, I destroyed half of the Underworld. "That. Is. Creepy. Cool." Leo said, putting together a small horse. Backing away from the wall, I shadow-travelled over to a garden. It's not like anyone's going to remember that I used to radiate life anytime soon. "You used to radiate life?" Demeter stared at her brother. "Can you stop forgetting my past self?" Hades yelled, in frustration. "No." Artemis said. "Males." "Well you try being put under so much stress!" Hades grabbed a bow out. "You should control your anger." A voice called, about twenty feet away from me. "Who is that?" Poseidon asked his brother. "Not telling." Hades said. "Read on." "We need to go somewhere else to read." Athena reminded them. "The chapter's over." Hades breathed a sigh of relief. "There still are a lot of chapters to read left, though." Athena burst his bubble. Everyone stood up, and realized something. "Where is Octavian?" Reyna asked. "No idea." Hades replied. Everyone turned to Apollo. "I think that he's in the forest though." Hades added. Walking towards the forest, the demigods burst into chatter. With their ADHD it had been hard to it still. "What do you think the monsters are doing?" Malcolm asked Annabeth. "The monsters have been paused for now. They unfreeze when we finish the books." Hades answered for her. At the questioning and accusing looks, he sighed. "Will you ever start treating me like one of you? Or the way you treat my advisors?" He asked. "NOPE!" Everyone else yelled. Hades stared at all of them and walked ahead at a fast pace, into the dark, dark forest. "Now what are we going to do?" Persephone groaned as they lost sight of him. "You angered him." Nico muttered, glaring at his stepmother, as Thalia told him to stop acting like a young child. "You upset him." Hazel countered. "I didn't mean it that way!" Persephone yelled. "Seriously, Hecate and Thanatos are my friends. Hades is my husband." All of them stared at the forest, dark and imposing. "The forest reminds me of Hades, dark and imposing." Percy blurted out. The others stared at him and laughed at his statement. Author's note: Did you like the first chapter? 4,144 without THIS author's note. I just had to write this. Sorry if you thought it was short. And I really like writing about Hades, if you noticed. I like to paint him in a good light. The part of Hades having a different method of demigod children is for all my stories right now. And the Minthe and Leuce parts are true too. ~Goddess of Sea-Wisdom Aka. The girl that wants to change her penname to 'SpringGem' but isn't sure.
