the long nights which followed. A light which didn't judge his tears no matter how long they soaked on for. A child from any background had the undeniable property of truth and, on that day, Sirius realised that if his heart was to go on, it was to go on in her - his daughter. She was, after all, his truth. And to him there was no greater truth than love. Trauma had ripped from him so much but he refused to allow it further. It had been enough to drive him behind the walls of calculation and the cold machine of a rationality but Sirius had tasted love and he was certain that he would protect the last hope he had of keeping it. No matter what the cost. Tragedy would drive them no further. But in order to do that, he would have to be the one to drive them further apart. It was later that he learned of magic. And later that he learned of his fate. The fate which would surely become hers. X-X-X "Mr. Prince, sir. Could I- Oh." The dark-haired secretary walked in through the polished tan of the door and glanced around. "Sorry, I thought you had company. I could have sworn I heard you talking." Sirius turned around, his weighty torso leaning back against the glass to which he had been whimsically murmuring only moments before. "And I thought we had an impostor in our midst. Here I was wondering 'since when has Tom ever been this formal when we're alone?' So I suppose that makes both of us a little foolish." The slicked strands which had fallen to hang heavily over his nose lifted with the man's slight huff of air. "What can I do for you, Tom?" The long-serving assistant approached gradually and prefaced his enquiry with, "You know I don't like to intervene and I hope you know that my comments are never a question of your judgement," the slight slap of a leather album on his boss' desk, "but I do feel obliged to ask: are you sure , Sirius? It's been so long." A measured stride walked to bridge the distance. Empire burgundy swirled around the crystal rim seated at the edge of the corporate emperor's hand. "How long have you known me for, Tom?" "What most people would say was too long." Sirius smiled with humour. "Then you'll know how impossible it was for me to say yes when I sent her away." Tom nodded. Sirius took a deep, slightly inebriated breath and uttered, "And whilst a great many things will face her - many troubles and dangers and threats beyond even my comprehension, I cannot begin to describe how selfishly happy I am to say yes this time. To have her back." "Do you think she can handle it?" "If the fate that awaits her is heavy because she's my daughter, then I know that, no matter what, she'll be able to handle it - because she's also Andie's." "When should I inform the young man who's been with her about the change of plan?" Sirius smiled with enjoyment and tilted his head to his dear friend. "Not until the plane lands. Let it be a surprise for them both - but mainly for her. She's been waiting so long, you're right, and events are finally coming to a head. I have reached the greatest position I could in the time I had and I've laid down as many tracks as possible to guide her on her way. Now all that's left is for her start following the path she must take. I'll give her as much to be free as I can but soon she will have to learn that with her freedom will come her fate, but also that with her fate will come her freedom." A smile. "Of course, Sirius, of course." X-X-X A world away, the cackling ferocity of a mad genius let loose echoed up the stairwell. The duality of a man so powerful was intense and persistent, so much so that his own brother often couldn't recognise the boy he had grown up with below the layers of corrupt age and fanciful desires. Rule the world? Destroy the filthy purebloods? Vengeance could have been so sweet if only Aberforth had not spent so long in the company of the man who had the power to make it happen. The white beard of a dreadful tyrant sploshed into the cauldron of his potent plotting and the old coot swung around, happy on the buzz of dull alcohol, to splodge a sloppy kiss on his only family's face. The twinkling eyes captured by alien photos and the innocently wise charm of an aged master reverberated only as far as superficiality would penetrate. Beneath lay only the depression of horrifying reality. Aberforth knew his fate, and it wasn't death. It was the only thing he could do, because this insane swarm of darkness was his only family. He couldn't rule the whole world and he couldn't protect it all either. But he could be the martyr who sacrificed the security of familial love for the suppression of a most horrifying future. There were people who could act - like him. And no matter how small their actions were, they would total up, and by the time the greatest concoction the world had ever seen is ready to be born, there would be an army of youth to overpower the old Headmaster. The codger's determination would crumble in the face of new belief, and the new order of justice would embrace their fate. The world would neither be ruled nor saved. It would quite simply survive, through whatever ugly rebirth it would take. Because Aberforth knew that the stars in his brother's eyes were from madness, not genius, and that, no matter what the cost, he would not allow the world to be pinned under the thumb of Albus Dumbledore.
