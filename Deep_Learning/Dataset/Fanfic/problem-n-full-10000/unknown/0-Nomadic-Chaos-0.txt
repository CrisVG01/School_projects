faces light up at the idea "By Merlin if the idea isn't risky but, I'm willing to do it if it means I get a chance to bring our family back together and maybe try and teach him how to be a duelist like his old man." James agreed to that prospect "I'm in it as well if it means I can at least have a second chance with our son and hopefully see him grow into a wonderful wizard like we did with his brother then I'm all in." Lily spoke in agreement with her husband "Then it's all settled I shall gather the order and convene on the best way to accomplish this." Dumbledore spoke as he heard the overjoyed parents speak about what they'd do in the event they got their son back while he thought one thing "Soon all the pieces will be in place for me to destroy him once and for all and then my plans will be fully realized." Dumbledore thought as soon everything would go accordingly with the greater good of wizarding-kind Now then the stage has been set for the story of the former Potter now a criminal enforcer to become entangled in the wizarding world the question is will he be shoehorned into being it's unlikely hero or become a worse threat than even Voldemort. Find out more in the new chapters of Harry Potter: The Belladonna Chronicles And end scene there as man was this a bit tricky to write but I think I did it and hope you guys enjoyed it also to clarify something yes this gonna be a modernized story since it gives me more to work with and it'll help with one of the themes surrounding the story, but anyways let's get down to what happened shall we I hoped you guys liked the first scene as while you can bitch and moan at me for not doing the whole origin story of him going through the years and showing everything of what happened to him like every other author does on this site. I skipped it to just get to him killing Dudley and his friends because this is going to be a dark Harry who will stay dark and as for his powers of telekinesis they will be explained later on in the story as the reason behind why he has them instead of magic The next scene was more of to how he's now involved in the crime life and also for those of you that want to bitch and complain about his name change from Harry to Adam I'll explain it as this he doesn't want to be reminded of how he was weak and abused by the Dursley's therefore he changed his name to Adam so he wouldn't have that reminder anymore. Also this further showed more of his personality of him wanting to be feared and have the power to do what he wants because he doesn't really want your respect so much as your fear and the fact that he's grown to love hurting people something of which will be expanded on in later chapters Next up is the scene where he and his two newest friends and partners Cristina and Max helped in a mission given to where they had to murder the remnants of rival gangs in London as it was done to show two things. One to introduce the characters that are like his version of Ron and Hermione except with their own personality issues and also these characters will still have relevance in the story as they both play their part in both the wizarding and muggle world. And to so further growth in his personality in who he and how he'll be for the remainder of the story as unlike the majority of Harry Potter stories where he starts out as dark but eventually becomes a goody two shoes he's staying the way I portray him no matter what Lastly we have is both the bar scene and the scene at Grimmauld place as I'll get to the former of the two and what they served. The bar scene served to show a bit of the dichotomy between Adam, Cristina and Max as friends as it shows that even though they're all criminals with fucked up personality traits they still manage to have a cohesive friendship with each other and the fact that it showed one of Adam's red buttons in that you don't ever call him Harry. And the Grimmauld Place scene was to set up what would happen very soon in the story as Dumbledore has now manipulated the Potters into getting Adam back by playing on the fact that Voldemort is still a threat and that he'd be safer with them and more over at Hogwarts With that being all done and over with please favorite, follow, share and review this story as much as possible as this is my first ever Harry Potter story and I hope for it to do well so please give this as much support as possible. And please give me as many reviews as you like as it let's me know what I'm doing good and how I can improve upon the story with your constructive criticism so long as it isn't flaming And special thanks to Kourtney Uzu Yato who's been helping me make this story possible as without her this story would've still been in the works for quite a while so special thanks to her and please check out her stories as they don't disappoint With that being said this is Nomadic Chaos using the powers of Chaos to give you bigger and better content and next chapter will be more of Adam with his friends as well as what he does in the meantime with them as well as the Order making their move Year 5 arc Theme Song: Enraged by The Unguided Random End Song: Bad Company by DVSR
