mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears. *the water from the fountain pulls Nancy in* Percy Jackson Voiceover: I don't remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her butt in the fountain, screaming. Nancy Bobofit: Percy pushed me! *Mrs. Dodds materializes next to them* Unnamed Kid #1: Did you see- Unnamed Kid #2: -the water- Unnamed Kid #3: -like it grabbed her- Percy Jackson Voiceover: I didn't know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again. Percy Jackson Voiceover: As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her a new shirt at the museum gift shop, etc. , etc. , Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her eyes, as if I'd done something she'd been waiting for all semester. Mrs. Dodds: Now, honey- Percy Jackson: *grumbling* I know, a month erasing workbooks. Percy Jackson Voiceover: That wasn't the right thing to say. Mrs. Dodds: Come with me. Grover Underwood: Wait! It was me. I pushed her. Percy Jackson Voiceover: I stared at him, stunned. I couldn't believe he was trying to cover for me. Mrs. Dodds scared Grover to death. *Mrs. Dodds stares at Grover and his whiskery chin trembles* Mrs. Dodds: I don't think so, Mr. Underwood. Grover Underwood: But- Mrs. Dodds: You- will -stay-here. *Grover looks at Percy desperately* Percy Jackson: It's okay, man. Thanks for trying. Mrs. Dodds: Honey. Now. *Nancy smirks at Percy* Percy Jackson Voiceover: I gave her my deluxe I'll-kill-you-later stare. Then I turned to face Mrs. Dodds, but she wasn't there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently at me to come on. *Percy looks confused* Percy Jackson Voiceover: I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I know I've missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank place behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting things. Percy Jackson Voiceover: I wasn't so sure. *Percy goes after Mrs. Dodds* *Halfway up the steps, Percy glances back at Grover who seems like he's trying to signal Mr. Brunner* *Percy looks back at Mrs. Dodds who is now at the end of the entrance hall* Percy Jackson Voiceover: Okay, I thought. She's going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop. Percy Jackson Voiceover: But apparently that wasn't the plan. *Percy finally catches up with Mrs. Dodds in the Greek and Roman section* *The gallery is empty, expect for the two of them* *Mrs. Dodds stands in from of a marble frieze of the Greek Gods with her arms crossed, and she is slightly growling* Mrs. Dodds: You've been giving us problems, honey. Percy Jackson: Yes ma'am. Mrs. Dodds: *tugging on the cuffs of her leather jacket* Did you really think you could get away with it. Percy Jackson: *is nervous* I'll - I'll try harder ma'am. *thunder shakes the building* Mrs. Dodds: We are not fools, Percy Jackson. It was only a matter of time before we found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain. Percy Jackson Voiceover: I didn't know what she was talking about. Percy Jackson Voiceover: All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were going to make me read the book. Mrs. Dodds: *demandingly* Well? Percy Jackson: Ma'am I don'tâ€¦ Mrs. Dodds: Your time is up. *Mrs. Dodds' eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn't human. She was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to ribbons.* Percy Jackson Voiceover: Then things got even stranger. *screen fades to black* *screen shows Mr. Brunner entering the gallery* Mr. Brunner: *tossing a pen at Percy* What ho, Percy! *Mrs. Dodds lunges at Percy* *Percy yelps and dodges, feeling the talons slash the air next to his ear* *Percy snatches the ballpoint pen out of the ears which turns to a bronze sword as soon as he touches it* *Mrs. Dodds spins toward Percy with a murderous look in her eyes* *Percy is shaking and almost drops the sword* Mrs. Dodds: *snarling* Die, honey! *Mrs. Dodds flies straight at Percy* *Percy swings the sword in absolute terror. It hits Mrs. Dodds' shoulder, passes clean through her body and she explodes into yellow powder leaving a smell of sulfur, a dying screech and a chill of evil* *Percy stands in the gallery, alone, trembling* *Percy heads back outside, where it had started to rain* Nancy Bobofit: I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt. Percy Jackson: *confused* Who? Nancy Bobofit: Our teacher . Duh! Percy Jackson: What are you talking about? *Nancy rolls her eyes and turns away* Percy Jackson: Grover, where's Mrs. Dodds? Grover Underwood: *pauses* Who? Percy Jackson: Not funny, man. This is serious. *thunders booms overhead* *Percy looks over at Mr. Brunner and heads over* Mr. Brunner: *distractedly* Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson. *Percy hands Mr. Brunner his pen* Percy Jackson: Sir, where's Mrs. Dodds? Mr. Brunner: *stares at Percy blankly* Who? Percy Jackson: The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre- algebra teacher. Mr. Brunner: *frowning and looking mildly concerned* Percy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all right?
