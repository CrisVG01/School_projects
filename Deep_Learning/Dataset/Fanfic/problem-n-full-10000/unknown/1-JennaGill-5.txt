and swirls the tip with her tongue, keeping a firm grip on his base. She doesn't want him to hold back, he certainly didn't earlier. "I dreamed about sneaking into the art studio, where you spent all of your free time at school. And doing this to you while you painted." She places a light kiss on the tip, this time keeping her eyes trained on his expression, "I wondered if you could still hold the brush, while you fucked my mouth.' He doesn't disappoint her next, by grabbing her head and pushing himself into her waiting mouth. She squeezes his balls and he comes again. Unloading into her throat. "Damn, Everdeen." "Like I said. Living out a fantasy" "Well keep them coming" They fall into bed and his mouth finds her again and again. On her lips, on her other lips. She feels like her undercarriage has received a very comprehensive cleaning tonight. He's not done with her yet though. They lay side by side in his bed, too tired to sit up when she feels him, hard and expectant at her thigh. He reaches for another condom and adjusts her leg so that together, they look like a scissor-tailed fly catcher in motion. His warm breath fans across her ear as he purrs, "I have a dream or two about you too." He moves into her to punctuate his admission. "You complete your part of the pep rally with the flaming arrows and then I steal you away under the bleachers," he continues. He's not as deep as he was earlier, but she can still feel all of him as he slides in and out of her with just enough friction. His fingers seek out her clit and rub lazily to match his slow thrusts. She can hardly speak from the delicious pleasure he's administering, but she would like to hear how his fantasy plays out. "And….?" she sighs. "And then I bend you over, flip that tiny little skirt over your waist, and give you a light spank," he divulges. He's still barreling into her with every little detail. "Once your beautiful ass is nice and pink, I rid you of your bloomers. And you are begging me to fuck you. You wiggle your ass and hold on tight to the bleacher supports as I slam into you over and over. I tell you to go ahead and shout when you come, because no one can hear you over the crowd anyway, and like a good girl you do," he finishes. His words work in tandem with his body and she's soon incoherently chanting out his name. Her tremors proceed his orgasm again. "Tell me more tomorrow," she asks before drifting off. They sleep a blissful sleep. There are no dreams, just rest and recovery under an old quilt. ************************************************************************************************************ The morning light hits his face. His eyelashes are just as bright and blond as she remembers when fixating on them in school. His stubble is more pronounced this morning. She just stares at him and tries to reconcile the idea that she's actually waking up in his bed. He's beautiful. And she's here, with him. She's broken from her musings when he starts to stir. She kisses his eyes, his nose, his eye lashes, and decides she wants him again. She places kisses on his neck and works her way down his chest. She gives his cock a firm lick up and down but his morning wood is already in full effect. He reaches for another condom in his bedside table drawer and places it on himself. "I want to ride you," she announces in throaty tone. "We'll that's only fair. You gave me a ride only yesterday," he grins as she straddles him. "Yes, yesterday...a lot can happen in a day" she says as she holds his tip at her core. But before she drops onto him, she decides to set some ground rules. "This… is happening, you and me. This now means that you'll only be fucking me for the foreseeable future. Say yes," she commands. "Yes, god yes," he exclaims. "Good, because this is one ride you'll always want," she promises as she reunites their bodies. "I hoped it was you," Peeta said. "What? When?" Katniss puzzles. They are back on I-12 the next Saturday. They had been nearly inseparable all week, getting to know each other again. At present, he wanted company on his original errand. "We just passed the spot you picked me up last week. When I saw the green Beetle pull over, I wanted it to be you behind the wheel. Not too many of those cars around, and I hoped the odds were in my favor. I've been wasting so much time with the girls in town, not really finding what I was looking for… always mad at myself for never working up the nerve to talk to you all of those years," he admits. She reaches over to stroke his forearm as he continues, her short finger nails skimming the freckles there. He has opened up plenty in the last week in between the explorations of their bodies, though this is uncharted territory. "But they were in your favor. And it was me," she volunteers. He veers of the road at this and throws the truck into park. He hops out of his side of the car, jogs around to hers, and pulls her out of the truck. He pulls her tightly to him, lifting her up in the process. "I'd like to think this would have happened anyway," he says longingly. His smile is infectious and she returns it. Her nose nuzzles his before their lips connect. This kiss is an acknowledgement. A promise. Her tongue probes his mouth as her body burns for him. They stay locked in their embrace as other cars pass by and honk, pulling her out of the moment. She rests her forehead on his. "I do too," she convinces him.
