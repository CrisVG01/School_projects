I called out, "I thought the note explained everything." "Yeah, well maybe I want to hear you say it." Bella said in a slightly angry tone. She crossed her arms and stared me down. If I tried to step around her she'd step in my path. I was starting to feel my anger spike. "Not smart, Bella." I grumbled, it was a warning. She didn't take it of course. I didn't want to be nasty to her, but it looked like she was going to leave me no actual choice in the matter. "Get lost, Bella. Go cry over your leech. We're on two totally different paths in life. And the path you're going down is not one I want to be even remotely associated with." I snapped. She looked hurt, her lip wavered for a moment. I was almost impressed, she was even pulling out the crocodile tears today from the looks of it. "Please Jacob.. Don't leave me too." "Bella, I checked out of this a long time ago." "You didn't." "I did. Trust me. I think I realized what you were really about when you only started wanting me around to find out what Edward was.. Or when he left for a little while there. But you were even using me then because when you did dangerous things you felt closer to him. Admit it! You never wanted me, Bella." I spoke angrily, not caring how cold my tone was with her. It's like I've said. I'm totally done with her. If I stand a chance with Eve, I'm taking it as soon as I can get the all clear to do it. And I really don't give a rats ass if I hurt Bella in the process. Why should I? She didn't care how many times she hurt me or Eve or Charlie even.. She's never cared who she hurts as long as she gets exactly what she wants. Well now, she'll have it. If her precious leech comes back again, that is. If not, not my problem. You couldn't pay me to even consider being friends with her again now. She teared up, I freaked internally. I hate making people cry, especially girls.. It just never feels right. But I kept the straightest face I could all things considered and turned her around, gave her a gentle but firm nudge to her truck. "Go." "Jacob.." she started, falling silent. She sighed and walked away and I had this feeling then.. She wasn't going to just fade into the background easily and let me finally be free to have my own happiness. She was going to make this as hard as possible, especially when I finally got to tell Eve that she's my imprint and that the reason I've been staying away is because Bella pisses me off too much and I won't risk Eve's safety. There's a right way and a wrong way to do things. I've done things the wrong way. But now? I'm going to do them my way. Hopefully, it'll be the right way. DISCLAIMERS AND WARNINGS: FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU'RE READING THIS, I ALREADY LOVE YOU, DEARIE. SECONDLY, I DO NOT OWN TWILIGHT SAGA OR ANY OF IT'S CANON CHARACTERS/EVENTS/ETC, NOR DO I OWN THE SONG WHICH I TOOK THE TITLE FOR THIS STORY FROM, I'M JUST THE GIRL NEXT DOOR BY SAVING JANE (OR ANY OTHER LYRICS I MIGHT USE AS TITLES OF CHAPTERS). THIRD OF ALL, I MAKE NO PROFIT OFF OF THIS. THIS IS JUST A WRITER FIXING THE THINGS THAT ANNOYED/IRRITATED HER. AND YOU GUYS MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ANYTHING I CHANGE OR ADD OR EVEN MY OC (ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S A !SISTERFIC AND OC IS BELLA'S YOUNGER SISTER EVETTE. ) NOW ONTO THE WARNINGS: HEAVY BELLA BASHING. LOOK, I HATED HER. I NOTICED ALL THESE REALLY NASTY THINGS ABOUT HER THAT WERE SORT OF JUST GLOSSED OVER DURING THE BOOKS WHILE SM WAS TRYING TO MAKE HER PERFECT, IN MY OPINION, SHE CREATED A REALLY FLAWED AND MESSED UP PERSON IF YOU LOOK AT THE FLIPSIDE TO EVERYTHING SHE DID/SAID/FELT. AND SHE SEEMED SNOTTY AF TO ME TOO. FOR EXAMPLE, IN NEW MOON, THE THING WITH JESSICA STANLEY IN PORT ANGELES. JESSICA WAS ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO SAVE HER ASS THAT NIGHT SHE TRIED THE THING WITH THE GANG OF MOTORCYCLISTS. AND THEN SHE TALKS CRAP ABOUT JESSICA FOR TRYING TO SAVE HER ASS? STUPID. OKAY, ALRIGHT, I'LL RANT ABOUT BELLA ALL DAY LONG LATER. IF ANYONE WANTS TO RANT WITH ME, FEEL FREE TO HIT UP MY , SORRY IF THE BASHING OFFENDS, BUT YES. THERE WILL BE LOTS OF IT. JACOB X OC PAIRING. I WANTED JACOB TO HAVE A FLUFFY/SEXY/FUNNY LOVE STORY THING, OKAY? SO I MADE HIM A THING. HOPEFULLY PEOPLE LIKE THE THING I'VE MADE. IF NOT, APOLOGIES TO ALL. !SISTERFIC. YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW. SISTER FIC AGAIN? HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO ONE? I WANTED TO TRY IT OUT. IF NOBODY LIKES, I'LL TAKE IT DOWN. NOT A BIG DEAL TO ME. JUST SOMETHING I WROTE AND WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU DEARIES. NO BABY IMPRINTS .. SO ALL IMPRINTS WILL BE AGE APPROPRIATE. BEST OF ALL, NO JACOB IMPRINTING ON BELLA'S DEMON SPAWN. THIS STORY WILL BE HEAVY ON SHAPESHIFTERS, LIGHT AF ON VAMPIRES UNLESS THEY'RE CALLED FOR/IT'S SOMETHING FROM THE ACTUAL CANON TIMELINE I WANNA KEEP.. BY THE END I'LL HOPEFULLY HAVE BELLA PHASED OUT TOO BECAUSE SHE'S TOO TEDIOUS TO TRY AND EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND AND I FRANKLY DON'T WANNA. I'LL MOST LIKELY SEND HER AWAY TO LIVE WITH HER SPARKLY ICE BLOCK SOMEWHERE ELSE FAR FAR AWAY FROM FORKS BY THE TIME BREAKING DAWN I & II ROLLS AROUND. THE STUFF WILL STILL HAPPEN SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, SO SHE'LL BE IN A LITTLE . BUT NOT MUCH IF I CAN HELP IT. AAAND THAT'S ABOUT IT! KISSES, JJ P.S: NOTES WILL BE VERY MUCH SHORTER NEXT CHAPTER I SWEAR TO GOD ABOVE.
