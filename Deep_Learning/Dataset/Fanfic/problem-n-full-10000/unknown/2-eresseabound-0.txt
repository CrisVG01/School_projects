"Do you know who we are...?" "No..." "We are the dead." "Leave me be..." "The damned." "I beg of you!" "We weren't granted that mercy, ringbearer." "Savior." "D-don't mock me." His quavering voice belied the fear in his feeble demand. "Yes... praise the Halflings..." "Praise them with great praise..." "S-Sam." A frozen hand brushed Frodo's cheek. "Sa-am." He couldn't scream. " No one will come ..." " No one saved us ..." " Look upon us, Ringbearer ..." " See our pain ..." "Please..." His voice was too faint. Frigid wind spun about him, curling itself around his limbs, strangling him. He at last glanced up. There was nothing he could do but stare- his bright eyes locked in terror. The faces in the marsh. The dead faces. That was the only thought that his horror encased mind could possibly summon. The ethereal bodies that were forever doomed to lie drowning in foul waters had left their phantom graves and sought him. They glared down at him in disgust through hollow eyes. Their haggard, skeletal faces drawn into a pinched leer. White, clammy hands reached for him- pushing him down. Forcing him back. Threatening to send him down- beneath the grassy surface of the earth. He could see their blood. Dense, colourless liquid dripping sickly from their rusting mail. He knew how they had died. From the spears stuck through their hearts or the arrows through their throat or their cloven heads. " Come back with us ..." " We are lost ..." " Nameless ..." " We have no graves ..." " But there is one dug for you ..." "No..." " You should have died ..." " You were the reason for the loss of so many lives ..." " Yes you could not manage to lose your own ..." "N-no..." " Isn't that right, Ringbearer ?" " Wretch ." " Damned ." " Why didn't you die ?" " But you would have died in honour ..." " In valour ..." " Not nameless and alone ..." " But you don't deserve that ..." " You'll die alone ..." " Now you'll hurt ..." " You'll know our pain ..." Frodo covered his ears but it made no difference. " Frodo ..." Frodo gaped. He was staring himself in the eyes. But not the self he was now. The self he remembered. Healthy and strong. No maimed hand or pained existence. But the once merry eyes were blazing. " You let me die ... you killed yourself- can't you see. Why don't you kill yourself again. Because of dear Sam? He doesn't care about you. It's me he thinks he knows. He doesn't understand- you are nothing. You aren't Frodo Baggins. Frodo Baggins is already dead- and you ... murdered ... him ." Frodo, at last, could stand no more. "SAM!" "Sam!" Sam heard the desperate cry. "Master!" He hollered into the night. "NO!" Sam sprinted wildly. He was to the river. He found the stones. Stumbled madly across. Into the trees. "SAM!" "Master?" Sam could hear him sobbing. But Frodo was no where to be seen. Horrible images spun through his mind. Frodo lying curled on the ground- his life's blood spilling from the slender gashes on his wrists. Frodo beaten senseless, left for dead. Sam stumbled blindly about until, at last, something snared his foot and he crashed to the ground. "Mister Frodo?" Sam had fallen nearly atop of his master. Frodo lay weeping beside him. Knees curled tightly to his chest, his head shielded by his shaking arms. He hastily sat to draw Frodo into his strong embrace but at the slightest touch of Sam's hand he began to shriek and flail madly. "NO! Leave me be!" His fist lashed out, connecting solidly with Sam's jaw. "Master!" Sam held him firmly, pinning Frodo's arms to his sides. "Please... PLEASE! Don't. Just leave me..." "Mister Frodo, please. It's me." "D-don't... I couldn't... I..." "It's your Sam." "No... SAM!" "Frodo!" "Sam..." Frodo's writhing ceased and he fell limp into the gardeners touch. Sam cradled him gently- resting his weary head in the crook of his arm. He rocked worriedly back and forth. "Mister Frodo?" Tears began to stream down Frodo's pale face from behind his fluttering lashes. "C-can you he-hear me?" He breathed, fighting with the lump swelling in his throat. He waited. His eyes began to sting. Frodo didn't move. "P-please..." He sobbed. At last he received a trembling nod. Sam buried his face in Frodo's curls. "T-they said...y-you wou-ouldn't c-come." "What?" Sam sat upright. "T-they s-s-said no one w-would co- come for m-me." "Who said that?" Sam tried to look him in the eyes but Frodo turned away. "Sir!" "T-they m-mocked me. Th-they s-said it w-was m-my fault." "Mister Frodo- what happened ?" Sam gasped. "C-can't y-you hear them?" Frodo's wide shadowed eyes stared accusingly up. "Master w-was some one h-here?" "Th-they're here." "Wh-" Sam's heart was beginning to race. He saw no one. "Th-they think I... they think I should..." Frodo wept into his friend's shoulder. "They t-think I... sh-should..." "Master... there's no one-" "...die." Sam's world spun. There was no one there. No one that he could see. But they wanted his master dead. Some one who wasn't real wanted his Mister Frodo dead. But how could anyone wish death upon him? " They could ." "And, Sam-" Frodo began to cough heavily, choking on tears. His stomach lurched. He rolled away from Sam's grasp as he began to wretch. Sam gently placed his strong hands on Frodo's waist to steady him. Frodo slowly sat- his sides heaving. Sam tugged his sleeve into his fist to dab at the corners of Frodo's mouth. But Frodo pushed him away. "Sam...Oh, Sam... I-I th-think I ag-aggree." "No- no. You don't!" "Sam..." Frodo swayed, threatening to swoon. Sam carefully pulled his master close- placing one arm about his shoulders and another beneath his knees, faltering slightly as he stood. "What..." "You're comin' home." TBC well...?
