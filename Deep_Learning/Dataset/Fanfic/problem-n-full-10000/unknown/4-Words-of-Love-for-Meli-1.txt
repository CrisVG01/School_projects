to the usual time allowed, still finishing at the top of your graduating class. "As your ma... friend, well, I feel ... unworthy of you." Bella reached out her hand to rest over his: "Edward, that is simply not true. You have done so much good in the world. Honestly, I think the main reason I have completed my schooling so quickly and done so well, is that I never really fit in with 'normal' people. I've spent most of my time alone. "My father died when I was young and I guess you could say my mother was a bit of a Will o'Wisp in human form. I followed her moving from one place to another until she died when I was 18. I was already at College by then and her death left me completely alone in the world. Losing her to a drunk driver, who should never have been on the road, drove me into studying law and my grief drove me to be the best. "So you see Edward you've done what you have done for completely unselfish reasons with no reward for yourself. Whereas I have done what I have done, if not for selfish reasons, certainly self-centred reasons." She sat back and took another sip of her tea. "I am so glad I can help you now with your goals. When do we fly to Forks?" "Thank you for your kind words, Bella. We can't really fly directly to Forks so we are flying to Port Angeles and then we are driving to Forks. Your personal things are already loaded on the jet with your furnishings being placed in my storage here. I've left some clothing for you on the bed, I will go dress for the trip and then meet you in the parlor in say an hour?" She nodded and he left the room closing the door behind him. Bella looked to see the bed was made and a pair of jeans and a blouse as well as underwear were on the bed waiting for her. She jumped in for another shower, dressed and then headed out switching on the lights in the hallways so she could find her way. She arrived back in the 'parlor' and took a seat, taking the opportunity to read more of the file. She'd been fascinated with the information about the vampires working with the USSS and other creatures as well. Tanya flew into the room, literally. "You better take good care of Edward, young lady." "I will, although from what I read last night, he's pretty much indestructible." "That's not what I mean, his body is strong as marble, but you be careful with his heart. He's innocent in the ways of modern women with their slovenly habits. He won't understand when you use him and lose him. So just you be careful with him." "I don't understand what you mean but I pretty sure I'm insulted." Just then Edward entered wearing what can only be described as an old-fashioned banker's suit. Bella thought that now was as good a time as any to start assimilating Edward into society. "Um, Edward?" "Yes my dear?" "Do you have anything less formal to wear?" He looked at his clothes and back up to Bella: "These are my travelling clothes. They are not in the least bit formal, I can assure you." Tanya flew to Bella's side and crossed her arms over each other, "I've bought him 'modern' clothes but he just won't wear them." Bella looked to Tanya, "Are there any jeans in his closet?" Tanya nodded enthusiastically. Bella went over and took Edward's hand: "Come on, lead me to your wardrobe, your assimilation starts now and it starts with some Calvins." Tanya giggled and flew ahead leading the way: "I think I might like you after all, Isabella." Bella laughed: "Don't call me that, I hate that name. Call me Bella." The girls dragged Edward back to his rooms and then into his very large walk-in wardrobe. Bella pulled out all the things, she found in the depths of his closet, that were appropriate for a 'modern' teenager and threw them on the bed. "Pick something from these to wear today, I'm going to pack the rest." She opened his suitcase and pulled out his perfectly folded but very 1920s appropriate clothing, including his long-john's. "Edward, you can't wear these ... ever!" Tanya laughed and grabbed the old fashioned clothes returning them to the closet. "Don't worry Edward they'll be here for you when you come home." After half an hour of packing and listening to Edward whine about inappropriate and uncomfortable clothing, he was finally dressed wearing a fabulous pair of jeans which hung low on his hips, a white t-shirt with a plaid over shirt. He had boots on his feet since he flatly refused to wear runners, and he carried a large wool jacket. He looked like a model on a casual shoot from a men's magazine. "Can we leave now?" he grumbled. "Not quite," Bella said as she shoved a Chicago Cubs baseball cap on his head. "Now we can go." "Bella, I can not wear this cap. First of all, we are not going to the baseball and secondly, I can not wear a hat while indoors." "Yes you can and yes you will." She placed a small kiss on his cheek. "Now come on, it's time to assimilate." She strode out of the room and headed back out to the lobby of the apartment. Edward grinned as he watched her leave and then turned to Tanya: "Goodbye old girl, wish me luck." Tanya kissed his forehead: "Don't 'old girl' me and you be careful. And be nice to Bella, I like her." He chuckled and kissed her temple before following after Bella, mumbling about uncomfortable underwear. A/N: Well I just adore this Edward. I hope you liked him too and that he gave you a smile. Love and virtual hugs.
