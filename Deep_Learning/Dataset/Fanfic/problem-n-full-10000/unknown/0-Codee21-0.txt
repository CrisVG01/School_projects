them, Albus. RON (ALBUS) What? Why me? HERMIONE (DELPHI) Because we're them . Come on. (HERMIONE (DELPHI) and HARRY (SCORPIUS) withdraw into the office. RON (ALBUS) closes the door.) RON (ALBUS) (with real angst) Why meee? (HERMIONE (DELPHI) and HARRY (SCORPIUS) run through the wings. There is a pause as it is made clear the actors are scrambling to get to the other side of the stage, with loud sounds of running footsteps. Enter HERMIONE and HARRY) HARRY Well, Hermione, thank you for your concern, but I think I'll be fine. After all, I am Harry Potter. HERMIONE (sees RON (ALBUS)) Ron! What are you doing here? RON (ALBUS) Nothing. I mean, uh, waiting for you! (HERMIONE leans in for a kiss. RON (ALBUS) sees it and stands there awkwardly. HERMIONE looks at him. RON (ALBUS) realizes what he has to do, and firmly kisses her.) HERMIONE Well. RON (ALBUS) What? HERMIONE I haven't been kissed like that for a long time. It's like we're young again. HARRY I should go... HERMIONE Really, Harry. Whatever you said to Albus, I'm sure it will be fine in the long run. RON (ALBUS) No it won't! HERMIONE What? RON (ALBUS) I mean, "No it won't" uh, be fine in the short run, but then it will be okay! Things like this happen all the time. HARRY I wish I could believe you. HERMIONE We all say things we don't mean. RON (ALBUS) And sometimes we say things we do mean. HERMIONE Not, now, Ron. Anyway, Harry, I'll see you around. (HARRY exits. HERMIONE tries to go into her office. RON (ALBUS) blocks her.) Ron, honestly. RON (ALBUS) (desperate) Don't you think we should have a baby, Aunt Hermione? I mean, Hermione? (HE kisses her again.) HERMIONE What? Another? RON (ALBUS) We could go discuss it, right now. HERMIONE Ronald Weasley, if there is another stink bomb in my office, nothing will save you. (RON (ALBUS), hoping for an opening, laughs sheepishly) Fine. I'll let you clean it up. But it had better be clean by two o'clock. I have a meeting with the head Gringots goblin then. RON (ALBUS) It will be. (HERMIONE and HARRY exit. RON (ALBUS) makes a face at HARRY'S retreating back. HE then enters the office, where HERMIONE (DELPHI) and HARRY (SCORPIUS) are waiting, having run through the wings once more. Bookshelves made up of two TECHIES holding up a black curtain and at least one shelf with books on it. A THIRD TECHIE holds books beneath the shelf, their hands coming through the curtain, as if the books are floating.) HARRY (SCORPIUS) You kissed your aunt. RON (ALBUS) Yes. HARRY (SCORPIUS) Was it good? RON (ALBUS) Shut up! HERMIONE (DELPHI) The time turner. It has to be here somewhere. We didn't touch anything while you were away - whenever someone in a fantasy series triggers a trap when the main character isn't there, things don't go too well for them. RON (ALBUS) Oh, how considerate. HARRY (SCORPIUS) (looking at the bookshelves) Let's try looking in the books. (HARRY (SCORPIUS) pulls one of the books from the TECHIE'S hands, then drops it as if it were hot. It begins to speak.) BOOK Answer me these questions three, ere the time turner you see. HARRY (SCORPIUS) Riddles! I love riddles! It's really convenient that I just told you that in the last scene, isn't it? It's a little disappointing that we don't seem to be in mortal danger, though... BOOK He who builds me doesn't use me He who buys me doesn't want me He who uses me – THE THREE Coffin! BOOK (sighing) Fine... Hmm... Oh, I know! The first is the fourth, a disappointing mark. You'll find it in parked but not in park. HERMIONE (DELPHI) This one is harder. BOOK The second is the less fair of those that walk on two legs. Grubby, hairy, a disease of the egg. And the third is both a mountain to climb and a route to take. RON (ALBUS) Scorpius? HARRY (SCORPIUS) I'm thinking, I'm thinking. (Suddenly, HERMIONE (DELPHI) is grabbed by the bookshelf and begins to be pulled behind the curtain) HERMIONE (DELPHI) Think faster! HARRY (SCORPIUS) Yay! We are in mortal danger! (Beat) The first is the fourth, a disappointing grade – a D? (HE shudders) Then what is the less fair of those who walk on both legs? A disease of the egg? HERMIONE (DELPHI) Men, obviously! (SHE disappears behind the curtain) RON (ALBUS) Delphi! De-men- what's that? Demons? HARRY (SCORPIUS) Dementors? RON (ALBUS) Wait, what's the third part? BOOK Correct! RON (ALBUS) What about the third part? DELPHI (from offstage) It doesn't matter! RON (ALBUS) Right. The riddles. BOOK The third and final riddle is... (Pause) What have I got in my pocketses? RON (ALBUS) What? That's not a riddle! That's not even from this series! (The BOOKSHELF grabs RON (ALBUS)) Hey! You don't even have pockets! BOOK Nope! What have I got in my pocketses? RON (ALBUS) Scorpius! HARRY (SCORPIUS) The one ring? BOOK (gleefully) Nope! (RON (ALBUS) is consumed) ALBUS (from offstage) Come on, Scorpius, think! HARRY (SCORPIUS) (Casting about wildly) I don't know. I don't know! Pockets? Like the inside of the covers? BOOK That's dust jackets, not pocketses. (The BOOKSHELF makes a grab for HARRY (SCORPIUS). HARRY (SCORPIUS) blocks the BOOKSHELF. THEY struggle. For a moment, HE disappears behind the curtain. There is a moment of total silence. Then SCORPIUS bursts back out, as himself.) SCORPIUS No! I'm a bookworm – I consume books, not the other way around! (SCORPIUS grabs the bookshelf's off-hand, carrying a pocketbook. SCORPIUS takes the pocketbook from the bookshelf.) Wait, wait! A book's pockets. A pocketbook ! (He opens the pocketbook – the time turner falls out onto the floor. The BOOKSHELF immediately retreats. The BOOKSHELVES eject DELPHI and ALBUS, both un-polyjuiced.) DELPHI Finally! ALBUS Yuck! I am never reading anything ever again. SCORPIUS Look guys . . . the time turner. DELPHI (ominously) Finally. (Blackout.)
