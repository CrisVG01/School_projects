movement. I am utterly trapped. Not surprisingly, he smiles arrogantly at me, "Now, you are a feisty one to take down. I hope you're worth it." I squirm beneath his touch, trying to reach him so that I can head butt him or something, anything, but it is not use, it only seems to excitement Cato more. "How does it feel to be helpless?" He asks, but I refuse to answer him. I will not give him the satisfaction. He thumb presses into the wound I acquired on my arm sending a fresh flow of blood pouring down my elbow. "Nasty cut you have there." His thumb now travels to my face and he grabs my cheek, smearing my own blood across it. "Just kill me," I say, keeping my face rid of emotion. His thumb runs over my bottom lip, his hot breath gliding over my skin. My vulnerability is achingly obvious. "I want you to beg ," he presses down harder on my hips, knowing that they will not be able to take the impact, "beg me for death." I can't help but let out a gasp as I hear a slight crack. I have to tread carefully, I know he wants to hear me scream. I look him steadily in the eye, not showing signs of weakness. Cato leans in closer and whispers in my ear. "I've killed people like you. They try to be brave, try to keep their dignity intact, but in the end, they all bleed the same, no matter who you are. I wonder how long you will take to break ." For a split second his skin touches mine and I resist flinching. His closeness is an attempt to frighten me. He thinks he has won, he believes I am submitting myself to him but I will not yield so easily. "Is that what they teach you at the academy?" I snarl, my resentment showing. "District 2. Known for creating hollow children starved of humanity, filling up their empty space with bitterness and hatred." I can see it now when I study Cato's bright eyes, they simmer with rage. He hates everyone and everything, even himself. "What age did they hook their claws into you?" Another crack from my hip as he pins me harder and a small scream escapes my lips. I continue relentlessly, even though I am pushing my luck. "Eight? Nine? When did they start to train a young boy to adore suffering?" "Enough!" He growls, both of his giant hands already tightly wrapped around my tiny throat. I've angered him, because he doesn't want to consider his past, all he cares about is killing; it's all he has. He doesn't break my neck though, even though he could so simply. It is as though he is waiting for something, but even he doesn't know what. He has let my hands go but they lie limply where he dropped him. I could grab Cato's sword which is sticking out of the ground next to him but it would be no use. Cato would finish me before I touched it. However, I am content to die. I always knew he would be the death of me. I sensed it from the beginning. I'm drawn to the wrong people. The fucked up individuals, as I call them. I stare up at Cato's bemused face and for some unknown reason, a small smirk appears on my lips when he grins at the purple bruises he has caused on the pale flesh of my throat. I have truly gone mad, and it makes me want to hysterically laugh, if only it was humorous. "So delicate," he observes. Without thinking, I brazenly reach out to him. He catches my hand aggressively but he doesn't stop my fingertips from brushing along his jawline. He is a child wronged by the world and I realise that I do not blame him. It is not all his fault he turned out the way he did, however evil he is, we are all just pieces in their game. I will always despise the Capitol, with a passion. "Kill me." I command. He analyses me and that's when we hear them. The other careers calling out for him, searching for us. I completely forgot about them, I was too transfixed in a state of horror and curiosity. Now. It has to be now. Cato understands this. He lifts his sword. And plunges it through my heart. I am floating upon the vast ocean. The rhythmic waves soothe my worries and, for a second, everything is gentle. But soon the weather changes abruptly, and the waters transform into a uncontrollable storm. I am dragged down by the sea's undercurrent. I struggle and thrash as I try to break the surface of the waves, but I am unsuccessful. I breathe in the salty liquid and it drowns my tired lungs, all instinct to survive has been subdued. I stop fighting it, and accept my fate. The storm passes. Everything is quiet now, just how I like it, and instead of sinking into the darkness, I reach out towards the light. My vision is becoming blurring, my mind slowing. This is how it is meant to be. The ocean wraps me in it's kind embrace and I accept with gratitude. I am home, at last. Authors note: This was a One-shot that I was inspired to do when I watched The Hunger Games again the other day. I noticed that the District 4 Female escaped the bloodbath but she was announced dead later on. After doing some research, I found a great opportunity to be creative and I always love exploring the mental instability of Cato. I started writing this with no idea how it would turn out but I am happy with the outcome and I hope you guys are too. This is strictly based off the film-version of The Hunger Games (tried to stick to it as accurately as possible).
