"Read it." he said. "I don't wanna read it." "I'll read mine if you read yours." He said. I sighed and started to read. Dear Santa, This is the first time I've ever written a letter to you and I don't really know what to say… I guess I'll start off by thanking you… because of you Percy's obsessed with Christmas and he's now making this the best Christmas ever. He's trying to check off everything on my Christmas List. This is one of them. I bet Santa isn't even reading this but it's just someone from the post office. But whoever you are, thanks for taking the time to read an eighteen year olds letter to Santa. Merry Christmas. -Annabeth Chase I finished reading and winced a little. "It sucks." I said. "That is the best Christmas letter I've ever read in my life." Percy said at the same time. I blushed. "Your turn." I said. "Okay but it isn't nearly as good." He warned. Dear Santa, Hey! It's Percy. This is gonna be the best Christmas ever. Annabeth doesn't celebrate Christmas so I'm trying to check everything off of her list. She's great. She deserves a perfect Christmas. She hasn't ever written a letter to you. Can you believe it? I hope she doesn't get her hands on this letter but then again I'm probably going to be reading it to her. You don't have to reply just give Annabeth a perfect Christmas. -Percy Jackson When he finished we were both blushing. "So yeah… I mail them later." He said putting his letter on the table. "What's next?" "Drink Eggnog and eat Christmas cookies." I said. "Oh… well that's easy." Percy said. "Mom! Beth's staying over for eggnog and cookies!" "Sure sweetie!" Came Sally's reply. "Anything else on the list?" Percy asked. "Yeah two more things… but they're weird. And improbable." "Just tell me." Percy said. "I'll tell you later." I said. He scrunched his eyebrows together but let it go. "Kids!" Sally called a few awkward minutes later. "Cookies are done!" "Thanks mom!" Percy said. "Let's go check off another thing off your list." We walked into the kitchen where Sally had placed two glasses of Eggnog and a plate of beautifully decorated cookies. "Dig in!" Sally said before walking out of the kitchen. "Oh yeah and one more thing…look up." I did and was shocked when I saw a tiny plant hanging from the roof directly above us. "Oh my gods." Percy said which caused me to look back down at him. He was blushing and I was sure that I was too. "Oh my gods." I agreed. Sally popped her head back in the kitchen. "Oh and on the cheek doesn't count and Percy if you refuse you will never have anything blue ever again." "Mom!" Percy grumbled. "You're welcome!" she said pulling out a camera. I looked down at my shoes. "If you're going to make us do this," Percy said. "I am." Sally replied. "At least put away the camera." Sally pouted but put it down then she left us alone. "Oh gods…" Percy said. "I'm sorry Annabeth." "Oh! No it's- it's fine." I stumbled. "I just…I've never been kissed…." I trailed off. "Really?" Percy asked. "Wow. I did not see that coming. Well I'll be sure to make your first kiss a good one." He grinned. I blushed. I looked down at my shoes. This was awkward… well, that is until Percy lifted my chin and leaned in close. Our noses brushed and he hesitated for a second before pressing his lips against mine. Percy smelled of ocean air. His lips were salty. He moved his hand from my chin to my cheek as the other rested on my waist. I rested my hands against his chest. After a few seconds of this we pulled away but that didn't last long. Percy pulled me against him and kissed me again. He wrapped his arms around my waist as I tangled my hands in his hair. This time when we pulled away Percy was grinning. "How's that for a first kiss?" he asked. "Not bad." I said teasingly. "But I would've expected better." Percy glared. "You know it was amazing." He said. "Yeah I know." I said as he kissed me again. ~o0o~ From: Percy Merry Christmas Wise Girl! Be at my house in 10 ~o0o~ "Merry Christmas!" Percy yelled when he opened the door. Then he kissed me. Then he dragged me inside. "Present time!" I laughed as he pulled me to sit down next to him by the Christmas tree. "You go first." "Okay." I said as I handed him my present. He shook it and grinned. Then he ripped the wrapping paper off and gaped. " An IPad pro?" he asked in disbelief. I nodded. "It's blue." I said. "What- how- why-?" "Well, you gave me my perfect Christmas so I thought I'd return the favor. Also, I saved alot of money so…yeah." I said. "Do you like it?" "Like it? Beth I love it!" he said before jumping on me with a kiss. I returned the favor. "Now it's my turn." He got up and grabbed something from the dining room before coming back with a small box and handing it to me. "Open it." he said. I raised an eyebrow before slowly tearing open the wrapping paper and opening the box to find a necklace I'd been wanting but never bought. It was a grey owl with emerald eyes. "Oh my gods Percy!" I said. "I've been wanting this for like ever!" I hugged him. "Thank you!" "You're Welcome." He grinned at me. "#BestChristmasEver!" I laughed and agreed. ~o0o~ Annabeth's Christmas Wish List Meet Santa Claus Go Sledding Write a Letter to Santa Drink Eggnog and Eat Christmas Cookies Mistletoe Kiss Christmas Romance ~o0o~ Hi!
