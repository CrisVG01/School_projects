bad about what she had done, but Katniss knew that that might never happen. She was too wrapped in guilt from other things, that perhaps she wouldn't notice one more. And the eyes Peeta had looked at her with; they were so sorrowful, but yet so knowing at the same time. He knew what she was going through, because he lived it almost the exact same way as she did. The sad, understanding eyes that had seemed to seep into her soul and find her, pull her back out and into him, and make her understand. But still, she had held fast to everything she had known and thought and believed. And not even Peeta and his loving, knowing stares could change that. The night was starting to wear into her aching, tired bones, and her eyes felt dry. She blinked, rapidly, trying to put some moisture back into them. All those shed tears seemed to have taken all the liquid from her. With heavy eyelids drooping over her sore eyes, Katniss made the large widened circle in the trees, following the familiar bend in the path, littered with brown pine needles and rotted berries. The carpeting on the forest floor was thin, with the Spring having taken all the debris away. The small berries were once more blooming on the bushes, the the dead pine needles had almost all been washed away by the rains. Katniss stifled a yawn, and tears once again sprung from her eyes against the strain. She didn't know why, and she cared even less, but the tears began to flow freely again, soaking her cheeks once more. Her hand was still pressed to her stomach, and she could feel the smallest of kicks up against her hand. And she thought that was what drove her over the edge, made her start sobbing openly once more. She was too emotional tonight… Peeta and her had half-heartedly discussed names for their baby, both male and female names that had been tossed around and then forgotten about. Katniss hated to think of it, and she would never have admitted it out loud, at least to Peeta anyway…but she wasn't entirely sure the baby would live long enough. She had heard too many times about a stillbirth, which had been far too common in District 12, even after the Hunger Games had ended. But the threat was still there; every year there had been babies born without any life to them, or completely dead from the start. And then the weak babies, too fragile to survive in the outside world, their tiny bodies giving up on them outside of the womb. Katniss' baby was kicking though, weakly but with a steadiness that put her at ease. It beat like a drum, one small kick after another, not seeming to end anytime soon. Another yawn reached across her mouth. Her jaws opened wide and another strangled cry escaped from her throat. Stomach swollen and feet aching, and still another two miles from her home, Katniss sat upon a large boulder, crowded in between two large and knotted trees. It was easy enough to climb up the rock, since the tree roots were thick and strong and wrapped around the rock. She picked her way up the roots, before settling down again. She was tired. She was so very tired. "What is wrong with me?" she thought aloud, her voice sounding oddly wet. The names Rue and Primrose had both floated through her mind, sounding oddly loving and hollow at the same time. For the same reason she liked those names, she disliked them for her child. They would remind her of her sister and friend, but in a way that she didn't want to be reminded of. Besides, she felt that it was some kind of cruel ploy to name a baby after a dead friend. Like it would somehow be robbing them of their own story. Carrying on the tradition of her mother's names was another thought, one that she didn't seem to mind all that much. She had been trying to forgive her mother, still after all this time, and it somehow got easier with the passing years, and the elongated distances. Especially the elongated distances. Nature names, and names of flowers that her mother had given her and her sister. Many different thoughts had come into both her head and Peeta's. Heather. Juniper. Lily. Luna. Even strange and crazy names had come onto the list, mainly by Peeta, who was trying to make her laugh at the time. Which she did. Cyprus. Delta. Lemongrass. Horn's Wood… "We could call them Horny for short," Peeta had said. That actually had made her laugh, just as the memory of it was easing away her pain now. "And if not Horny…well then, how about just Horn?" he had asked her, trying once more to make her laugh. Katniss had smiled and nodded, playing along with him for the time being. "I like that—" she had told him with a carefree smile. "Horn. Simple. Tasteful. Gender-neutral." Spots of ink started floating across her vision, dancing in the air before her in a splattering and dizzying pattern. Katniss blinked rapidly, trying to clear her sight, and then shook her head trying to clear away an approaching headache. A headache that had taken a long time to reach her. "I should go home now," she whispered to herself, climbing down off the boulder. Home. A place where she could shelter herself from the world for a small time; where she could go to bed, and lose herself in the soft warmth and tug the blankets up around her like a cocoon. Where a hopefully restful sleep waited for her, where she was see colorless voids instead of her dreams peppered by nightmares. "Let's get some sleep, Horn," she said to her belly, giving it a small pat. The baby kicked in what seemed to be a response. "And not scream…" Katniss added.
