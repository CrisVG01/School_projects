haven't met the right kind of dangerous yet." He told me. I stared at him. "And you're the right kind?" I asked. "You tell me." He stepped closer to me. "Why have you been watching me? And don't play dumb. I've seen you." "Maybe you're the only thing in this town worth watching." He countered. "Hardly," I told him. "Don't be so hard on yourself." "Don't tell me what to do." I told him. He smirked. "There's your fire. Do I scare you?" He asked. "No. Should you?" "Probably." He shrugged, still watching me. "What are you doing right now?" He asked. "Walking home," I told him. "Can I come?" He asked. I shrugged. "It's your funeral." I told him. "I'm good with parents." He told me. I laughed. "Good luck." I didn't say anything else the rest of the way. I have no idea why he wanted to come home with me. I'm not sure it really matters. He's got muscle. I can see it outlined through his clothes. Maybe Jeff will leave me along tonight. Maybe, just maybe. Here's to hoping. I unlocked the front door and I let him in after me. I locked it and I headed upstairs. I was stopped by a very sober mother. This is a first. "Hey mom, this is James." I introduced. She smiled. "It's nice to meet you. I'm Lauren." She gave him a hug. "You're late." She told me. "I texted you to tell you that I was having dinner with the Cullens. Did you not get it?" I asked. She pulled out her phone and frowned. "I must not have seen it earlier. Well, it's nice to meet you James." She smiled. "The pleasure is all mine." He assured, smiling. "Where's your husband?" I asked. She turned her attention back on me. "Jeff is spending a couple of weeks out of town on business. He'll be back by the end of the month." She told me. I beamed. That's fantastic news. "Karson offered to help me catch up in English. I've missed a little bit of school. Is that alright?" James asked her. "I don't see why not. I'm going to bed. Stay as long as you like. Goodnight." She went to the fridge to grab a bottle of wine before retiring to her room. Now, that's more like it. "Let's get to my room before she changes her mind." I told him. He followed me with a hand on my back. We got into my room and I locked the locks on my door. I have three deadbolts and a chain. He looked at me, questioningly. "Trouble in paradise?" He asked. "Her husband is an ass." I left it at that. He nodded. "Tell me why you're really here." I sat down on my bed. "I want to get to know you better." I told me. His stare is intense. "Why?" "You fascinate me." "Okay… What did you have in mind?" I asked. "Truth or dare," he smirked. I rolled my eyes. "Okay, you first." I told him. "Truth or dare?" He asked. "Dare." "I dare you to kiss me." He smirked. "How original." I walked over to him and planted my lips firmly on his. He kissed me back. He's so cold. Hm. I pulled away. "Truth or dare?" I asked him. "Truth," he said. "Were you following me?" I asked him. He chuckled. "I live around here. It was mostly coincidence that we ran into each other. Truth or dare?" "Truth." "How long has your mother been an alcoholic?" He asked. I shrugged. "A few years now, I guess. Your turn." "Dare." "Okay, I dare you to tell me why I fascinate you." I told him. He made a face. "I want to figure out who broke you." He answered. My face fell. I didn't say anything. "Was it Lauren or Jeff?" "Both," I told him. "Is it that obvious?" I asked. "Not really, but I know what to look for. You're trying so hard to be okay. I think it took an outsider to see it." He told me. "Truth or dare?" He asked. "Truth." "How long has he been hitting you?" He asked. I didn't say anything. "Okay, dare then. Show me your bruises." He tried again. I looked at him, for a second. I stood up and shed some layers and let him see the ones on my arms and legs. "What about your stomach?" I lifted up my shirt so he could see my purple stomach. "Truth or dare?" I asked, putting on pajama pants. I don't know why I started talking to him but I can't bring myself to stop. "Truth." "How do you know what to look for? Who hit you?" I asked. He looked at me for a minute before cracking a disturbing smile. "My mother," he answered. "Your turn." "Truth." "Do you want to learn how to defend yourself?" He asked. I nodded. "Please." He started showing me easy ways to defend myself. It's something so obvious that never even occurred to me. Learn self-defense. It will come in handy. We didn't talk too much but he ended up staying the night in my bed with me. I don't know why but I feel safer with him here. For the first time in a long time, I had dreamless sleep and I didn't wake up scared. Jeff will be back soon. Luck can't keep him away forever. ~*.*~ 'Failure is your disease – I want my outline drawn. You were my greatest failure; discourse your saving song. Was it over before, before it ever began?
