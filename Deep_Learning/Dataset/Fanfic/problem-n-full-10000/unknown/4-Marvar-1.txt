almost nothing." "I feel weird about this..." Emmett says. "It's that stupid sweater and Santa hat on your head." "It's warm!" he exclaims. "And it matches my sweater." "We're trying to get the girls back, not make them laugh hysterically." "I say we call them instead," Jasper chimes in. "Dude, don't you want to see them?" "Um, yeah, but not from a hospital bed." "Fuck both of you. I'm going on the roof by myself." My two friends exchange looks. "We'll go with you. But under protest." "Whatever," I mutter. "Fucking pussies can't even climb onto a roof and jump onto a tree branch from the second story. Elite athletes, my ass." . . . . . "They're going to have a heart attack from that last one. I hope my face doesn't show in it," Alice says. "Nah...It was buried in my cooch." We all giggle hysterically. Because that was funny. Or we're drunk. If the boys don't come running over after we basically acted out a scene from Dick the Halls , then I give up. Rosalie was a perfect Slutty Claus. THUMP. PLONK. "What the hell is that noise? It sounded like it was coming from the roof," Rose calls out. Alice snort-laughs. "It's Santa!" We hear footsteps on the roof. "And his reindeer!" I shout. "What if it's the Christmas Killer trying to get in?" Rose yells. "That's not a real thing!" "What if it is? We could be his first victims." "It's vampires!" "Geez. How many shots have you had, Rose?" "Enough to know I don't want to die, Bella." "I'll call my dad. Will that make you feel better?" "Yes." My dad promises to send a squad car over right away, since he can't drive over right now. He laughs and says it's probably Santa on the roof. But he tells me to get his Glock out just in case. We sit on my bed huddled together, hoping it's not actually the Christmas Killer. But that's more likely than it being Santa. "Up on the rooftop, quick, quick, quick...down through the chimney, came old St. Nick," we sing, hoping we won't be murdered in Christmas lingerie. . . . . . "So what now, genius?" "How the fuck would I know that Chief Swan trimmed the tree I always climbed on?" "Well, let's get down. This is over." "Um, we can't get down," I mumble. "Wait, did you say we couldn't get down from here?" Jasper asks. "Uh...no." "What the fuck, Edward?" Emmett yells. "Well, I always went out through the door after we...you know." "Well, we're screwed now." "No. This isn't that bad," Jasper says. He nods his head in the direction of the lights and sirens. "That's bad." . . . . . "Wait, Edward is on the roof?" I exclaim when my father calls. "Edward is the Christmas Killer?" Rose shouts. "Oh my god. You dodged a bullet, Bella." "Shut up, Rose. There is no Christmas Killer. Alice, get her some coffee." "Okay...where's the Starbucks?" Geez, am I the only one who can hold her liquor? I explain to my dad why I think Edward and his idiot friends got caught on my roof. "Yes, Daddy. I think a night in jail is exactly what he needs to straighten him out." . . . . . I knock my head against the bars of cell number two in the Forks' Police Department lock-up. We've been in here for a few hours. We've been texting the girls, begging forgiveness, but they still haven't come for us. "My mother is going to kill me," I say, hopelessly. "So's mine," Jasper whines. "My nana will never forgive me," Emmett says. "Well, you won't be getting anymore Christmas sweaters...so there's the silver lining to all this." "Geez, Edward. Prison has made you cynical." "Bella is never going to want to date an ex-con." "Especially one who's broken her heart," she says. "But you're not actually a felon. You didn't even get officially booked, morons. Jasper, Emmett, you're free to go. I think that you'll be pleased to see who is taking you home." She opens up the cell to let Emmett and Jasper out. "Thanks for bailing us out, Bella," Jasper says. "I didn't. Thank Alice. She showed Sam her boobs. He always had a thing for her." Jasper runs down the hall, Emmett trailing behind him. She turns and faces me. Her expression is unreadable. "Bella," I choke out, coming toward her. "I'm so sorry. Please...baby...I love you. Can you still love an idiot? I'll do anything. I'll beg." "Shut up, Edward. I've read all ninety-seven texts you sent me. I know how sorry you are." "I really am. My phone died or I would have sent more. I'll never take you for granted or listen to Garrett again, I swear. I know I was being immature." "Yes, you were...and Garrett is going to get his. He just got picked up for indecent exposure because he was doing Mrs. Stanley in her car in front of Rose's house. But fuck him. You almost lost me." "Almost? Are you going to forgive me?" I say, hopefully. I look at her, trying to convey my love through my eyes. She slips off the long coat she was wearing, revealing the skimpiest elf costume ever. She looks fucking awesome. "What do you think?" I cough. "Merry fucking Christmas to me." She straddles my lap, and I know I'm going to get laid in this cell. I'm getting the one thing I wanted for Christmas. There is a Santa Claus! She rubs herself against me, and her nipples are so hard they could shred my shirt. Then she nibbles on my earlobe and says, " Before you get too excited, you should know that we called your mothers and told them exactly what you did to us. So this will probably be the last time you ever touch me. Make it good." . . . . . .
