Are you ok?" Esme loved her children and was very mad at Aro. "Yeah. I'm ok Esme." Her and Emmett were allowed to stay together holding hands. But there were two men standing behind them at all times. This went on for hours. The only ones to not feel it yet were Carlisle, Edward (thank god), and Alice. I'm glad Alice hasn't felt it yet. She is a sweetie pie. I don't think she could handle it. I loved Edward. I have no idea how I would react if they went anywhere near him. Carlisle I think can handle it. He'd be ok. I hate seeing any of this. It was horrible. Aro saw the look in my eyes and basically read my mind. "I just realized something. A few of our friends haven't had any fun yet." He looked at me with a giant grin on his face. The hate that was bubbling inside me was about to burst. "Aro. I'm warning you. Don't you dare." Aro laughed at me. "I would never. But Jane and Alex would." He snapped and in a flash Edward was on the ground. Like Emmet before, he wasn't screaming. But I was. I was screaming so loud my own ears hurt. He was shaking and convulsing. I am a newborn. I'm much stronger than they think. And when fueled by anger... It gets much worse. Every dot of hate that I have ever felt in my life, joined together to create a huge ball of fire burning in my heart. I stomped hard on the man's foot. He let go for half a second. In that second I turned around and jumped on his shoulders. I was attempting to pull off his head. Edward began to scream which made me angrier. I ripped his head clean off and ran right to Aro. A few men came towards us but he waved at them. They froze. I pinned him to the wall. "You son of a bitch! Do you hear that sound?! That is my husband! And he is screaming in agony! And that is your fault! Because you are too afraid to fight your own damn battles! So you sick Jane and Alex on us! Well that PISSES me off! So you are going to stop torturing my family! And we are going to leave! Or I will rip your head off right now!" I tightened my grip on his neck. I felt it start to crack. He winced and I smiled. Edward was still screaming. Aro clapped and the screaming stopped. I turned to him to make sure he was okay. He was slowly standing up. He looked at me. He seemed confused at first but then he smiled at me and let the man behind him grab him. I turned back to Aro. "That's good. Step two, we leave. And you let us." She slowly let go of him and turned to walk towards her family. Aro clapped and the others were released. They walked out and sprinted home. BACK AT HOME (NO-ONE'S POV) They arrived home at about noon. "Is everyone ok?" Carlisle asked. They all responded 'yes'. Rosalie though, sounded a bit raspy and tired. "Rosalie? Can I speak to you in the other room?" Carlisle could probably tell that there was something wrong. "I guess." She followed him into the other room. "What is it?" She sounded desperate to get out. "What's wrong? And Rosalie if you say nothing I will be very annoyed." She sat up on his work desk and looked at the floor, swinging her legs. He walked over to her. "Rose. Tell me. What is it?" She sighed. "Since the first time they..." "Hurt you?" She nodded. "Since the first time I've been very anxious. When doors open, or someone yells... It scares me. I'm very jumpy all the time. I don't know why." She fiddled with her hands. "I'll tell you why. Rosalie, you were tortured very painfully, much more than anyone else. Then you watched your family get tortured. Including your lover. That would scare anyone." He gave her a reassuring smile. She had tears running down her face. "Oh. Rose what is it?" She had her hands over her face. "It hurt so bad." She was sobbing now. "And what hurt more was Emmett. He never looked away from me the whole time. He was so worried about me. But what hurt the most wasn't the physical pain. It was when they turned on Emmett. He was screaming so loud and then he wasn't screaming. He was in so much pain he couldn't even scream. And all I could do was watch." She was still crying but silently. Carlisle went over and hugged her. "Shh. It's ok." She leaned her head against his chest and wept silently. A few minutes later, they rejoined the others in the living room. Emmet was by her side in a second. "Hey Rose. You ok?" She nodded and gave him a big hug. They went up to their room. "Are you sure you're ok?" He walked over and sat next to her on the bed. "No. I'm really anxious." She looked down again. He put his arm around her. "Well. We're safe now. We're back home, in our room. They can't hurt you again. I promise." He laid on his back. She put her right hand and her head on his chest. Her left hand was around his upper arm. He put his arm to his right for her to use as a pillow. He put his other hand on the one on his chest. They laid like that for hours. Thanks for reading guys. It means a lot to me. And in case you couldn't tell, no this will not continue. It is a one-shot. As with most of the fanfictions I wirte. Yes, I have written a lot, but, I don't think I'll post them... They're more for me. But yeah, so bye!
