killed, they had someone take his place and 3 victors that didn't dersreve it won, then I came into power, Eris was the perfect candidate, the soft spoken boy who was easily muniplated, I made sure there were rebels reaped, I made sure he killed them, Serna and Kelsey only won because we didn't want the Capitol to get suspicious that all boys were winning and all killers, Corin was a simple one, he volunteered for his sister we wanted to test the waters and see how hard someone will fight to win, Hollis his medical record showed slight mental issues the scrawny boy ended up killing 6 careers with his bare hands, Callen the somber career boy forced into the games but had a real brain, why do you think we gave him that control dome and all the supplies to build the prefect traps the best thing was that he still personally killed his victims, Isaac another mentally unstable tributes force him to kill by accident he showed his true colours, Raiden the perfect actor, first the shy and concerned career leader later the manic boy who poisoned his victims then you, will made sure all of you won, whenever one of you were almost killed we made a weapon disappear or a mutation came out to save you" He says "Should I be happy or angry" I say "Happy, this is where you come in, Im making this year a surprise twist Year, twist 1, Dspending on Victor count, 11 and 12, will have one mentor, 1 and 9 will have 2 one for eachother tribute, 3,5,6,7, and 8 will have 3 mentors, one tribute will have 2 and one will have, districts 2,4 and 10, will have 4, 2 tributes each" He says "Not really a twist" I say He carefully puts 8 files in the table "Heroes vs villains, that's the year I want, 4 tributes that have the skills but use them for good, 4 that use it for bad" He says "Raiden won't be happy" I say "You would agree that with her around his trying to change, I want the fierce Raiden, the one that actually liked the captiol" He says "I don't think she should be reaped, especially not with her district partner, he seems to have many issues, but entertaining none of less" I say "I thought you would be happy" He says "I wanted her for myself" I say "Why?" He asks All these questions are pissing me off "I want my boy back we were tight after I won" I say "I want entertainment, I have never seen a District rivalry as strong as these two, that's the only reason, if she wins you can kill her" He says "Well you chosen well then, the villains I mean, A boy with ADHD who would obviously be in fairyland, A boy that paints with his own blood and has a strong desire to kill his furture partner" I say I pick up one file "His meant to be dead" I ask "He faked it, his been the murderer, his been good at hiding it too, but I have eyes everywhere" He says "How have you let this kid get away with 193 myrders" I ask pointing to the boy from 6's file "His killing unimportant people, we have never had four insane tributes in the games before" He says "Your throwing her in because of raiden to aren't you" I say "Did you see his interview it was worse then yours, she's the one people will be rooting for, so will the girl from four, recognise her" He asks "She has skill just doesn't use it correctly she would rather help people, the fight club kids seems good, and so does the theif, they won't allie though" I say "I know that, I have hand chosen my tributes there are a few else that have beeen chosen for a certain reason but they aren't Important, these 8 are" He says "Why" I ask "Your the head gamemaker this year, you control who wins and I want you too choose a Victor, one you must make sure wins and a decoy, that makes it to the final 2 but isn't meant to win, get the victor you choose and you may have a green card to freedom that means I will make you a Capitol assassin, fail and you will be a pretty boy for a hire, say no and well you may need to find a inhaler" he says "Fine" I mumble giving him the two files "nice choice, I like how the villain is the decoy" He says I shrug and he stands leaving me the file "nice doing business with you" He says walking out What a Moron he does know my actual decoy will be my actual Victor District 1- Male: Brecken Keridge, 18 Female: Kinsley Rinley, 18 District 2- Male: Sebastian Arymen, 17 Female: Taryn Ranrean, 16 District 3- Male: Wyatt Gerin, 17 Female: Elia Farnen, 13 District 4- Male: Theon Ayne, 18 Female: Braelyn Ward, 17 District 5- Male: Elliot Renlyn, 16 Female: Cecily Anders, 15 District 6- Male: Payton Reves, 17 Female: Finley Arin, 17 District 7- Male: Ellis Goren, 17 Female: Adelyn Caryn, 18 District 8- Male: Zander Collier, 18 Female: Verla Hastings, 15 District 9- Male: Tanner Derson, 16 Female: Carys Alerion, 12 District 10- Male: Mathias Zain, 18 Female: Aisley Ranilion, 17 District 11- Male: Dyson Fining, 18 Female: Fenna Arron, 17 District 12- Male: Kassian Cainridge, 16 Female: Celina Vagan, 15 Author note: Hi readers, hopefully I didn't make it too clear who is the chosen Victor and decoy but just to make sure, the person who is the chosen Victor may not win and the decoy may not die, since this isn't a SYOT some tributes will be getting more spotlight since they are important for this story but I will make sure not to give much away
