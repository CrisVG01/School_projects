he lingered by the door. "How was the drive?" "Alice didn't see?" "No." Edward said. "She can't see the wolves, remember?" He gave me a curious look. I nodded quickly, cringing. "It was fine." I had to get better at handling the medication. I had only been unsteady for a few days. "Good to hear." Edward said briskly. He looked around his room for a bit before his eyes found me again. "Bella," he started. I waited. When he didn't say anything else, his face tight with thought, I shrugged. "What? Secret?" "No." Edward said, looking shy. What had happened to him? Edward wasn't nearly this timid and awkward. "I'm just glad you're okay." I smiled, hot with the tense atmosphere, and turned back to unpacking a suitcase Alice had packed for me. "Me too." I didn't know when he left. I had forgotten how quiet everyone was. I was forgetting all sorts of things. I glanced over my shoulder to see him gone and I sank on the bed, grumbling. What was wrong with Edward? Dinner had been fine. Everyone had been happy to see me again. Sam Uley and the rest of the Pack was coming our way soon. Speaking of crossing borders, what if I ran into Charlie while I was here? How was I going to finish school? I laid onto my back and huffed, sick with anxiety. I focused on the ceiling above me and gritted my teeth as the anxiety turned back into nausea. This concussion sucked. I was completely dizzy when I sat up the next morning. First, I walked straight into the door, trying my hardest to grab the doorknob through my blurry vision to stop myself. I leaned against the door, trying to grab my bearings, and then I fell down the stairs on the way to the first floor. Jasper caught me by my armpits. "You okay?" "Hate concussions," I mumbled under my breath. I reached up awkwardly to grab Jasper's hand. He traded my armpits for my hands and gave me a cautious look. "You got a concussion?" "Alice didn't see?" I asked in the midst of my confusion. My vision was still wobbling. I shut my eyes tightly. "Crap." "What?" "That was a secret and now everyone knows." I muttered one of Sam's swear words in my head. "Why are you trying to keep that a secret?" Jasper sounded confused. His gold eyes pierced me worriedly. "You know Carlisle can give you something for it." I reached the railing and said lightly, "I don't remember what happened, so I don't know if he'd know how much to give me." "Bella?" Lizzie called. "Are you okay?" Jasper's eyes gazed at me. His eyebrows rose as concern crossed his face. "You don't remember?" "Nope." I said briskly. "Liz, I'm fine!" "Are you sure?" Lizzie shouted. "You fell pretty hard!" "I'm fine!" "You-" " I'm fine! " "Okay, stop yelling!" "You stop yelling at me!" Sam shouted. "Stop yelling!" "Sorry!" We shouted at him. Jasper wasn't smiling. "Bella-" "Just. . ." I fumbled. ". . . Trust me." Jasper's eyes narrowed and he let me go. "Not everyone's here." "Really? Who's gone?" "Everyone except me, Sam, and Liz. Sam wanted to go hunting, but he went last night." Jasper gave me a glare. "Lucky it's just us." "Unless you tell them." "I won't." "Why?" Jasper shrugged. "'Cause I owe you one." "Hardly." "No, I do." Jasper said. "Thanks to Sam and Riley, I'm not a newborn anymore." A strange feeling settled over me. It was a mixture of confusion and gratitude. Jasper smiled and nodded sincerely. Sam ruined it by shouting, " What's that supposed to mean? " Jasper looked past me and rolled his eyes. The action made me smile and he vanished. "Your secret's safe with us," he hissed. I watched Jasper go and reached for the fallen pill bottle on the floor. I grabbed it, stood up, and sighed as my ears began to ring. Lizzie clomped down the stairs, "You good?" She huffed. I froze. "When did you get here?" "Seth." Lizzie said matter-of-factly. I grinned. "Seth as in, ' we're a pair ', or Seth as in, ' he dragged me over here '?" Lizzie narrowed her eyes. "A little of the first one, but mostly the second one." "You're giving him a chance?" Lizzie shook her head, saddened. "More like he's giving me a chance." Her little fling with Logan flew into my mind. My smile faded. "Oh, right." "Mh-hm." Lizzie nodded knowingly. She surprised me by giving me a hug. "Missed ya, bestie." "Aw, Lizzie ." "Shut up." Lizzie pulled away immediately, but flashed me a smile. "Let's go eat. You don't look so pink anymore." We entered the kitchen and I gasped when I saw Sam cooking. He frowned. "Whatcha lookin' at? Sit down and eat these eggs." I inhaled the smell. "I'm surprised Edward let you cook." "What? The man's a chef?" Lizzie sighed wistfully. "Might as well be. Between him and Esme, I don't know what to eat first." Sam smiled goofily. "You're gonna to eat these eggs and you're gonna like 'em." "What if they kill me?" Sam said in a reasonable tone, as if he had already planned an alternative. "We'll hide your body." "If the venom doesn't spread fast enough." I butted in. Sam gave me a grin. "Right." He set the places in front of us. "Now eat the eggs or die." "I guess that's what it comes down to." Lizzie flashed me a look. I smiled, but only for a moment. Eat or die. Fight or die. Jane had told me to leave Forks or die. I guess I didn't really have a choice. A dark thought filled my head, allowing me to mentally drift out of the kitchen. Why did Jane lie? Why did she let me think she was going to live? And why, other than for my protection, did Jacob bring me back?
