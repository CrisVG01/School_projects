for the dental costs, on the condition you stop changing your email. I had to go to, like, three different people to get this one. Sound good? Annabeth P.S.-Sorry about the table. Weak moment. Would rectify if I could go back in time, but seeing as how this is physically impossible as of circa 2004, I must make do with simple apologies. To: Hazel Levesque [ hazel . levesque { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Hazel, you're such a sweetheart. Really. Thank you for looking out - you're a great HR rep! - but other than my own mistakes, which are now being rectified and revenged upon, there's not much that you can help with. You're such a darling. Thanks! Love, Annabeth Chase Senior Journalist Architecture Weekly Magazine P.S.- check the bulletin board in the Features department for my revenge upon the one and only Luke Castellan. Though, of course, I was out because I had the bubonic plague. Clearly. To: Lucas Castellan [ lucas . castellan { a t } ARweekly . net] From: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Maturity Luke, Check the bulletin board. Love, Annabeth P.S.- No, I don't like Yo-Yo Ma. The only acceptable classical music is Dvorak, Hayden, or Debussy. And yes, I do like the Grateful Dead. Psychedelic music is life. Especially the Beatles'. POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD IN FEATURES DEPARTMENT OF ARCHITECTURE WEEKLY MAGAZINE Document Type: Genetic analysis Determined by: Dr. Roger Bann Name of patient: Lucas Castellan Type of test: sexual disease Date of test: 3/4/04 Results: Lucas Castellan Diseases: syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea Note (written by Annabeth Chase): LADIES: BEWARE!

To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Lucas Castellan [ lucas . castellan { a t } ARweekly . net] Re: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?! If you don't think I'm getting my lawyers involved, you're out of your mind, Chase. To: Lucas Castellan [ lucas . castellan { a t } ARweekly . net] From: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Hey, pardner Hey, there. That's a real document. I know this because I was there when you got it, and was there when you complained about having sexual diseases and having me not - well, you know, do it - with you, and using your seven affairs as leverage. Oh, trust me. I was there. So, pardner, hang on in there, 'cause I've got the best lawyer in town. Also: BITE ME. Annabeth To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Drew Tanaka [ drew . tanaka { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Inappropriate documents Miss Chase, Due to your lack of respect for the office bulletin board, your HR rep, Drew Tanaka, has issued a verbal warning. It is as follows: Dear Miss Chase, Your lack of respect for the office bulletin board is appalling. Here at Architecture Weekly Magazine, we work as a team! We do not attempt to attain 'revenge', as you have told us numerous times when an explanation was demanded. We simply attempt peace and harmony in our workplace. The bulletin board is not to be used for revenge, or posting of people's private lives, as you have done in the case of Mr. Castellan. Doctoral bills - sexual disease test or not - must be kept private. I assure you, Mr. Castellan's doctoral bill is in his private folder. However, this is not to be shared with the general populace of the magazine. Should Mr. Castellan decide to sue, you, Annabeth Chase, will be responsible for any costs. Work towards your winning team, Miss Chase! Please note any further offenses may result in suspension or termination. Drew Tanaka Head of Human Resources Architecture Weekly Magazine This document is intended for the recipient of Miss Annabeth Chase only. Any other recipient should immediately delete this document and notify the company toward which it is attributed. To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Piper McLean [ piper . mclean { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Delete this email as soon as you get it, because though we have been forbidden to discuss Lucas's problems over email, I must say: Excellent job at revenge. Though you might now be fired. But I say it's worth it. Pipes ;) To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Chiron Brunner [ chiron . brunner { a t } ] Re: Revenge I can't say whether I'm proud or dismayed. As your boss: dismayed. As any human being who knows Castellan: proud. Chiron Brunner Editor-in-Chief Architecture Weekly Magazine P.S.- Watch out. Bacchus is on the warpath. To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Bacchus E. Dionysus [ bacchu dionysus { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Bullshit Chase, that's the biggest amount of bullshit I've read. About the bubonic plague. And as for Castellan, I hope you have your lawyer on speed dial. Come up to my office now and explain to me why I shouldn't fire you from this company immediately. Because I'm kind of wondering that myself as of right now. Bacchus E.

I think I'm in trouble. It was worth it, right? Right? RIGHT?! Annabeth A/N: So, if you want more, let me know!
