his heart seriously might being going into cardiac arrest. And not from fatty foods. Nico managed a smile. "You know me so well." Will snorted and the rest was routine. He tapped on the screen. Nico handed him some cash. Their hands touched as Will returned the change – though this time the amount of contact was a bit unnecessary but totally welcome. "So, you're lone-wolfing it tonight, huh?" Will asked. Nico sighed. "Yeah. I needed a break from studying. I was going crazy just sitting in my dorm." "I hear ya. Midterms have got me pretty swamped, too. But just standing here is even worse." "Do you get a break?" Nico asked. What am I doing? Will raised an eyebrow. "Yeah. Why?" He shrugged. "Well, by the time I walk back to my dorm my food'll be cold. So I'm just gonna eat here." Will picked up on his drift immediately. "Well, I couldn't let you eat alone." And that was how Nico had managed to get Will to eat dinner with him in the empty McDonald's. He had a few more minutes before he could take his break, and told him to go sit down and he'd join in a moment. Nico took a seat at the usual place his friends ate at and waited, playing with the straw simply for something to do. Will returned a few moments later with a salad and a water bottle in hand. Nico happily eyed his legs as he approached. He'd only ever seen the other boy behind a counter and, whoa, those were some seriously skinny jeans. Not that Nico was complaining. He sat across from Nico with a sigh. "Thank God!" he groaned. "Work sucks!" Nico just scoffed. "A salad? Really?" "What?" Will huffed. "I told you. I can't stomach the burgers here. I've seen things, Nico. Horrible things." "I'd like to stay ignorant, please." Will chuckled. "I don't have a problem with other people endangering their bodies." Nico rolled his eyes. "I'm not endangering my body!" "Dude, you eat here, like, once a week. That can't be healthy." "And what makes you an expert?" "I'm a pre-med student," Will said simply. Nico frowned. "So, why's a pre-med student working at a fast-food restaurant?" Will shrugged. "It's close." He took a sip of his water. "All right. So what about you? What's your major?" "Forensics," Nico answered. "What kind?" "Ah, well, bone analysis, mostly." He shrank in on himself. He was used to people telling him his major was creepy. "So, you wanna work for the police and all that?" Nico nodded. "That's so cool!" Will lit up. "I have to look at bones every day in my anatomy class, and, boy!" He whistled. "Good luck!" Nico relaxed. "Thanks," he said dryly. "Oh, and, I've been meaning to ask, but where are you from exactly?" "Italy. I was born in Venice." "I figured from the accent it was something like that but, ugh, I'm so jealous. Venice just sounds so much fancier than Manhattan. Anyways, you've seen a lot of the city yet?" Nico nodded. "My roommate has been pretty adamant on that, yeah." "And does Mr. Di Angelo from Venice like what he sees?" Nico had just enough courage to smirk, never looking away from Will's face. "Yes. He does." A light blush colored those tan cheeks and Nico awarded himself with a fry. They talked about anything and everything. Nico couldn't remember the last time he'd enjoyed himself so much. Nico lost track of time, too caught up in some story Will was telling him about his family, until a sudden thought struck him. "Crap! What time is it? Don't you have to get back to work?" Will's eyes widened. "Crap!" He shot up. "I gotta go!" He took half a step then stopped and turned back. "Uh, I really liked talking to you. Um." Was he really blushing? "We should do it again. Soon." Internally, Nico was screaming and doing a victory dance. Outwardly, he just smiled. "Yeah. Definitely." Will's smile turned nervous. "But not at McDonald's." The mental screaming stopped. Nico froze. "Wait…" He locked eyes with him. "Are you asking me out?" Will raised his shoulders and shrunk back a bit, looking adorably nervous. "Yeah?" Nico tried to play it cool. He really did. But the giddy smile ruined the effect. "Well, you could've asked for my number first." Will visibly relaxed and suddenly everything was different but better. "So is that a yes?" A bubble of laughter escaped him. He quickly silenced it and began to fish around in his overstuffed pockets for a pen. He grabbed a napkin and scribbled his cell number on it before handing it over to Will. "Do you work Saturday?" Will took it as if it was a holy offering. "I'm off." "Good." Nico stood. "Because I found this really good Italian place nearby. It's genuine." Will held up his empty hand. "Wait. Am I asking you out and are you asking me out?" Nico thought for a moment. "Both?" Will blinked. "Both works." "SOLACE!" an angry voice shouted from the back. "Crap!" Will jumped. "I'M COMING!" He turned back to Nico. "Sorry. Duty calls." "I get it." He shrugged on his jacket. "I should be going anyways. Midterms tomorrow." Will nodded. "So… I'll text you?" "You'd better." Will beamed and sent him another wink before wishing him a goodnight. Nico said a soft goodbye and watched as he disappeared behind the counter, no doubt getting yelled at by his boss. He managed to contain himself as he left the restaurant but, as soon as the doors closed behind him, he pumped both fists in the air and made an excited noise that he would never, ever let another person hear. America hadn't been what Nico was expecting at all. It was even better. A/N: As you can see, I had too much fun with this. I may or may not write a second part. ...Maybe. X3
