chance. He'd throw them out. I'll show mom first, then he can't." "Good idea," she laughs. Her face rearranges into a much more serious look, "You should probably stay home tomorrow. Gale's going to need all the support he can get when the training scores come out." "But that won't be until the night," he makes a face. "It'll make for a long day for him," she pats his hair down in the back. He grins then throws his arms around her waist, "I like you Madge. You're nice. Even about my grouchy brother." ######################################## The next day Madge avoids her garden, it's too lonely a place without her newfound friend. She's inside, lying on the floor with her legs propped up on the sofa, waiting for the score show, when the phone rings. The housekeeper is gone for the day, her father is still at the Justice Building, and her mother is on a morphling holiday so the only person who can answer the phone is her. She contemplates letting it ring out, it's for her father anyways, but no one calls so it must be important. Grudgingly, she rolls over and stomps up the stairs to her father's office. She carefully picks up the phone, "Hello?" "How's my little Pearl?" Madge frowns, "Mr. Abernathy, to what do I owe the pleasure?" "Oh, this and that." He answers evasively. "My Tributes this year have some fire in them. Made me sober up some." For some reason that doesn't sound as good as it should. "Oh, good. Katniss is a friend of mine, actually. I'm really pulling for her." "That's nice, sweetheart." He chews on something, "Look I can't talk long. I have to go get ready for the scores. Tight schedule you know. Won't be able to get any shut eye till at least eleven, unfortunately. The Capitol's the city that never sleeps." Madge nods, before she realizes she can't be seen through the phone. "Of course. Get some rest." "Watch for that bird on before the scores. She's back on for analysis. Little wench. Her hair is green now." With that he's hung up. Madge frowns at the receiver. That was by and large the oddest conversation she's ever had in her life. She isn't certain what she was just told, but she has a sense of urgency building up in her stomach. Mr. Abernathy has never called about Tributes before and that alone makes her uneasy. She checks that her mother is still soundly asleep then takes off for her father's office. The Peacekeepers there know her and don't give her any grief and she quickly shuffles into her father's office. "Hello Pearl, is something wrong?" His brow creases in concern so Madge smiles and tries to act nonchalant. "No, just bored. Mom's asleep." He smiles and looks back at the paper he had been working on. She bites her lip, "Mr. Abernathy called." He keeps writing. "He said to watch for some 'bird' with green hair on for analysis tonight." His pen stops moving, but he keeps his head down. "Oh?" Madge nods, "He also said he isn't drinking as much apparently. That's nice isn't it?" Her father looks up with a faint smile, he's catching onto something Madge hasn't and it eats at her insides. She finishes up, "He said he's pretty tired. City's so busy, up all the time, you know? He had to be quick because of the scores being tonight and had a tight schedule. Won't be able to go to sleep until eleven." Her father's face is set with the same hint of a smile, but he's gleaned something from the vague words. Madge can see something creeping into his eyes. He stands sharply, "I think I can catch up with this tomorrow, don't you think? Let's head home." He takes her by the arm and they leave, down the steps and to the road leading to their house. Madge glances around, "Something's wrong isn't it?" He makes a face, "Not wrong. Just…thought provoking." It's as vague as anything and Madge narrows her eyes. "Thought provoking how?" ###################################### The fact that Katniss was going to be awarded an '11', the highest score any Tribute from 12 had ever received should have been exciting. For Madge, however, it was now a source of anxiety. Her father, calmly and quietly, had explained that there was a very real possibility that Katniss' score-gained no doubt by her skill with a bow-would earn the District the inquiry they had been worried about. "They aren't allowed to discuss what happened during the private sessions," Madge countered. There could be no inquiry if they didn't know what she'd done. "Don't be naïve," her father had run a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. "They don't discuss the private sessions with the public at large. The President and other high ranking officials, they'll have gotten recordings." That made her stomach churn. Her blue eyes darted all around them before speaking again, "What-is there-what can we do?" He'd stopped and smiled slightly. "We probably have enough warning that we can come up with a plausible explanation for how she got so good with a bow." "We could say she's a natural athlete," Madge offered. "We were gym partners so I could back it up, and she did do well in class. If there's any question I could just say she held back for my sake." For a moment he looked as if he's going to argue, but a group of kids, all small and happy, are playing a game of red rover and catch his attention. He watches them for a long moment before sighing. His eyes are shining when he looks back to Madge. "I hate to put you in that position. If there were ever any questions…but," he shakes his head, "it would protect the District as a whole more than likely. Unfortunate, but necessary." "Then that's what we'll do." Madge feels her stomach lurch, "For the District."
