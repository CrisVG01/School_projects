said with a laugh in his voice. "Yes." I growled again and he busted out laughing. I smiled as he turned down the road that leads to my house. "Your so cute when you growl." Edward said as he drove down the road. I blushed more and he is looking at me. "Why you say that for?" I said to him. "Cause its true Nyla." Edward said with a smile. He pulled up to my house and his mouth fell open. "How you have a nice house. I bet you and your family have partys out here." Edward said to me. "I'm a orphan. So its just me here." I said with a small smile. Edward looked sad at me. "I'm sorry Nyla I didn't know." Edward said softly to me. "Its ok. It dont bother me at all." I lied as I put my hand on the handly. "Let me walk you to your door." Edward said before he got out and came around to my side of the door. He opened my door and I got out and he walked me to my door in the pouring rain. "You didn't have to walk me to the door and get all soak in wet." I said as I pushed my wet hair out of my face. Edward smiled at me. "I don't mind Nyla. I was raise as a gentleman." Edward said to me. "It good to know there are still gentleman out there." I said and he smiled at me. "I wish my girlfriend like that." Edward said with a sadness in his voice. I huffed up. "If she dot like it then she should take that stick out of her ass. I know its a new age and all but its still nice to know there is guys out there that are still like that." I said with a smile. Edward smiled a little. "Bella is Bella." He said and I knew who he is talking about. I have a few class with her. The rain started to rain harder. "Would you like to come in till the rain lightens up?" I asked him. "Sure." He said as I unlocked the door. I let him in and I followed in after him. I closed the door I went to closet and got two towels. One black and one red. Edward watched me as I walked over to him and handed him the red one. "Thank you." Edward with a crooket smile. "Your welcome." I said softly and in a shy voice with a smile. "Would you like a drink or anything?" I asked him. "That's nice of you but no thank you. I'm fine." Edward said with a smile. "Ok sorry about the boxes. I haven't had time to finish unpacking." I said as he followed me to the huge kitchen. "I see you like to read." Edward said as I started to make my self some some hot black tea. The good stuff not that cheap shit. "I do like to read. You should see my library." I said and he smiled at me. Edward had the towel around his shoulds and his hair is still dripping wet. I walked over to him took his towel and put it on his head and started to dry his hair. "Your going to get sick if you don't dry your hair Edward." I said and he put his head back to look up at me. "I don't get sick easy. Thank you Nyla." Edward said with that crooket smile that make's me blush. "Your welcome." I said as I finished drying his hair. The tea is ready and I got my self a cup of tea and sat down. "So Edward what you like to do in your free time?" I asked him as I took a small sip of tea. "I like to read, listen to music, play music and hanging with Bella and my family." Edward said and I nodded. "What do you like to do?" Edward said to me. "I like to read, listen to music, sing, paint, write, mostly I put my hands into everything that sounds good." I said with a bit of sadness in my voice. Cause I want to do things before I die. "What's wrong?" Edward asked me. I looked into his golden eyes. "It's nothing." I said and he looked me in the eyes with worry. "You can tell me Nyla. I'm a good listener." Edward said to me softly. I let out a sigh. "It really is nothing Edward. Talking about it wont help. It just make me depressed if I talk about it. So don't worry about me Edward. I be fine." I lied as I smiled at him. "If you change your mind I'm here for you." Edward said as he pulled my cell over to him. "What are you doing?" I asked him. "I'm putting my number into your phone if you need anything you can call me. Do you need a ride tomorrow?" Edward said. I looked at my cup of tea. "Thank you Edward. My part to my truck wont be in till friday. But you don't have to drive all the way out here to pick me up. I don't mind walking to school." I said and he looked at me. "That is a long walk to town. I be by to pick you up tomorrow. So you dont have to walk." Edward said with a little growl in his voice. "While I run to town not walk. Cause walking take's to long." I said with a smile. "Your a smart ass aren't you?" Edward said with a smile. "Some times." I said before I looked away from him. Hello every one! ! !
