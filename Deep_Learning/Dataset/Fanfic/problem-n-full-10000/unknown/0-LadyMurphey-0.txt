Rachel's apartment, take her and Thomas. Get in the car and go. Go to Glasgow, I will meet you there." Roger didn't know anything, but the terrorized gaze in his wife's eyes told him to ask no questions. She watched as he left through the common area to meet Rachel. Heard footsteps on the stairs two seconds after that. Mentally, she recited all the spells she could use in a duel. There was nothing to block a death curse, however. So as the unknown wizard appeared on top of the stairs, she pointed her wand to him and shouted. " EXPELLIARMUS!" His wand flew from his hand and landed on her feet. Lina still had her wand in hand, threatening him. The wizard raised his hands to the hood and threw it back. She sighed in relief. The man was Sirius Black. "My goodness, Sirius!" She said, her heart still pounding and the wand still in hand. She remembered something. "How did we use to call you in school?" "Padfoot!" He answered. Than asked. "What did I call you?" "Linny" She said, blushing. He rushed to hug her. "Did you get my letter? Is that why you are here?" "I had heard rumours that you could be in Edinburgh. After last night, I just jumped in a train. I had to find you. It was easier than I expected." "What about last night?" She cut him. "Oh, Lina..." His voice was a mix of pity and pain. "Lily and James are dead." "What? Dead? Was that what happened in Godric's Hollow?" "Yes. You-Know-Who found them. Wormtail gave them away." Lina felt as if the ground was gone. She walked into the living room to sit on the couch. Her red hair was trembling under the moonlight. She stared at the carpet. The tears came soon enough. "Merlin's beard, Lina, everyone thought I was the one who knew! They are gonna think I betrayed them!" He grabbed her shoulders, shaking her. He had the eyes of a mad man. "Sirius, calm down! Come, sit down, I will make you a cup of tea!" She said. "No. I have to go soon. They will look for me." "I can hide you! We will figure out something we can do." "I Have to go. I will only put you and your family in danger." His voice was cold, painful. "Anyway, there's some good news at last. The boy lived. And the Dark Lord is gone." "Gone?" She whispered in shock. "Wait, what boy?" "Their boy. Harry. My godson!" He shouted. "Oh, Lina, how can you not know? Haven't you even taken a look outside? What have you been doing since you left? Since you deserted the war? Shutting your eyes to our world… hiding like a coward. You left me , Lina! ME! A witch like you. You… you were valuable to us! Maybe the Potters would still be alive if..." He didn't seem himself. Lina cried uncontrolably, unsure if the cause was the loss of her friends or Sirius' words. Still, she got a grip of herself and shouted back. "I couldn't have done anything! I knew too much! Too many names! I couldn't risk giving it to him!" Sirius was shaking. "I know…" He fell to his knees in front of her. "I'm sorry I said all of that. It's just that… James and Lily..." She hugged him, stroking his hair as both cried. "You have to believe me, Lina. I didn't do it. I didn't tell him." He cried. She cupped his face between her hands. "I believe you." She whispered. Then he kissed her. Deeply. Both could feel how each other longed for that moment for the past five years. She could feel it. She belonged with him. With her world. She should go back with him. She didn't even love Roger. She liked him a lot of course, he was an amazing husband. But her heart belonged to Sirius and there was nothing she could possibly do about that. But then there was Elise. Her little baby. She couldn't go. Lina broke the kiss. "I am so sorry..." She said. "Come with me, Lina. Let's go somewhere else. Let's hide somewhere… We can go to… We can go to Brazil, or Australia… you always said you wanted to go somewhere warmer, didn't you?" "I can't… I can't leave Elise here." "Then bring her along! We can be a family, like we always wanted!" "How can I go back, Sirius? After leaving like that… After so many have died, how can I go back and face everyone?" "Who gives a damn about everyone? You don't have to look at them, we can go somewhere where there's just the two of us!" "Hiding? Running away from Aurors? How can I put Elise through that? Sirius… If it were just me, I would follow you without blinking. But it's not. I can't do this to her." There were tears in her eyes again. "I… I understand." He said, with what seemed to be a knot in his throat. "I… I must leave, then." "No. Please, stay some more!" Even after refusing his offer, Lina was still desperate to spend some time with him. "How could the boy survive? There's no way to survive a killing curse!" "I know." Answered Sirius. "It's a mystery. He is the boy who lived. The one who defeated You-Know-Who." "After all of that… A little boy..." "He has a mark. A scar on his forehead, where the curse reached him. He… He looks so much like James. But has Lily's eyes." Sirius touched her cheek with one finger, touching her freckles. "I missed you so much..." He whispered. Lina held his hand and kissed it's palm. "So did I. And I will still miss you, every single day." "I love you, Lina." He said. And got his answer. Than, with another deep kiss, he said goodbye. Walked to the middle of the living room and disapparated.
