on the voicemail and pressed the phone to my ear. " Hullo, Love," —Edward's voice always soothed me— "I'm going out to hunt with Jasper. We'll be gone for less than an hour. Please don't worry… I'll be back,"— I smiled—" I promise. I'm sure Alice can keep you entertained while I'm gone. I love you so very, very, much. "—I swallowed— "I'll be back before you know it." The message ended. I swallowed again and took a shaky breath. I sniffled. "I'll be back, I promise," repeated over and over inside my head. I remembered what I had heard the voices whisper. I remembered the conversation Alice had with Jasper. I remembered the conversation Edward had had with Carlisle. I remembered when he was hopeful I would live, and when he despaired that I would die. I sniffled and started to cry again, harder this time. I cried for Edward. I hope he's okay, I thought. I cried for Renesmee. Did she think I was dead? Did everyone think I was dead? I wanted to be with her—to hold her. I was so confused and tired and scared. I cried until I couldn't anymore and sat in silence, listening to the forest around me. "This sucks." I mumbled. Almost as if in agreement, my phone buzzed with a new message. (Unknown_9:22pm) Hi. I sat staring at my phone, confused. I had no service. How was I receiving messages? (Unknown_9:23pm) You're confused. That's okay. I opened my phone and checked the number—it was unlisted. (Unknown_9:23pm) You don't know me, but I'm here to help you. I promise. Help me? I mouthed. I was utterly confused. (Unknown_9:23pm) I'm really glad you're here. I typed my message with shaking fingers. (Bella_9:24) Who are you? (Unknown_9:25pm) I'm not important. (Bella_9:25) Where am I? How do you know me? (Unknown_9:25pm) I don't know you, yet. I've been waiting a long time for you to get here. I swallowed. This was weird . Who was this guy? (Bella_9:26) Now? (Unknown_9:25pm) It's important. I promise. My phone started to buzz. This guy wasn't waiting for a response. I clutched my phone tightly, unsure of what to do. When it stopped ringing, the quiet of the forrest seemed… louder. More ominous. My phone started buzzing again. With each vibration, my apprehension grew. Should I answer it? Who was this person? What did they want with me? Again, my phone fell silent. Almost five minutes later, it rang again. I bit my lip. It was so quiet in the woods that every sound seemed to echo in the air, suspended for the briefest instance, before vanishing. Marshaling up my courage, I took a deep breath and picked up the call. "Hello?" It was silent for so long that I thought there might never be an answer. "Bella?" The voice on the other end of the line didn't sound much older than I was. It was quiet, modulated, and female. "That's me." I said, feeling oddly vulnerable in the middle of that quiet, empty forrest. Another silence. "I'm glad you're here." She sounded very genuine. "Thank you," I replied feeling… awkward. "Could you, uhm, tell me who you are?" She sighed apologetically. "I really wish I could." "…you can't?" I stumbled over the words. "Things would get… complicated if you knew and I don't have much time." "That's… not very helpful." "I'm really sorry," She said. "But things are about to get really… really … difficult for you. And there's information I need to—" A loud bang sounded on the other end of the line. "—give you. Shit." She swore. "What's—" I began to ask. She cut across me impatiently. "No time for that now. You have to listen to me right now, do you understand? If you don't you're dead." Another bang—a gunshot. "Fuck." I heard a muffled voice on the other end of the line. " I need a minute." She hissed. " Please ." Another bang. "Listen Bella. Right now, I need you to get up and start running. Don't stop—no matter what happens—no matter what you see—you have to keep going—you have to make it through the night." I heard a snarl "I don't know who else he has in there. I fucked this up—goddammit—you have to get out of that forrest. Head north—get to Port Angeles. I'll be able to find you there." "Wait—" This was all happening to fast. "I'll help you as much as I can but—" The line went dead. All around me the forrest was quiet again. I bit my lip. Who was that girl? My phone rang again. I picked it up with shaking fingers. "What's happening? Are you alright? Where are you—" "I'm sorry." I froze. "She's not here at the moment." This voice wasn't female. This voice was low, deep, and rich. It was unmistakable. A vampire was on the other end of the line. Snarls sounded loudly in the background. I could hear screaming—and growling. Fear blossomed deep in my stomach and spread outward, crippling me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remove the phone from my ear. "I'd like to welcome you to my little corner of paradise, Bella." "What do you want?" My voice was barely a whisper. " Retribution ." The voice rumbled. "Retribution? For what?" The voice laughed. "Oh my dear, sweet, Bella. Haven't we moved beyond that? Haven't we?" His voice became sweet as honey. "I will never forget, dear, sweet, girl." "Forget what? Please. I didn't do anything to you." I whimpered. "Didn't you?" There was anger now in his voice. "Lets see if I can… jog your memory a bit." He laughed, and the world around me exploded into chaos. Ending Note: Bella is, like, all over the place in this chapter. She's just feeling a little bit overwhelmed right now. I'd probably be too, come to think of it. Poor girl. Let me know what you think of this story. It's pretty out there . Cheers!
