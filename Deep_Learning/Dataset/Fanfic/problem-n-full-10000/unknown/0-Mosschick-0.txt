He continues. We walk quietly back to the Great hall. "Hey Caroline!" He greets his sister. "Hey!" She greets him back. "Thanks again Ella for getting him for me." She smiles at me. "No problem at all." I say. "I think i'm going to hang out with Ashie for a bit, See 'ya later." I continue. "Bye!" Caroline says. "Bye." Oliver says. I walk over to Ashie. "Who was that guy?" She asks. "Oh, Caroline's brother." I answer. "He's kinda cute~" She says. "Why would you think that?" I look back at Oliver. "You know, the jet black hair, cute glasses." She continues. "Aww, Do you think my glasses are cute?" I ask jokingly. We both laugh. Chapter 6 Ashie *Ring Ring!* My phone rings and I pick it up. Its Caroline. "Hey C!" I Whisper shout. You see, After Ella introduced us, we started talking and agreed Oliver and Ellanora would look cute together, and we made it this year's mission. "One second, Ell! " I Yell to her, and walk to the nearest empty classroom. "So you did it?!" I Ask, Impatient. "Sure did!" Caroline says, Grinning on the other side of the call. "Okay well, See you!" I Say, Happy. I look down at the phone after I hang up. I see a tempting game called 'Jelly Jump' and start playing. It takes a lot of concentration, so I Didn't notice a boy- Wham! I look up, because I'm super short. This had to be the cutest boy I've ever seen. "Heh.. He-Hello!" I say, Nervously. I Notice he's wearing a Hufflepuff scarf. "U-Uh.. Hai.." He says. "Sorry.." We both say at the same time, while I look at my feet and he scratches the back of his head and looks away. "Uhhm… I-I Haven't seen you around… In the Hufflepuff commons that is…" I stutter. "Well, I'm not exactly social…" He responds. There is a long pause. "Uhh, Sorry I-uh need to go…" I finally speak. I dodge my way around the boy and leave. I get outside of the classroom. "Ugh I didn't even ask his name!" I mutter to myself. "Whaevah.." I murmur. As I walk out of the classroom, I'm confronted by Scarlet. "OoO~! A new crush I presume?" she teases. "Hey! Were you STALKING me?" "Pfffft. Who would want to do that? I was just simply walking by and happened to hear you. That's it. " She says, Making a face like this .3. "I'm going to see Ellanora, Come if you must." I say, Really not happy with her teasing. "Mkay, I'm coming." she says. "Can't you take a hint?" I murmur in reply. We walk and walk until we find Ellanora. "Guess who has her first crush!" Scarlet says, dragging out the 'crush' part. "Shht!" I Say, Bumping her. "Aww, Scarlet! I thought the day would never come!" Ell says, Clearly joking. "Eugh! Not me, Smarty pants. Obviously ASHIE!" She yells. We're talking at the bottom of the super tall room with all the stairs in it, So It Echos Echos Echos Echos. "As I jab Scarlet in the side with my elbow." I Say, Narrating my actions. Ell smiles kindly. "Guess who I saw staring at Oliver!" Says a different voice. Ells smile leaves her face. We all turn around. "May!" I say. "Was it Ell?" Me and Scarlett ask. Ell is standing very still, It also seems like she's blushing. "No… I-I wasn't…" She mutters. "Teeheeeeee" I giggle. "You're giggling for no reason! I wasn't staring at anyone!" Ell insists. "Right~" I tease her. I pat my belly that's full of food. "Oh man, I will never eat that much pumpkin pie again!" I say with emphasis. It was almost Halloween, and therefore we stuffed ourselves with the leftovers from thanksgiving. "Hah. Lucky for me, I'm not a pig." Says Scarlet, from across the table. Not many people were here, because they wanted to spend Halloween with their families, so we were allowed to sit wherever we wanted. "Bye.. I'm goin' to bed!" I say, Yawning. "Why, Ash?" Ellanora asks me. I pat my stomach, and Ellanora gets it. "See ya!" I say, already walking out of the great hall. As soon as I get into the commons, I lay on the couch, and before I know it, I'm fast asleep. I wake up to something warm pressing against my bare feet. "Huh?" I mutter. I look up and there is CHAT NOIR! NYHEHEEHEHKEKEKEKEK Jk, it's actually the guy from earlier, and he's pressed up against the side of the couch, barely squeezing in between me and the end of the couch. I feel pretty guilty as I realize that I was taking up the entire couch. I hear snickering, and realize that it's probably this boy's friends, because I don't have many in hufflepuff. "Hey, look at this picture!" An unfamiliar voice says with enthusiasm. "Oh man, I'm going to tease Adrien about this CONSTANTLY!" Squeals another. "Their ship name should be… ASHRIEN! My gosh, I'm a genius." Says the first again. I turn tomato red. I notice this 'Adrien' is waking up. I scramble to get into a sleeping position. "Euhahh!" Says Adrien as he wakes up and notices me. He gets up and runs down the hall where his friends are. "Look what we found!" They said in unison. Then, I pretend to wake up and I peek over at them. It seems like Adrien noticed me, because he just then said "Let's talk about this elsewhere!" They all shuffled to the boy's dorm, leaving me in an empty common room. "Humph! Well, he could have at least greeted me!" I say, Brooding that I didn't really get to talk to him. It was the evening before halloween, at about 2:00. Classes were out early so we have time to… 'trick or treat.' So, basically, the teachers were positioned in different classes or left a bowl of candy, be it muggle candy or wizard candies.
