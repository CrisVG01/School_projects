be held this weekend at his house, where Pettigrews late mother was also buried." Without even stopping to try and figure everything out, he fervently continued searching the following articles. After reading through the rushed Death Eater Trials, which seemed like the only positive in the entire mess, there thankfully wasn't anything important until the issues starting in 1991. "BOY-WHO-LIVED HARRY POTTER FOLLOWS HIS PARENTS INTO HOUSE OF THE BRAVE AND NOBLE!" He didn't even bother reading that one, it was obviously only filled with gossip and not any useful information, so he continued on. "CURSE OF THE DADA POSITION STRIKES AGAIN! TEACHER GONE ROGUE STOPPED BY BOY-WHO-LIVED!" "On the final day of exams, Quirrinus Quirrel, this years Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, tried to steal a magical artifact from the halls of Hogwarts. While it is unknown what that object was, sources from inside Hogwarts revealed 'Headmaster Dumbledore warned that anyone who went to the third floor corridor would die a painful death, its obvious that that's where this artifact was hidden. I bet that Dumbledore knew someone would try to steal it and gave that warning knowing the thief would get caught. I just can't believe it was Professor Quirrel, all year the man had been stuttering like crazy and jumping at his own shadow.' If the former DADA professor had been able to fool everyone all year, he probably would have been able to get away with it too, if it wasn't for Harry Potter and a couple of his friends. It was hard to find out exactly what had happened, but the Boy-Who-Lived ended up in the infirmary overnight and Quirrel passed away due to his injuries. The magical artifact was saved and Gryffindor gained 160 points in recognition of the heroics of the students involved. Coincidentally, this sudden increase in points completely changed the rankings of the House Point system, putting Gryffindor in first place and therefore winning the House Cup. This marks the end of the almost tyrannical hold Slytherin house had held over the Cup for the last few years, and is a good change for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. We can only hope that Gryffindor House will continue their efforts, especially now that Harry Potter is a member." Absolutely sick of this, but still needing to know as much as he could find, he resumed his reading. It was more than a year later when his mind really went into shock, he didn't care about the raids or the Muggle Protection Act trying to get passed, he only cared about one thing at the moment: the article reading, "HOGWARTS FABLED CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED! CAT FOUND PETRIFIED!" Too panicked to read the articles, he looked at the next newspaper. There was one only a couple months later, "MUGGLEBORN STUDENT FOUND PETRIFIED! ARE OTHER MUGGLEBORNS AT HOGWARTS 'ENEMIES OF THE HEIR?'" His wand and light source was shaking slightly when he found the next headline, "ANOTHER STUDENT AND GHOST PETRIFIED! HARRY POTTER REVEALED TO BE A PARSELMOUTH! IS THE BOY-WHO-LIVED GOING DARK?!" A sick sense of dread was starting to wash over him at the next article, "DOUBLE PETRIFICATION BREAKS FINAL STRAW! HOGWARTS UNDER LOCKDOWN UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!" Then, "GROUNDSKEEPER RUBEUS HAGRID IN AZKABAN FOR BEING HEIR OF SLYTHERIN! BOARD OF GOVENORS SUSPENDS DUMBLEDORE!" Slightly placated, he read the next one. "CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN CLOSED! HAGRID PARDONED AND DUMBLEDORE REINSTATED AS HEADMASTER! BOY-WHO-LIVED SAVES THE DAY AGAIN BY DESTROYING DARK ARTIFACT RESPONSIBLE FOR PETRIFICATIONS!" To his dismay, there was nothing else important on the subject, and nothing interesting until July of 1993. "UNPRECEDENTED FEAT! SIRIUS BLACK BREAKS OUT OF AZKABAN!" After that, nothing besides updates on Blacks whereabouts. It seemed like there was nothing after August, so he assumed that therefore he must be in the year 1993. He checked the time, and noticed that the glamour and notice-me-not charms he had placed were probably going to vanish soon, so he decided to head back to the Hospital Wing. He didn't know what had happened to put him there, but thankfully he was completely healed from it. Not much else was able to process in his mind, however. Too much information in too little time added with multiple extreme emotions in the middle of the night did not mix well. Disarming the charms he had put around his bed, he got back under the covers. Funnily, just being in a bed helped calm him down, so he was able to think properly. So it seems like I've landed myself in the body of my prophesied enemy, Harry Potter, who is also now known as the 'Boy-Who-Lived'. And if my math is correct, he is 13 years old, as well as in Gryffindor House. Even further, most of my Death Eaters have been in Azkaban for the past 12 years, and only Merlin knows how that has affected them. To make matters worse, I still don't know what happened to me that Halloween night or what caused my soul to awaken in Potters body now of all times. Worst of all, somehow my diary got into the hands of some student only to get destroyed by the very same person I'm inhabiting. And I don't doubt that Dumbledore has it now, so it's only a matter of time before he figures out what it is, so I need to move the rest of my horcruxes to safer locations instead of sentimental ones. Now if I could just get all these problems resolved within the next few months I would be satisfied, but since Harry Potter still has the Trace, and is extremely recognizable, I have to wait. Which means that I have to masquerade as a teenage Gryffindor... Great. Dreading the future, the soul of Lord Voldemort now residing in Harry Potters body quickly fell asleep from exhaustion. AN: I hope you enjoyed the first chapter of my new story, next update will be in a week!
