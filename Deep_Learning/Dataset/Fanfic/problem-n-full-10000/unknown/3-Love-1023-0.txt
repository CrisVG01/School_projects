She's a teacher, I thought nervously. It's not like she's going to hurt me. "If that's the case than I am a satyr" said Thalia crossing her arms. I said, "I'll-I'll try harder, ma'am." Thunder shook the building. "We are not fools, Percy Jackson," Mrs. Dodds said. "It was only a matter of time before we found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain." I didn't know what she was talking about. All I could think of was that the teachers must've found the illegal stash of candy I'd been selling out of my dorm room. " Yah she is terrorizing you because you stole candy" said Demeter, her voice dripping in sarcasm. Or maybe they'd realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were going to make me read the book. "How is reading the book worse" asked Annabeth. "For you it isn't but for us it is the worst thing ever" said Leo while Percy, Nico, Travis and Conner nodded in agreement. "Boys" muttered Annabeth rolling her eyes. "Well?" she demanded. "Ma'am, I don't..." "Your time is up," she hissed. Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn't human. She was a shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to ribbons. "Yup it's Alecto" said Nico smirking. "What! You sent a fury after my son" yelled Poseidon at Hades. Ares rubbed his hands , waiting for a good fight. On the other hand Apollo, Hermes and Hephaestus ran to keep Poseidon down. "It happens in the future, I don't know why I send it" Said Hades. Then things got even stranger. "How can things get stranger?" asked Jason. Mr. Brunner, who'd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into the Doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. "What ho, Percy!" he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air. Mrs. Dodds lunged at me. Everyone was quiet and was sitting on the edge of their chairs wanting to know what would happen and Poseidon was turning into a puddle because he was very worried of his son's condition. With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn't a pen anymore. It was a sword-Mr. Brunner's bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day. "Chiron took Riptide to school!" said Annabeth. "It could have been very dangerous" answered Jason. Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes. My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword. She snarled, "Die, honey!" And she flew straight at me. Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the sword. "That came naturally to you?" asked Nico in amazement. While Percy just shrugged. The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of water. Hisss! Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me. "That is creepy" said Thalia shivering. I was alone. There was a ballpoint pen in my hand. Mr. Brunner wasn't there. Nobody was there but me. My hands were still trembling. My lunch must've been contaminated with magic mushrooms or some-thing. "Magic mushrooms? Where did you got that idea from" asked Nico. "The same place you get your ideas from" answered Percy. Had I imagined the whole thing? I went back outside. It had started to rain. Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy Bobofit was still standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she saw me, She said, "I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt." "Who?" said Nico. I said, "Who?" Everyone burst into laughter. "Nico got Percitis" yelled Leo. "Oww Beauty queen that hearts" as Piper had smacked him again. "Our teacher. Duh!" I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was talking about. She just rolled her eyes and turned away. I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was. He said, "Who?" But he paused first, and he wouldn't look at me, so I thought he was messing with me. "Grover is very bad at lying" said Annabeth. Travis took out a notebook and wrote Grover's name on it and also wrote lying lessons. "Not funny, man," I told him. "This is serious." Thunder boomed overhead. I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he'd never moved. I went over to him. He looked up, a little distracted. "Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson." "Look Chiron can lie" said Hermes. I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadn't even realized I was still holding it. "Sir," I said, "where's Mrs. Dodds?" He stared at me blankly. "Who?" "The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher." He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. "Percy, there is no Mrs. Dodds on this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yankee Academy. Are you feeling all right?" "Done" Annabeth said with a sigh. "With the book" said Apollo. "No the chapter stupid" replied Artemis. "Who will read" asked Annabeth. "I'll read" said Thalia snatching the book from Annabeth.
