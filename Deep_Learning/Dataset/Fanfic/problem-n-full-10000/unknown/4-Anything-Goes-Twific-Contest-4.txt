points towards the school. "Like, screaming and crying in at her locker." I stick to biting large chunks of my apple, the sweet fruit clogging un my throat. Angela snorts. "What, did she break a nail?" "Nah, Edward ditched her ass." Ben chuckles. My apple falls to the grass, forgotten. I stare towards the school as Angela stares at me, wide eyed. "Apparently he got sick of her shit, doesn't want her hanging on him when he goes off to college or something." Ben shrugs, digging through his bag for lunch. "Ben, could you go grab me a soda?" Ang asks him. "I just got here." He huffs, but relents when she gives him a pout. As soon as he's out of earshot, she pounces. "Why are you still sitting here?" She asks, waving her hand towards the school. "Go! Go get him, dude." "No," I shake my head. "I can't." "Bullshit." "It's been two months, Angela." I shake my head. "He hasn't called me in two months." "Maybe he wanted to." She hedges. "What if he did it for you? Broke up with her to be with you?" "Then he'd be here," I snap. "He'd be out here, right now. Or he'd call. But he hasn't. He didn't do this for me, okay? He did this for himself." "Okay." She mumbles. "Sorry," I sigh. "Look, it's fine. He did the right thing. He wanted to go off and be different from who he is now. Maybe, this is the start of that for him." "Do you still love him?" Angela asks softly. Yes. "I just want him to be happy. Now he can be." . . . I was packing up the last of my bedroom today, and now it's so so bare. The bed we lay on, touching, talking, fucking, is now devoid of it's usual purple sheets. The little drawings and notes you hung up on my picture board are packed away in a box. A hoodie you left here is in my one of my suitcases. The only evidence to prove you were ever in this small room with me, is the small blue lighter sitting on my nightstand. I've had it for a few weeks now, and comtemplated keeping it. This small, insignificant part of you. But I'll just give it to Angela to pass along to you. I don't need a lighter. You're memory is locked in my heart. . . . I feel a tap on my shoulder and turn to find Edward standing nervously behind me. Heart stoppingly beautiful, even with the ugly yellow graduation robe we're both wearing. His green eyes are boring down on me, sucking all the breath from my body. He looks nervous. "Happy graduation." He nods. "Yeah, you too." I say, awkwardly. "Where's your dad?" He asks. I point behind me, to where Charlie is talking to Mr Newton with the biggest smile on his face. "Flaunting me out one last time before I leave." Edward laughs lightly, and I smile for the first time in weeks. "Where are your parent's?" I ask. "Over there," He points to his dad. "Mom went to talk to Mr Banner, and dad's sulking." "Why ? You just graduated, shouldn't he be proud?" I frown. "Yeah, well." He shrugs. "I told him last night where I'm gonna go to study." "Oh yeah?" "Yeah, I uh..." He smirks. "I got a scholarship to study music at Juilliard." "What?" I nearly yell. "Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?" "Yeah, they sent my acceptance letter a few weeks ago." He tells me bashfully, but the smiirk is still in place. "Holy shit." I laugh breathlessly. "Edward, that's amazing. Really." "Thanks." He nods. "So you're headed to...?" "Seattle, yeah." I shrug. "Going into psychology." "Wow, that's cool." "Yep." I purse my lips, looking around. Rosalie Hale is glaring at us from across the gym. "Can we talk, later?" Edward asks quietly, eyes downcast. "I...I'm leaving. After this, we're headed to the airport." I whisper. " Shit ." Edward looks up. "Seriously?" I nod. "Fuck. But I-" "Bells, you ready to go?" Charlie calls and I wave a hand toward him, my heart in my throat. "What were you going to say?" I ask Edward, who's now glaring at the ground. "Nothing, I just..." "What?" I step closer. "Tell me." He shakes his head, and then I'm in his arms. He hugs me so tight with one arm around my waist, the other buried in my hair. I breathe him in, my hand gripping him at the waist. "Be happy, Bella. Okay? No matter what?" He whispers into my neck, placing a small kiss there. "I will." I tell him shakily. Then the warmth of his body dissappears, and I'm watching his back as he marches away from me. . . . I was supposed to leave ten minutes ago. Charlie's waiting for me by the car but I darted into the girls bathroom just so I could write this. Edward, what was once my journal has become a chronicle of our relationship. A personal book dedicated to you. It has all of my thoughts and feelings written on these lined pages. Everything I felt I couldn't say to you is in here. If you've ever wondered what was going through my head, this is it. It's all in here. You'll find out how much you really mean to me. I saw you're drivers side window was opened just a small sliver. So, I'll slip this journal inside and hope you find it. I'll hold onto the hope that this could be a new start for us. Maybe you'll come back to me, maybe not. But I hope you'll be happy, too. Wherever you go, and whatever you choose to do after reading this. I hope you find the life and love you so deserve. And never lose that aura of cool you have, because that's a true part of who you are. Love, Bella.
