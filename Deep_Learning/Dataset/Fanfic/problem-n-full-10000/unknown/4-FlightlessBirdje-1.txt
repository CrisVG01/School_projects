a novella. She was inside in the kitchen and left the door open. I just simply walked inside, talked with her and the moment she turned her back to me I grasped her. Immediately I put a chloroform drenched tissue on her mouth and she was out like a light in seconds. I never touched a thing inside the house, so the cops wouldn't find fingerprints or anything else. I had been very careful in executing my plan.. I threw her over my shoulder and walked back to my special created room where I laid her on the bed. I locked the chain on her ankle and tugged on it, making sure it was securely attached.. I turned on the lights, closed the door and went back into my normal routine. That night I even helped searching for her, fooling everybody. Everyone trusted me, which only helped my plans. C.L.: So now you had herâ€¦ What happened next? J.W.: I watched her on screen and I brought her food and water. When she slept I watched her sleeping in the room, I mixed some sleeping pills in her food to keep her relaxed. After a few weeks I lost my job, they said I 'lost my focus and concentration' What a lousy excuse! I was so angry I made her my boxing ball... It wasn't my intension at first but after a while it felt so good hitting her. Just a way to release my anger. It became a habit: when I got frustrated.. I would hit her. Then after she fell asleep I would masturbate while watching her. That was our routine till you arrested me. C.L.: So you are saying you only watched and beat / kicked her, never anything else? J.W.: Yes, that is what I am saying. C.L.: Why? J.W.: Why what? C.L.: Why did you do it? J.W.: I don't know, it was a need that overtook me.. I needed the presence of her beauty. C.L: If we had not arrested you, would you ever have let her go? Or would you hurt her more.. maybe even raped her? Or murdered her? J.W.: Probably both. C.L.: OK, let's take a break. ********************Taken******************** It had been six months since Bella was rescued, she is going back to school now. Her wounds have all healed physically, she is seeing to a shrink for her other 'wounds'... I make sure she gets there and back home. Together with Charlie and my parents, one of us always is with her on the lookout and just to be sure... she is still afraid of being alone. I sleep in her room, with the door open. Charlie wasn't too pleased with this arrangement , but Bella wanted it so he relented. Het trust in me is huge, she sometimes comes to my bed to snuggle with me. She even kissed me once; that was yesterday, Bella even begins to smile again. Charlie has found a new job, which was one of the reasons I get to stay with Bella at night. None of us felt at ease at the thought of her being alone at night, least of all Bella herself. ********************Taken******************** Dear me, I am free, I feel free...almost I am still afraid of being alone. But Edward makes me feel stronger. He sleeps in my room, so that I won't have to be afraid of the dark. Dad found a new job. And when he is working I am at Edward's home or Edward is with me. I kissed him...when I snuggled with him in his bed...sometimes I just need to feel his warmth and his strong arms around me. I still haven't told him I love him... I think that will happen soon... he is my safe haven. I still have to tell him the whole story. But I am scared he will see me as broken when I do. Now he still looks at me with love in his eyes... I am afraid that will change then. But I need to tell him, tell him he was the one who kept me sane. I fought for him. ******************** Taken ******************** It took her eight months to get the nerve to finally tell me everything. I knew it was bad, but this was really bad.. I am so proud of her, for her to tell me. And as a bonus she told me she loves me, she made me so happy. Ever since she told me, we are becoming closer to one other. She hugs and kisses me on every opportunity and she seems more free from the fear that lingers in her mind. Even Charlie seems to notice a difference in her being. We both graduated high school, with a halve year extra time due to her kidnapping. We will be going to college after the summer break. This gives us some free time to find an apartment near college and to buy all the things we need to fill it. Yes, we are going to live together and yes, our parents think it is OK. ******************** Taken ******************** Yes, I told him everything and confessed my love for him. It turns out to be the best thing ever. We are closer than ever.. going to live together and attend the same college too. Our parents are ok with it. I feel better, I can see more clearly and analyze my fear and work on it. James has been sentenced to 40 years in prison. That too makes me feel safer. Now I know he can't come back after me. I did go to him in prison to talk to him, Edward was with me, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. James looked so small and not the animal he once was to me. He cried and told me he was sorry. I don't know if I can believe him but it helped me concur the fear. I will be fine, we will be fine.
