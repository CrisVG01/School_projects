think about Bianca. She realized Bianca would be lost. Forever. She tried to mask off the grief with a stern look. "We sensed too much monster activity over here. Lady Artemis marched, along with some of our other hunters to another spot. So... Yeah!" "Hmm..." Annabeth nodded, trying to focus on what was happening. Luke, Charlie and Zoe were staring at their unconscious sister, their faces very sad. Percy felt very bad, looking at his kids in such a horrible state. He wanted to strangle Apollo for reciting such a horrible prophecy. But, that was something the Fates did. Lives of demigods never ended happily. "Bianca is regaining her consciousness!" Will announced, moving towards the conference held by the hunters and Percy, Annabeth and Nico. He actually felt bad after looking at the kids' faces. He wished their future was less painful. "Mom!" Bianca called, trying to lift her head. Annabeth ran towards her, her face very serious. "I-I realized what the prophecy says!" She said, looking very weak. "What?!" She asked, trying to control herself from breaking down, after looking at her daughter. "Miss Grace..." She called. Annabeth looked at her, as Thalia walked towards the girl. She beckoned the Hunter to bend towards her and muttered something in her ears. "Its decided. This young maiden wishes to join the Hunt." Thalia announced. "What?! No Bianca! You can't do this!" Percy cried, stupefied. "Bianca!" Luke cried. He ran towards his sister, as tears rolled down his cheeks. Thalia moved as Luke sat in front of her. She smiled a bit, which made him feel very bad. "I am sorry Luke! You won't have anyone to fool! Zoe? Charlie? Spare them for some time!" She said, coughing. "Bianca! No! Please!" Luke sobbed, wanting to kill her sister for making such a stupid decision. "No Luke! This is my destiny!" She said. "Bu-" "No Luke! Don't make her change her decision." Thalia said. She put her hand on his shoulder. "Remove your hand." "What?" "DONT TAKE MY SISTER AWAY FROM ME! I HATE YOU!" Luke bellowed. He ran towards his father and began to cry very loudly, burying himself in his father's stomach. Thalia felt bad, but, they needed recruitments. Bianca looked very promising. She couldn't afford to lose her, just because she was her friends' daughter. Percy slowly stroked his hair, trying to calm him down, but, it was pretty useless. He didn't seem to pause for a breath as well. Annabeth was suddenly reminded of the way they fought in the car and felt happy, since they cared for each other. "Bianca! Are you sure?" Charlie asked. Bianca looked up at Thalia, as if asking her to explain. "Bianca is one of mine, now!" Thalia said. She summoned a few of her hunters, and they tried carrying Bianca on their shoulders. They walked towards the other hunters waiting for them. "Bianca!" Nico shouted. The hunters, who had already reached their hunters, turned back. "Bianca! Please think about it again!" He cried. Percy realized how Nico must've felt, since she had his sister's name. "No! I have thought about it! Thank you for your concern!" She said. They walked away towards the hunters, as Bianca didn't even bid them a final goodbye. "Dad!" Zoe cried. The three kids kept on sobbing. "Percy!" Nico called, as Will and Annabeth tried to calm down the kids. "Yes?" "What was the second part of the prophecy?" "Gain another one!" He replied, wiping the tears. "Don't worry. She is brave!" Nico said, patting him on his back. "Wait!" Annabeth said, standing up. "We need to search for someone. Some thing!" She said, as the kids, Percy, Nico and Will stared at her, wondering how she could think even in such a distressed situation. "Something is fishy!" She muttered, as they walked towards the car. "Will and I shall shadow-travel!" Nico said. "No more underworldy stuff. Doctor's orders!" Will shut him up. "I think the gods want us to do something." She said, as the weather surrounding them became cooler. Nico suddenly smelled something very pleasant. Percy felt like he wanted to kiss Annabeth. "Aphrodite!" Will said, as a figure walked towards them. "What?!" The others yelled. The kids gaped at the elders, not uttering a single word. "Well... Well..." She said, as doves fluttered around, which, Nico found very creepy. "Well Nico! Will is your one true love!" She announced. Nico blushed, as Will stared at him. "Why did you come here?" Percy asked. "Ohh! I actually made Apollo say a random prophecy. It doesn't exist!" She squealed, as she handed Annabeth something. When Annabeth saw what the goddess gave her, she was stunned. It was a baby girl, with lovely kaleidoscopic eyes and red hair. Her cheeks were red and she looked really cute. "A baby!" Annabeth whispered, as the baby tried to kick her. "What?" Nico asked "Well... This one is my new baby, fathered by this guy called Ryan Wellbeloved." She squealed. "Why're you giving her to us?!" Percy asked. "Her father died." She said. "An accident." Annabeth felt really sorry for the baby girl. She already began to like her. "What shall we name her?" Zoe asked. "Name her after your hunter daughter. Gah! How sad! I was planning for a love triangle!" She said. "Bianca!" Zoe cried. "Yeah! Bianca is back!" Nico said. "What was the 'Will is your true love' part?" Will asked, eyeing his man suspiciously. "Nico had some counts. I clarified his doubts." She said. "Aphrodite!" Annabeth called her. "Yes, darling?" "Apollo's prophecy is true. When you asked him to say a random prophecy, you actually made it true!" She said, looking at baby Bianca. "Annabeth! I have a feeling she'll make us proud one day!" Percy said, as they walked towards their car. Annabeth didn't listen for anything except for the baby's squeals. Life is so weird! It gives you one thing, as you lose one. Though life isn't fair. Sometimes it seems to be.
