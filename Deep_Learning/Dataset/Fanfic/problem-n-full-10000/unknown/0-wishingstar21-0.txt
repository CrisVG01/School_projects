sits with his Slytherin friends. And Lily slips into a compartment of Gryffindors, giving him a sad smile. They're all estranged. Regulus doesn't know who Severus sits with. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It's the second night back at Hogwarts when an owl arrives for Regulus at dinner. It's from Lily. I know we're back in school, she writes. But can we keep up our correspondence? They write every night after that. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . They keep writing, even though they hardly see each other. He knows when she dates James. He knows all the little things she found hilarious, what she spends her Saturdays doing. And when she graduates, it's him she smiles at as she gets her diploma. They keep writing all through Regulus' year. He laughs with her about his old attitude towards OWLs and NEWTs. But they don't see each other for over a year. After graduation, Lily suggests they meet up for ice cream, at Fortescues. I'd love to catch up in person, she writes. And he agrees. It's not as awkward as he thought it would be. They hug, and get their ice cream, then continue as if their letters were a part of a long conversation that they can now pick up when they see each other face to face. She asks about Severus. "I don't think we'll ever be great friends again," Regulus says. "But he's doing fine. Working as a Potions Master in France." She nods and licks her ice cream. "He liked you, you know," Regulus says. "Thought he loved you." "I know," she says. "But…he's not the one I liked." Regulus nods. Not long after, the ice cream's gone, and they make plans to meet again. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It comes on quietly. No big revelation, no pining the way Severus did. Regulus just looks at her on one of their little meet ups and knows. It's in the way she smiles when she sees him, the way she understands everything he says. The way he feels like he can tell her anything, and that she can solve any problem. That day, as they plan their next meet up, Regulus asks if she wanted it to be a date. "I'd like that," she says. They both part with smiles on their faces. Regulus' smile disappears as he apparates into his luxurious apartment. Sirius was disowned when he married the werewolf , Regulus thinks. I'm the sole heir. Will they – will they accept a muggle-born? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Regulus tells his parents ahead of time what Lily's heritage is. His mother is shocked. "I thought we raised you better than this!" she screeches. "You raised me to know quality from yesterday's trash," he says quietly, appealing to them both, father and mother. "And Lily – she may be muggle-born, but it doesn't hinder the understanding of this world, nor her intelligence in the many fields of magic." It's an uphill road, but after the third time they meet with her, they are thoroughly enchanted. Sirius throws a fit when he realises that Regulus won't be blasted off of the family tapestry the way he was. James throws a fit when he walks in on Regulus and Lily kissing in Lily's flat. "I thought you weren't with anyone!" he howls. "I thought you were taking a break from guys!" "That's the last excuse I used when he asked me out," Lily whispers to Regulus after James storms out. They laugh together over that. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . There are plenty of whispers at the wedding, but since Lily's parents are dead, it's quite easy to pass her off as a half-blood, which is what Walburga tries to do. "Inbreeding, you know," she says 'confidentially'. "It's best to bring in some new blood every once in a while." "Muggle blood?" A relative inquires snidely. "Magic blood," Walburga replies imperiously. Regulus refuses to play his mother's games. "My Lily is perfect the way she is," he tells anyone who asks about his bride's heritage. And as they swirl around the dance floor together, he kisses her, not caring who is watching. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Eighteen months later, Lily is bent over the toilet, cursing Regulus for doing this to her even as he holds her hair back and reminds her that she wanted a child. Six months after that, she holds a tiny baby boy in her arms, as Regulus holds her in his arms. "Name?" he asks softly, stroking the baby's tiny tuft of black hair and perfect skin. "Harry," Lily says. Regulus smiles. "Fine," he says. "But a star name too. Otherwise my mum will throw a fit." "Fine," Lily says. "Rigel." "Harry Rigel Black," Regulus says quietly. He kisses his wife, and then leans down to kiss the baby on the forehead. "Welcome to the wizarding world, my son." The baby opens his eyes, and Regulus smiles at the shocking green colour of them. "Like mother, like son," he murmurs. And that is the picture that their first family portrait is painted from. The three of them in a circle, the family resemblance between their child and his parent visible in the brilliant green eyes and jet black hair. Welcome to the wizarding world, Harry Rigel Black. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
