Greenleaf long under tree In joy thou has lived. Beware the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more." The words to Legolas frightened me. Will the call of the Sea overturn the love he holds for me? I thought, my eyes glancing at my fellow Elf as he strode beside me. "And to her Daughter: In the Winter thou were born, In the Spring thou rode away on a path unseen by me, To assist those as precious as the Spring to thee, And by Mid-Spring others upon thou no longer scorn, Also in the Late-Spring shall thou defend those precious to thee, In Spring thou shall follow thy love over the Sea." "Dark are Mother's words," I whispered, though I was relieved at the tidings of not losing Legolas. "And little do they mean to those that receive them," Legolas answered my voice, his hand clasping mine. "That is no comfort," said Gimli. "What then?" said Legolas, his grip on my hand now firm and tight. "Would you have her speak openly to you of your death?" "Yes, if she had nought else to say." "What is that?" Gandalf said, opening his eyes after closing them. "Your pardon, Gimli! I was pondering the other messages once again, but indeed she sent word to you, and neither are they dark nor sad. "'To Gimli son of Gloin,' she said, 'Give his Lady's greeting. Lock-bearer, wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee. But have a care to lay thine axe to the right tree!'" The Dwarf then became happy, and wished for a head that was right to cleave. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo We went back to the camp we had been in, and my saddle was gone. But this no one noticed. "They have not returned," said Legolas. "It will be a weary walk!" "I shall not walk. Time presses," said Gandalf, and he gave a long whistle that was clear and piercing. A whinny of two horses came to our ears on the winds, and then the sound of hooves, and soon four dots appeared on the edge of my sight. I stepped forward, and called back with a perfect mimic of the earlier whinny, causing one to break from the group and run towards me at full gallop, and as he neared me, I made out my saddle, and the beautiful black body of Shadowbane. 'Shadowbane... you are safe,' I whispered in my mind. 'Of course, Arieal. I promised you I would be. And I see you are as well,' he nickered as he checked his speed and trotted to my side and circled me, exhaling gently in my face before nuzzling my cheek as a white stallion trotted to Gandalf with Hasufel and Arod behind him. The great horse nuzzled Gandalf affectionately, and Hasufel and Arod walked to Legolas and Aragorn. "Shadowfax, Chief of the Mearas, lord of all horses, even of Shadowbane there," Gandalf said, and Shadowbane nodded. 'When Shadowfax called, I could not ignore him. As much as I wanted to stay with you, I had to go with him,' Shadowbane said, still nuzzling my cheek. "I understand, my friend," I said out loud by mistake, and soon everyone's eyes moved to me, wide in confusion. "Who are you speaking to?" Aragorn asked, after a pause. I sighed then answered, "Shadowbane." "How?" "Through our minds. He is a Meara after all, but he has lost human verbal speech. However, his mental speech still exists. That is how I was not carried away when the horses ran off in the night. He told me he was leaving," I explained. They were quiet for a moment, and then Legolas laughed, his mirth bringing a confused smile to my lips. "Now I understand a part of last night's riddle!" he said as he mounted Hasufel. "The reason you were able to spring from Shadowbane's back was because he had warned you of his leaving, and the horses ran to greet their chieftain, Shadowfax!" I smiled warmly, then mounted Shadowbane with graceful movements as I answered, "Yes, sweet Legolas, that is right. Shadowbane warned me of his leaving, and then signalled for me to leap from his back when the time came for him to go." "Enough. To Edoras we must hasten," Gandalf called, and he urged Shadowfax off at a good pace, though slow, for he believed that Arod and Hasufel would not keep up. Once we all passed only did he allow Shadowfax to go at his full speeds, and then we hastened to the Golden Halls of Theoden. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Part three of Legolas's Heart!
