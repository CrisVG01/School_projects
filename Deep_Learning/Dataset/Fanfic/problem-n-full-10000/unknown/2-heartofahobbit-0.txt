to it's aid. As these marchers broke rank, the others stopped, swaying dazed and disoriented by their fatigue and fear. "Yo...you there, get ya on back ta where ya belong" shouted one man as he gleefully uncoiled his whip to enforce his command. The whip snaked out and with a loud crack struck and wound it's way about the neck of the second marcher...the one who'd tried to help. With a cry the marcher was pulled off his feet and dragged back to his place in line, sobbing. The man with the whip swung his leg from his saddle and approached the fallen marcher with an ugly sneer on his hardened face. He kicked the dust covered heap at his feet "ah...this one's no good...let the vultures get it" . His eyes turned skyward to the trailing scavengers, he'd ensure they met no resistance with their prey, he raised his club high .... ****************************************************************************** Frodo swung his feet from the bed and stumbled blindly to the window....he clenched his eyes closed and grabbed his head to stop the vision....stop the pain. "No" he screamed eyes wide in terror. ****************************************************************************** The blond curls of the little girl were dyed red with her blood, her sightless eyes wide with the horror of her last moments. The Marchers moved on....line after line of stumbling children. The harsh shouts of men, cracking of whips and muffled sobs the only sounds that broke the stillness. ****************************************************************************** Frodo's eyes rolled back into his head as the agony of his last vision ripped a hole in his heart. "No" he sobbed as he collapsed to his knees. Sam's blood ran cold at the sound coming from behind the chamber door....he dropped the tray with a loud crash and heedless of the mess he'd left he burst into the chamber. At first his frantic eyes could not find that which they so desperately sought...a muffled sob caught his attention and he ran to his master huddled on the floor. He grabbed him by the upper arms and stared into eyes that were glazed with pain and terror...he shook him, wanting to pull him from his pain "Mr. Frodo" he whispered gently, not wanting to frighten him further. Enormous blue eyes pulled him into his private agony as he heard him whimper "No...not the children". Sam caught his master and held him hard as he collapsed. He laid him out carefully and shouted for the hallway page to bring him help. Sam felt the body of his master stiffen and tense as his muscles contracted and pulled his head and back into an arch. Frodo's eyes rolled back into his head as his muscles suddenly released their hold...then tightened again. Sam tried to still his master's thrashing body, but his stocky form was no match for the convulsions that ripped through the frail figure below him. For moments that stretched into forever Sam struggled to keep his friend from further harm...but each contorted spasm brought his thin body in contact with the hard world in which he lay. Sam cringed as he heard arms,legs and head hit the marble floor and as Frodo's seizure ended it left them both limp. Sam cried tears of relief. Aragorn ran into the room to find Sam cradling a limp and catatonic Frodo in his arms. He rushed to their side. He looked to Sam's tear stained face for permission then gently took Frodo up in his arms and laid him upon the still rumpled bed. He felt for a pulse and wiping the sweat from Frodo's face passed his hand over eyes that were glazed and unseeing. He carefully used thumb and forefinger to pull down the hobbit's eyelids and give him the appearance of peace. As he gently checked arms, legs and neck for injury he turned to a still shocked Sam. "What happened Sam?" he whispered. "I don't rightly know...I was coming up with his tea and there was a scream...I came in and he was kneeling, with his head in his hands..." Sam said and continued " I went ta him...I tried to help him from his fear and he looked to me like he was trying to climb into my soul...and he said..." Sam paused as he struggled to get it right "He what Sam, what did he say?" Aragorn prodded gently. "He...he said 'no, not the children' and then collapsed on me.." Sam paused to sit by his masters side and he carefully took his thin hand in his. "Then he started twitching and trashing his body ...he was so strong I jest couldn't hold him...I tried Aragorn but his body shook so..." Aragorn sought to reassure the sandy haired hobbit and said "you did all you could Sam..." Aragorn paused as his hands found several cracked ribs and he uttered a most unkingly curse in elvish before turning again to Sam. "Was there anything about his actions, perhaps earlier, or something he may have said that seemed unusual to you Sam?" He asked. Sam paused and looked thoughtful a moment before answering. "Now as you mention it Strider, he did ask me if you'd a spoken of any troubles outside the city walls." Aragorn continued to examine Frodo for injuries and his hands carefully checked his head and face. Never lifting his head from his task his eyes looked to Sam and he locked the warm brown hobbit eyes with his steely gaze as he began to speak. Just then his searching hands came in contact with something wet and warm. This newest discovery elicited another string of elvish that Sam was certain would not have found favor within the halls of Rivendell. In the ensuing rush to bind up Frodo's broken ribs and stitch the gash on the back of his head , Sam forgot to ask Aragorn what his gaze had meant. Aragorn did not forget, but after seeing to the bandaging and care of the injured hobbit, he left to seek Gandalf's counsel.
