toora loora lay." I surge into another piece with the skilled grace only practiced musicians can pull off. "With a hammer and nails and a fear of failure/ We are building a shed/ Between here and heaven/ Between the wait and the wedding/ For as long as we both shall be dead/ To the world beyond the boys and the girls/ Trying to keep us calm/ We can practice our lines 'til we're deaf and blind/ To ourselves to each other where it's/ Fall not winter/ Spring not summer/ Cool not cold/ And it's warm not hot/ Have we all forgotten that/ We're getting old/ With an arrow and bow and some seeds left to sow/ We are staking our claim/ On ground so fertile/ We forget who we've hurt along the way/ And reach out for a strange hand to hold/ Someone strong but not bold enough/ To tear down the wall/ 'Cause we're not lost enough to find the stars/ Aren't crossed why align the/ Why fall hard not soft into/ Fall not winter/ Spring not summer/ Cool not cold/ Where it's warm not hot/ Have we all forgotten that/ We're getting old/ Where it's fall not winter/ Spring not summer/ Cool not cold/ Where it's warm not hot/ Has everyone forgotten/ That we're getting old/ Where it's fall not winter/ Spring not summer/ Cool not cold/ Where it's warm not hot/ Have we all forgotten/ That we're getting old." The townsfolk break into an old, Rohirric ballad, swirling and twirling around each other. I lay down my fiddle in a safe place and watch the dancing. Even Éowyn and Théoden are enjoying the merriment. It gives me an idea. I spot my targets leaning against a wall, away from the festivities. "You know that to make merry, one must participate in the merry-making," I grin. The response I get is a mutual sigh. My smile falters a bit before I regain my composure to ask, "An lema? (long journey?)" "Very," Aragorn nods solemnly. "Then loosen up. Take a bath, dance, drink, socialize!" "A bath?" "Trust me, it is needed." "Very well," "Le merna salk? Do you want to dance? And I will personally drag all three of you out there no matter the answer." "I suppose my answer is yes," "As is mine," Legolas smiles. I thought him to be very serious, but this small smile proves otherwise. "I'm not much of a dancer," Gimli groans. "But I'll bet I'm better than an elf!" I grab Gimli's and Aragorn's hands, pulling them to the group of people with Legolas walking beside us. We're sucked into the children's dance area by Rhoryn pulling my skirts. "Who are they?" He asks, then points at Legolas. "He's a fairy too!" "Rhoryn this is Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli. Legolas is an elf, not a fairy." I laugh. Aragorn stoops beside the boy with a friendly grin. "I am Aragorn." He smiles. "What is your name?" "Hi Air-uh-gorn. I'm Rhoryn." Rhoryn says, suddenly shy, and he hides behind me. "Auntie Ren will you sing again?" "Not tonight, aier. But I'll stop by in the morning and sing a special song." I crouch, hugging him. He plays with my hair, pouting. "Please!" "Oh, alright, one more. But only one." "Hehe, yay!" "Now Rhoryn, can you do me a favor while I get my lute? Can you make sure Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn have fun? You see, they're not very good at having fun. This is a very important job, aier (short one). Only you can do it." "Okay!" The boy suddenly overcomes his shyness and grabs Aragorn's and Legolas's hands and, making sure Gimli follows; he introduces them to the other children. Some girls start braiding Gimli's beard and Legolas's hair while the boys launch into a tale I recognize instantly. The story I told them when they asked why I looked different from everyone else. A flare of anger surges through me, kindling my movements. My fingers strike a chord at random, and then they tickle a soft tune from my childhood. One that Lily and Bryn taught me. "Anírach únad/ Egor gurth hen/ Han cenin vi chen lín/ Egor ú-erin le devi/ Tellin men achae/ Brennin men anann/ Rago! Ú-erich leithio/ Ú-erich o nin gwanno. (You want nothing more than this death/ I see it in your eye/ But I cannot let you/ We have come too far/ We have held on too long/ Reach! You cannot let go/ You cannot leave me)," I care naught that the only ones who can understand me are two strangers. I don't even notice the silence in the room until I find myself outside in the same silence. I lean my lute and fiddle against the wall and lean against the railing, staring at the moon. Why did Lily and Bryn know Elvish? They were definitely human. Maybe my parents wrote the songs on the letter they had left with me? Unconsciously, my hand goes to the necklace I always wear. The only thing my birth parents left for me. They may still be alive... Have they ever tried to visit me? With a growl, I kick the wall. The physical pain fades quickly, leaving only a raw emotional pain. Tears build up in my eyes. Most only cry when frustrated, so what frustrates me? Or am I the exception, sad and alone and cold? Neither Miena nor Haiweth have seemed to notice my absence, for they would have come to comfort me if they had. Gaenyr is probably trying to keep Miena and Rhoryn from breaking something. My only other companions are the children, none of which are old enough to understand my sorrow. Of course there is Éowyn, but we haven't spoken in months. She has no reason to console me. I am alone in all senses. So terribly alone. But I learn that I am unfortunately not alone, for hands grab me, muffling my voice, and pulling me from the torchlight.
