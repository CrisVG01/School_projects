Parvati, "Not for them." "Then give the command, stupid girl!" shouted Master J, not realising just how inhuman he looked in that moment. Parvati looked at her parents again; they were wasting away. She looked around the dungeons at the prisoners, her people, and something suddenly snapped inside of her. With a trembling voice, she whispered "Genie of the lamp, I wish for my parents and people to be saved." The genie smiled. "Your wish is my command." "What are you doing?!" Master J. roared, the anger evident in his voice. "What I should have done long ago. Fighting you . I should have never listened to you in the first place!" Parvati shouted. "I thought you wanted revenge!" "I did," she said."And I still don't feel sorry that they suffered, but this is no way to live, not by hurting innocent people. It must end." "Too bad! I will not stop until I get what I want! Give me the lamp!" Master J. demanded, taking a few steps forward. "No!" Parvati clutched the lamp tightly, using her magic to transport herself to a meadow not far from the castle. She set the lamp down and fell to her knees, tears in her eyes. "What made you change your mind? You seemed pretty set on revenge," the genie asked gently. "I don't know. I saw how much everyone was suffering and I realised that my parents were right to fear us, me . Don't get me wrong, after how they've treated us, they deserve what they got, but I also made my people suffer. I should have protected them. I just wanted to find my sister, not to cause a war! I thought Master J. cared for me, but he just used me. What's worse, though, is that he's right. I'm evil. I can't fight it. I don't know what to do. I just want to find my sister!" Parvati sobbed. Unseen, Padma cried too, for she could do nothing to help her sister. At that moment, Fate smiled, and her destiny changed its course. A light engulfed Parvati. "My powers," she whispered, as it faded, "are gone." The genie smiled. "Now you are merely a princess." She smiled warily. "But how do I fight Master J? How do I save my kingdom? I can't just wish for all of those things. I need one to save my sister." "You can use your sister's ring." the genie said. "My sister's ring?" Parvati asked. "You see, I knew that I had been asked to trap the wrong sister. My master worded his wish poorly. I felt the link between her and the ring you are wearing now, so I let her be with you as a ghost. She was always with you." "But , how do I use it?" "Your sister is a natural sorceress. She can focus her magic into you. I can intervene too. I will help restore the kingdom to its original beauty and prosperity. You just need to word everything specifically enough," he said with a small smile. "Why are you helping us?" The genie looked her in the eyes. "At first it was because I wanted to defy my master but the truth is that Padma has been with me all of these years. I trapped her in the same realm I live in when I am not summoned by the lamp's possessor. As I am linked with the lamp, she is linked with the ring. We share the same reality. She is...my friend." Padma smiled. "And you are my friend too," came her whispered response. Parvati stood. "Okay. Let's do it. I can't stand the thought of him hurting my people any longer. I can do it. I know how he fights. He has been training me for the last ten years. Master J. won't expect me to change. I can surprise him and take him out," And so she did. She managed to defeat Master J, and cast him out of her kingdom, bringing peace again to the land of Agrabah. Then, she used her second wish to rebuild the city. Her parents were cast out by the people who rather preferred Parvati to be their queen than the disgraceful rulers who had shunned out their own daughters over a prophecy. "I think it's time for my third wish," she said, looking at the genie. "Whenever you are ready, Mistress." Parvati put her hand over his. "No, I'm not your mistress anymore. We're friends now." The genie smiled. "For my last wish, I want you to free my sister, I want her to have a body again and be healthy by my side. " The genie bowed. "Your wish is my command." Instantly, Padma appeared right near Parvati. The two sisters hugged each other, crying. "Thank you!" They both said to the genie. "It was my pleasure. Now, it's your turn to do something for me. I need you to hide my lamp well. There are many who wish to use my power for evil." "But," Padma started, "can't I wish for you to be free?" The genie shook his head. "No, it doesn't work like that. You and your sister are like one. No more wishes for you. Trust me, I'll be fine. I'm used to it. I just don't want to be a tool anymore." Parvati lightened up. "I have an idea. Take my ring. You said Padma was linked to it. This way we will always be connected. " It was decided. They took the lamp and the ring and put them in a cave far away from the castle and any prying eyes. Padma sealed the entrance to the cave with their blood so only those related to them could enter it. "I guess this is the end, sister,"said Padma. "We're free." Parvati shook her head. "No, this but a beginning my dear sister." Padma nodded. "You're right. It is indeed a beginning. A most happy beginning for us both."
