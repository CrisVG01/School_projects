wires from me. I hadn't realized how many I had. I lifted my hand with the tape, "What about this?" "That is an IV, sort of like the one in your leg. We don't have to disconnect that one, it can come with us." Rosalie answered as she hung the bag on a pole that was connected to the wheelchair. "Bella, I am going to lift you very carefully. I am going to try my hardest not to hurt you and if I do please tell me, I am not hurting you on purpose. Okay?" he asked. I nodded. I didn't have a choice. I was use to it but I didn't understand. At least with him, I knew what I was supposed to do. My purpose. My consequences. Burns. It burns as he lifts me, but a different type of burn. No. Sting, yes. It stings. I try to not show it. He apologizes. I don't say anything. He sits me in the chair. My legs are propped on to metal slates. "Here we go," Rosalie says as she pushes me to the bathroom. It's huge. There is an actual toilet and shower in there. I am weary. I don't understand. Rosalie turns on the sink water and lets it run while she pulls out towels and a gown from the closet. She tests the water, its probably going to be very hot. Burn. No. Please. She fills a tub with the water and adds some liquid stuff. There are bubbles. I smile. Bubbles, it slams me hard in the chest...a memory. Bubbles. ***FLASHBACK*** "ALICE! Oh no! What did you put in the dishwasher!?" I walked into her kitchen and the floor was covered in bubbles, up to my knees. "Just dish soap...AHH!" Alice came running into the kitchen and slipped, falling right on her butt. I start to laugh at her, "Dish soap? Hahahahaha!" I can't control my laughter. "My mom is going to be so pissed! Why did this happen?" She asked. "You are suppose to put this in the dishwasher," I said as I held up a detergent tab. "Not soap." "But why?" The look on her face was priceless, she was in utter shock. "Because THIS happens," splaying my palms towards the bubbles, "Have you ever ran a dishwasher before?" "Yeesss...but it's usually already to go; I just have to push start." Her cheeks flush red. I bend over, laughing uncontrollably. I picked up a handful of bubbles and blew them towards her. "My hair!" She screamed. She playfully pushes me into the bubbles...I push her back...bubbles, bubbles everywhere... Alice's mother walks in, Esme. We freeze. "What happened here?" We stay silent. She bursts into laughter... ***END OF FLASHBACK*** "Bella? Are you okay?" A frantic Rosalie interrupts me. What was that? Memory. No, I know no one. I frown. "Are you okay?" "Yes." No. I feel lost. "Do you feel okay to stand for a few moments?" I nod; she holds her hands out to help me. I grab them. She carefully lifts me up. "Hold onto this bar for support. Let me know if you need to sit back down." I nod again. She carefully unties my gown and removes it from my body. I see the shock in her eyes but she composes herself quickly. I refuse to look at myself, I close my eyes. "I am just going to use a washcloth and wipe you down a little bit, okay?" She asks. I nod again, eyes still closed. I feel the washcloth, burn. But no, wait. It doesn't burn. It's warm, it's nice. Rosalie is gentle. She is touching me. I don't mind. I know the burn will come. But I will wait. I will enjoy what little comfort this is, for now. She cleans under my arms, under my small breasts, and then between my legs. A small part of me is okay with this. Can I trust Rosalie? I do not know. No. I know no one. I can't trust anyone. But before I can ponder this much longer, I feel a cloth being draped over me. I open my eyes and look down. Rosalie has placed another gown on me and is tying it. "Okay, slowly we are going to sit down back down in the chair." I nod, she helps me. It stings but its okay. She tosses the washcloth in a blue bin and grabs another, wetting in the water. "I am going to wipe your face a little bit, is that okay?" I nod. I close my eyes. Again, it's warm. It's nice. "Barbara use to help me clean up after loving time sometimes, she didn't burn. Never burn, hurt yes. But never burned. I liked her. I think." I feel Rosalie stop. I open my eyes, she has tears in hers. "I'm sorry!" "Honey no, its okay. I am not upset with you. Sweetheart, those people that you were staying with, were not nice people, including Barbara. They did horrible things to you. You are safe now though, I promise. No more burning. I swear." "To the moon and back?" I ask, I do not know why. But I asked. She smiles, "Yes, to the moon and back. You have a lot of people that care for you deeply." I frown, "I am no one. I know no one." "You are Bella Swan, a beautiful, kind, strong person." I want to believe her but no. I am no one. So I nod and she finishes wiping off my face. "Feel better?" "Yes." And that is not a lie, I feel a lot better after I am cleaned up. My eyes start to droop. "Okay sweetie, let's get you back to bed." She pushes me back into my room. The fog was coming again. My eyes closed, "Bella, I am going to pick you up and put you back into bed." Carlisle spoke. "Okay." Sting, but it's okay. Soft. So tired. Covered up. Warm. Comfort. Blackness.
