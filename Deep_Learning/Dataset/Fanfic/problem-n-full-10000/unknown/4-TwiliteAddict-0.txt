You are more than the sum of your parts." "Maybe…maybe what I need is someone to foster me." Edward paused. He wasn't sure how Esme might react. Still, all that he had been through, he had journeyed full circle and was ready to give himself, if not to God, to the guidance of the individuals who had shown him unconditional love. "You have posed as my sister, but I need a mother. Esme, would you be that for me? At least until I am able to find my own way?" Esme beamed with joy, her light diluting his darkness. "Of course, Edward." Then she stood and pulled him to his feet. "Welcome home." . . Edward sat silently in Carlisle's study. He had sat there alone, silently awaiting Carlisle's return for an hour. Edward knew it would take much convincing and reconciling to win Carlisle's approval. Edward had overstepped his boundaries within their coven, and worse, within their family. He was in for a stern dressing-down. And he would take it, every word of it. Edward heard Carlisle's approach and not soon after, his thoughts. They were guarded and skeptical. Carlisle was afraid to believe his son was home. He was unwilling to have his heart broken a second time. Edward vowed to never let Carlisle down again. He would give Carlisle the respect he deserved, for Carlisle had earned it many times over. When the elder Cullen entered his study, smelling of antiseptic and clean cotton, Edward kept his eyes cast downward in a show of submission and repentance – and esteem for the head of his family and coven. Carlisle sat in his chair across from Edward. Edward knew he was being appraised, judged, but he dare not look up. Carlisle's mind was just as silent as his words. Edward rushed to fill the silence — "I am so sorry. For what I did to you, to Esme. I know I have no right to ask you to take me back but if you do, every day I will fight to be the person you have mentored me to be." Carlisle's chair creaked as he sat back and folded his hands in his lap. "Look at me, Edward." Edward raised his head and his eyes. He met Carlisle's intense stare. "What you have done will always be a part of you. You will have to reconcile that with yourself and who you want to be going forward. It will not be easy." Nothing could have been truer. "That voice — the voice of the killer. I hear it sometimes. Samael speaks, but I don't listen to him. It is you and Esme I will listen to —" But Edward stopped short. It appeared, although it could not see how, that Carlisle had gone paler than he thought possible for a vampire. His jaw twitched once, but it was enough to see Carlisle was unnerved. Edward's eyes narrowed. "That name. When I said Samael, you- Do you know him, Carlisle?" Without a word Carlisle flashed to his bookshelves. A moment of browsing was all he took before pulling a book from the shelf. It was a very old text from the look of the worn leather cover. All the while, Carlisle's mind repeated: It can ' t be. The anxiety coming from his unflappable creator had Edward on his feet. As Carlisle flipped through the dusty pages, Edward stood next to him. Carlisle pointed to the text under the heading: Samael. Edward read it aloud. "Samael in Hebrew means 'Venom of God.'" "Go on. Read more," Carlisle encouraged. "Samael is a powerful archangel who has had many roles, with the most well-known being that of destruction and death. He is skilled as an accuser and a seducer. In this way he had been compared to Satan as the embodiment of corruption and amorality. However, according to Hebrew lore, Samael is regarded as both good and evil as the executioner of death sentences decreed by God." Carlisle closed the book. He still appeared pale. "Edward, Esme told me you killed those who brought harm to others. Can it be that Samael seduced you to be his right hand in passing judgment? I'm left to question – were those deaths decreed by God?" Edward stepped backward until he stumbled dumbfounded in a chair. He was stunned beyond words. Had he been seduced by the angel of death to do his bidding? Or had he just been consumed by an addiction to human blood? Everything happens for a reason … . Carlisle's mind buzzed with confusion, but he continued steadfastly, "I cannot judge you, Edward. And I will not. But going forward, I need to know the voice in your head will not seduce you to commit murder of another human being. I cannot live every day of this eternity wondering if evil lurks under your skin, under my roof. Please, tell me I can trust you once again." Edward knew the voice of Samael would be something he would hear again. He had let it in, and it would not willingly leave. The life Carlisle asked him to lead had never been effortless. But now, the difference was Edward knew his worth – as a beloved son to Carlisle and Esme. As someone who was, and would again be, worthy of love. Someone who would one day find someone to love him as a mate. Until then, he vowed to let no one else in. AN: Thank you so much for reading.
