You shall be eee-jected !" I rolled my eyes inwardly. I never really liked these two baboons, really, most especially Dr. Thorn. He gives me the creeps and goosebumps! "Dr. Thorn, I just said that they are students in Westover Hall," I said with a bit of force. He narrowed his eyes at me. "Well then, let us ask Ms. Gottschalk!" he said, facing the principal. Just then, Thalia decided to step in. She snapped her fingers, and I suddenly felt a gust of wind. "We're not visitors, Dr. Thorn," she said. "We go to school here, Ms. Gottschalk. You remember: I'm Thalia, and this is Annabeth and Percy. We're in the eighth grade," Thalia said. For a second, Ms. Gottschalk suddenly looked dazed. "Oh… yes, yes you're right. I do recognize you three. Why aren't you in the gymnasium? You as well, Ms. Jackson," she said. Before we could answer, Grover suddenly came in, running and looking at Percy and his friends. "You made it! You—" he froze when he saw the two teachers. "Oh, Ms. Gottschalk, Dr. Thorn! I, uh—" "What is it, Mr. Underwood," Dr. Thorn said with distaste. The vice principal never liked Grover, and I didn't exactly know why, but I never pried in Grover's business. "What do you mean, they made it? These students live here," he said, as if he were challenging Grover. I decided to step in for my friend. "What Grover means, Dr. Thorn, is that… Percy, Annabeth and Thalia made the ski cap! Grover asked them to make one for him two months ago and I'm wearing his right now! Percy's not done with mine yet so I asked if I could borrow Grover's!" I lied, scurrying to Grover and pulling my ski cap off my head and his red cap off his head, placing my ski cap on his head. "Warm and cozy, right Grover ?" I said, flashing him a look to go with my story. He nodded shakily. "Uh—yeah! Yeah, really cozy!" he said, patting the ski cap on his head. "Well, anyways," Ms. Gottschalk said, clearing her throat. "Off to the gymnasium, you five! You are not to leave the gymnasium, alright?" she said. We nodded and scurried away, saluting and etcetera. Once we were out of sight, Grover faced me and gave me a big hug, earning an "oomph!" from me. "Thank the gods you were there covering for them! Thanks Calla!" he cried. I laughed and patted his head, grabbing my ski cap again and placing his red cap on his head. I faced Thalia, Annabeth and Percy. "You guys aren't students here in Westover High, am I right?" I asked. Grover sighed and shook his head. "No, they're not," he answered. I sighed. "Then for goodness' sake, what the heck is going on?" I asked him. He sighed, grabbing my hand and leading us to the gymnasium. "I'll explain later," he told me. Annabeth suddenly narrowed her eyes at him. "Wait, don't tell me you'll be telling her about…" she trailed off. Grover sighed. "She's… one of us," he explained. I raised an eyebrow at them, confused with their conversation. Her eyes widened in surprise, looking at me with a shocked expression. "Umm… what did I do?" I asked. Percy patted my shoulder. "We'll tell you later. Anyway, what's the emergency, Grover?" Percy asked as they trailed off with their confusing conversation. Grover took a deep breath. "I found three." "Three half-bloods? Here?" Thalia asked in surprise and amazement. Grover nodded. "You met the first one, " he explained, looking at me. I raised an eyebrow. "What? Are you telling me I'm a half-wambo?" I asked. "Half- blood ," Annabeth corrected. "Yeah, that," I said, facing Grover. He nodded. "I'll be explaining the details to you later. But the other two are brother and sister," he continued. "They're ten and twelve. I don't know their parentage but they're strong. We're running out of time, though. I need help." I raised an eyebrow. There's only one pair of siblings here in Westover Hall. "Wait, are you talking about…" Grover nodded. "Nico and Bianca," he said. I was shocked. I knew Bianca because she helped me with some stuff. We're not that close, but we can consider each other as acquaintances. Nico and I were much closer, though. "You know them?" Annabeth asked. "Well, I know them both, but I'm closer with the brother," I explained. "Are there monsters?" Percy asked. I looked at them incredulously. What the… what is up with this nonsense?! "One," he said nervously. "He suspects. I don't think he's positive yet, but this is the last day of term. I'm sure he won't let them leave campus without finding out. It may be our last chance! Every time I try to get close to them, he's always there, blocking me. I don't know what to do!" Grover cried, looking at Thalia desperately. "Right," she said. "These half-bloods are at the dance?" what is up with these half-blood mumbo-jumbos! "Yeah," he said. "Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Hold on," I said. "Are you telling me Bianca and Nico are part of this… thing you have?" I asked Grover. He nodded. Oo-kay, this is getting weirder and weirder . "Then, let's dance," Thalia said. "Well, while you guys are doing that, can I go to the library?" I asked. Grover shook his head. "You need to stay close with us," he stated. I sighed. "Anyway, who's the monster?" Percy asked. "Oh," Grover said, looking around the hallways nervously. Annabeth raised an eyebrow "What?" she asked. "You just met him," he said. I raised an eyebrow. "Ms. Gottschalk?" I asked, biting my tongue to keep myself from laughing. Wow, that is so possible! Sadly, Grover shook his head. "No. It's the vice principal, Dr. Thorn." xXx YAY! :D Done with my first rewrite :)) Hopefully, this one's a bit better than the previous one :( So, R&R and I'll be updating soon! :D ~miramisa90212
