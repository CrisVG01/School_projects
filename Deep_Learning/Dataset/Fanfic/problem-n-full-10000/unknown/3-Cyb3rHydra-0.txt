up, he was glaring at me. "What took you?" He asks. "Archery." I say. He grumbles under his breath. "Unlike you could do anything like it." "You think?" He asks. "I. Hate. You." I say. "Well... You'd better follow my instructions. Kill them. OR ELSE. THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE." "No. The camp protects me better than you do." "Then you have no use to me." He says. He waves his hand. The room explodes. I attempt to stop the explosion, but I feel a force working against me. Our eyes both glow gold. Then my energy shatters. I crash backwards. He grins and disappears. My eyes close, and I hear voices. Water drenches me. "Celestial bronze explosion..." They say. "It's going to take a few days to fix..." There's suddenly a voice inside my head. "You will stay here for all eternity." It's Kronos. "What do you want?" I think back at him. Wow. A mental conversation with my dad. I'm going insane. I black out. "This is another blackout. This will haunt your quest." Kronos says. "For now... You're stuck here." "You know what? I'll disintegrate your soul completely. I'm getting annoyed." I say, and hold out my scythe. "Doesn't work on me." He says. "It's mine." "This will." I say. I snap the scythe over my knee. "Try controlling this." I say. I throw my scythe at him. He tries to freeze time, but I speed it up, so time remains still. The scythe vaporizes him. "Sorry." I say. I wake up. I've been out for a second. I touch both sides of the scythe together and it immediately fixes itself. Now Kronos' soul is trapped inside. I sit up. Percy and Annabeth come over. "You were-" Annabeth says. "Yeah." I say. Percy holds out a hand, and I grab it and get up. Strange. The left half of my body is completely unscathed. The right side is bloody and bruised. I guess Kronos really did want to keep me in that chamber forever. I take some ambrosia out of my pocket and chomp it down. Immediately, my cuts begin to heal. I hear Damon shout, "Hey! Avian! We're leaving soon." "Kay." I reply and head over to the hill. They're all waiting for me. Quillin is holding a new axe. "Like it?" He asks. "It's cool." I answer. "So... how are we planning to get there? I think it's going to be greenland; I heard rumors about something causing trouble there." "Yeah..." Emilia says. "Wasn't that a freak blizzard-fire tornado thingy?" "Oh my gods." Says Lily. "Let's get going." Suddenly, the ground rumbles and a full size minivan pops out of the ground. It's completely made out of bedrock. "I'll drive." Says Damon. Clarisse is heading over the hill, looking to punch someone. Then she sees our murderous faces and runs. It's been a few hours since we began making way for Greenland. I hear a screeching sound, and immediately recognize monster. I hear something embed itself in the back of the car. Immediately, Quillin cries out, and I can see a small spike implanted in the car seat. I slam the door open and I'm immediately face to face with a group of spikes. I freeze time and back away from them. I see a dirt wall form between us and the monster. I get a glance of it. It's a manticore. No, three of them. I see a spike jut up from the ground, but the monster reacts with incredible speed and dodges. I duck past the barrier and sneak behind them. Immediately, I'm showered with spikes. Only one hits, but it leaves a mark along my right arm. I stumble in pain and throw my scythe. It hits one of them, and it immediately disintegrates it. Then the world turns over. I feel a weight push me over, and claws dig into my arms. "You're dead." It growls. It pushes its claws into my arms and bites at my face. I roll my head left to avoid instant death. "Any last words?" "Um... yeah. YOU'RE dead." I retort. Then I unleash a blast of energy from my body that vaporizes him immediately. I watch a rock spire skewer the other manticore. A layer of dust covers me. I check my wounds. I had a bad scar on my face, but that would heal. Then the claw marks on my arms. They had not pierced my skin, so i could relax. "You OK?" Alessia says. "Fine." I reply. A line of blood drips down my forehead, and I wipe it off. "Who's not?" "We'll all be ok, except for a few scratches. Drink some nectar." I do, and immediately, the bites begin to shrink into one really big scar. "Where are we?" I ask. "Maine. I remember this place... How is it night time already?" True. A few minutes ago, it had been noon. Time warp. I grip my scythe. Suddenly, the ground rumbles, and I hear one word; Deathmatch. "You hear that?" I ask. "Yeah." Alessia says. "We need to warn the others." Everyone has minor injuries. Little scarring. "You hear that?" Josh asks. "Yup." I reply. "Unless we're all going delirious." Something rumbles. A crack forms in the ground in front of us. I jump back to avoid debris that's flying out of the crack. "Look out! In front of you!" I yell. "Around us." Quillin corrects. We are surrounded. We all take out our weapons. "So many..." Damon says. "Alessia, get my back." I call. "Shut up." Says Josh. I look behind me. In that moment, I see a spear slash at my face. I duck, and it flies over me. The monster I see is a empousa. Suddenly, I see another blade behind it. Una appears behind it and slashes it into bits. "What are you doing here?" I ask. He grins. "I'm here to kill you." Just so you know, Una has an insane side, and this is it.
