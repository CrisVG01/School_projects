Rose and I?" "When?" "Tonight at 5:30." "I don't know." "Please?" "What if your family doesn't like me?" I put my hand on the side of his face and gave him a kiss. "They'll love you. Because you're special to me." I looked at him through heavy lashes. "How can I say no to that?" "You cant." I smiled, "That's the point!" he laughed. When we got to the mall, he parked and we got out. He grabbed my hand and we walked in holding hands. "What did you wanna show me?" "We're almost there." he said and squeezed my hand. He made us walk in the direction of Rogers Jewelers. I looked up at him and he smiled. We walked inside. "David, just on time!" a man behind the counter said. "Hey Jerry." David said. "Is this the lucky lady getting it?" Jerry asked. "Yeah, it's her." he smiled down at me. I smiled, clueless. "Close your eyes." he told me. I did as he said, I felt a cold chain around my neck and something handing from it. "Open." he whispered in my ear. I opened my eyes and a mirror was in front of me. I saw a silver necklace with a diamond pendant hanging off of it. I gasped. "David." I said shaking my head. "Do you like it?" he asked. I attacked his lips kissing him. "I love it." I said when we pulled apart. "I'm glad." he smiled and hugged me. "It looks beautiful on you." "This is unnecessary though." I said when we left the jewelers. "I was gonna give it to you anyways as an early birthday present." "You are the sweetest ever." he wrapped his arm around me. "So where to now?" "Well I was gonna take you out for lunch, but we only have three hours until dinner." we got to the parking lot. He helped me in the car then drove off. "Let's get some ice cream then I'll take you home so we can get ready." He drove to the ice cream parlor and paid for our sundays. After that he dropped me off at home and he went home. It took me and hour to get ready, I picked up Rose and the new went to get David. "Why is David coming?" she asked. "Because we're together." I said smiling. "Seriously?" she squealed. "Yeah. He asked me last night. He gave me this as an early birthday gift." I showed her my necklace. "It's beautiful." After we picked him up I drove to the restaurant. My family was already there waiting for us. We all ate together and they loved David. When it was over my grandparents each gave me cards with cash in them. I took Rose and David home then went home myself. The rest of the week was filled with graduation parties and getting mail from distant relatives with money inside. I eventually took al the money and put it in the bank. It came down to my last day before I had to leave. "Baby I'm gonna miss you so much." David said to me. "I'm gonna miss you too. Come visit me." I kissed him, I licked his bottom lip and he opened his mouth. I slid my tonge in and wrestled his. I licked the roof of his mouth and he shuddered. "Definitely coming to visit you." he smiled. "I look forward to it." "Come here." he opened his arms and hugged me tight. "Don't change, you are perfect the way you are. You are my Native American, Russian, Irish goddess. From your bright green eyes and your black curls to your olive skin and slight curves, I love it all." I starred at him in dissbelief. "You are unbelievable!" I said and a tear fell. "What?" he asked concerned. "It's so unfair for you to say that to me when I have to leave." he smiled. "I wont change, I promise." he kissed me again, sweetly. "If I don't go now, I never will." "Call me when you get there." "Of course." I smiled. I got in the car and he closed the door behind me. I started the car and drove off. "This better not be a mistake!" I said outloud. I turned on the radio and started my hour long journey to La Push. It wasn't that hard to find their house. I got out and saw a tan, muscular and sexy guy sitting on the front porch. ' Please don't be him, PLEASE don't be him!' I thought to myself. If he's my brother, then the thoughts that just ran through my head are taking me to hell! "I take it you're Seth?" I asked walking up to him. "No hun, you got the wrong guy." he looked me up and down. "Why would you want a guy like him anyways?" "Why? What's wrong with him?" "He's a bad seed. He does no good and no good comes from him. The best interest of a, pretty young thing like you would be to leave him alone. Now me on the other hand." he stood up, "I'm the right kind of bad." he smiled. "The right kind?" "Don't listen to this knuckle head." a similar looking guy said coming out of the house. He pushed the other guy off the porch. "Svetlana?" the other boy asked. "Yeah." "It's so nice to finally meet you. I'm Seth." I smiled. He walked down the steps and hugged me. "Mom!" he yelled, two girls came outside. "Svetlana, you look just like your mother!" the older of the two women said. "You know my mother?" I asked. "I've seen pictures." she said. "Introduce your self." she said nudging the girl next to her. "I'm Leah." she said. "Svetlana. But you could call me Sveta or Lana if you want." I smiled. "I'm Jacob!" the guy Seth pushed said standing up. "Hi." I smiled. "Back off." Seth said to Jacob. "She's my sister."
