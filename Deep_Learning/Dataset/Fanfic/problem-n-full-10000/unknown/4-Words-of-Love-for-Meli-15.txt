by now, reached the point of the song where the chorus sings, " The Führer is coming, the Führer is coming" , and as she was simultaneously thinking, "He's coming, he's coming" about her beautiful stranger. She was struck with the inappropriateness of the song's lyrics at this moment and started giggling. Nerves and anticipation turned her giggles into a snort and the laughter caused a quick involuntary jerk of her body, making her bike's front wheel abruptly turn sideways. Edward, a hundred yards away, looked on in horror as the object of his affection suddenly steered straight into the grass border next to the bike path. He sped up as the girl's wheel instantly became stuck in the muddy ground, stalling the bike and making it – and her – fall over sideways. There was nothing he could do but race towards her as her expression turned to shock and her head hit the wet grass. Her bike fell with her, landing on her leg and torso with little flair or noise, trapping her underneath it. Edward sped up his pace, thinking the worst – what if she was seriously injured? What if she broke her leg in that fall and why did she never wear a helmet? Not that he wore one, but then again, he had never randomly biked into the muddy grass. It took mere seconds of worrying before he reached her and found her – laughing out loud? Quickly discarding his bike, he wondered how to approach her now, and a part of him thought maybe she was in shock or hysterical or maybe just crazy. She was alternating between laughter and broken sentences that he couldn't quite make out, so he crouched down next to her. "Ha, ha, ha, ha, the - ha - Führer is ha, ha, coming oh God I can't even ha, ha the Führer is coming," she hiccupped-slash-laughed. Edward's brow furrowed because surely the 'she's crazy' conclusion wasn't the most likely one – and definitely not the one he had preferred – but it did seem probable now. He decided to stick with silence and gently lifted the bike off her body instead of talking. Bella seemed to be trapped in a laughing fit. As much as she wanted to either finally talk to the handsome guy or magically disappear, she had a hard time getting past the stupidity of her fall, the song that was still playing in her head, and the embarrassment at being caught by the gorgeous man in front of her. So she just clenched her eyes shut and went with what her body was telling her: laugh it out. Edward decided to wait it out – it wasn't as if this beautiful stranger could answer any questions right now anyway, and she seemed to be physically fine. Eventually, her laughter died down, and she stopped quoting songs that sounded incredibly inappropriate for the uninformed bystander. Bella took a deep breath and opened her eyes to find her handsome stranger looking at her with a worried expression. "Hi," she started. "I'm not crazy. Honestly." "Hi, not crazy, I'm Edward. Sorry – bad dad joke. Let me help you up." He took her hand and tugged her gently but firmly until they were both standing upright and in very, very close proximity. "Are you okay?" he asked, still tightly holding her hand as if he was worried she'd fly away if he let go. "Yeah," she breathed and she was rather amazed that she could still form a word. Even one as simple as 'yeah.' Because she'd just noticed that the handsome stranger she'd admired from afar was even more beautiful up close, and the feeling of his hand wrapping around hers made her feel tingly all over. "Um… so…" he started with an uncharacteristic lack of eloquence. "I kind of want to ask you out – or, more accurately, I've wanted to ask you out since the first time we drove by each other. But I have to ask first because honestly it's freaking me out a little bit – what's with the Führer thing?" Bella's response was a snort followed by a giggle. "I guess you've never seen The Producers?" "Can't say that I have, no… but I suppose it's a musical." "Ha! Caught the genre, heh? I know, I know, enough with the musicals. But hey – I did promise I'm not crazy, right?" He chuckled. "That you did." "So, how about you ask me out – because technically you haven't – and we'll watch The Producers , and I'll convince you that I'm a little too much into musicals but definitely not a neo nazi?" "Sounds perfect." "So….?" He looked puzzled. "What?" "Well, you did say you wanted to ask me out, but you still haven't, so I'm just waiting for a question I can say yes to." He laughed at that. It made sense that his singing girl was quirky and funny; she was just as interesting in reality as she'd been in his mind. "Fair enough. My lady, would you do me the honor of accompanying me on a… shit, what's an old-fashioned word for date? I don't know. Can I take you out sometime?" She giggled at his attempt at impersonating an old-fashioned gentleman. "Rendezvous? Call? Visit? Unchaperoned meeting? But, yes. You can take me out – but let's go watch a ridiculous musical movie at my place first. Come on, stranger." She winked at him and pulled her bike upright, starting to walk away from him. All he could do was follow. A/N well if I had a musical-loving Bella in my story and Meli had a musical-loving Bella in Without a Smile, obviously this had to be a silly story involving lots and lots of musicals. So there you go. Lyrics used: Touch-A Touch-A Touch Me - Rocky Horror Picture Show Popular - Wicked Wouldn't it be loverly - My Fair Lady Springtime for Hitler - The Producers
