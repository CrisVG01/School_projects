my life's liquid poured onto the floor of my bedroom. My hands shook as I pushed myself to stand and wobbled into the bathroom. What I saw in the mirror made me gasp. Blood streamed down my face, down my chest, dripping to the floor. My eyes filled with tears as I grabbed tissues and tried to stop the bleeding, to no avail. I realized that I would need stitches - the cut was nearly down to my teeth - and I had no way of getting them except…by asking my father. I shuddered. Creeping down the hall, I stared at my father's bedroom door. The slight crack in the door let light peer onto the space in front of me. Clutching my lips silently, I knocked on the door, my eyes filling with tears. The door whooshed open and my father stood in the doorway…. "Edward?" My eyes snapped to my left and I was met with a pair of large brown ones. My face felt oddly cold and it took me a second to realize the blood had drained from my head. "I'm sorry?" I asked, quietly. It was then that I began to feel the chilling prickle of numerous eyes on me. Glancing about myself, I saw everyone around the table staring at me with various different expressions. Bella and Alice stared at me with contemplation and confusion, Dr. Cullen with horrified concern, Chief Swan and Mr. and Mrs. Hale with plain annoyance, Mrs. Cullen with kind interest, Jasper with pity, and my father with warning. I flushed under the shade of my hair, looking down at my full plate, and muttered, "I, uh…I got hit in the face with a baseball bat." I saw my father's hands clench. Dr. Cullen's eyes flickered downwards at my father, noticing the movement as well and his eyes tightened noticeably. "How did that happen?" Dr. Cullen's voice was tight. "In baseball," I whispered. "I never played after that." Esme smiled warmly at me at that comment. "So…I had to get seven stitches across my lip. After that, I just got sick of seeing it. So, I pierced it." Carlisle's eyes narrowed further, "How did your father feel about that?" "He…he was mad, but he got over it I guess." I looked down, feeling the blood leave my face again. I was 14. My eyes stared back at me angrily as I stared into the bathroom mirror holding a needle to my lower lip. In my hand was a tiny silver lip ring that Jasper had given me the night before. In front of me on the counter was a bottle of disinfectant and rubbing alcohol; Jasper had told me to pour it on the wound at least twice a day to make sure it didn't get infected. He wished me the best of luck. But I was angry. I couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to shove the needle through my own skin. "Just do it!" I yelled at myself. Closing my eyes, I yanked my lip downward and jammed the little piece of metal through my flesh. I clenched my teeth waiting for the pain to subside. Eventually, I looked at the needle, sticking through my lip and I smiled victoriously, quickly slipping the ring through the newly made hole. What I hadn't considered was my father's reaction. He arrived home an hour or so later. I was sitting quietly at the kitchen table doing my homework. My father slammed his hands down roughly on the table making my pen slip across the page. "What the hell is that!?" My father demanded, gripping my hair and yanking my face back. "What?" I whispered, forgetting about my freshly pierced lip. "Don't act dumb with me, Edward!" He yelled, grabbing the metal and pulling on it roughly, "This!" I flinched; afraid he was going to rip it out. "I'm sorry! I didn't think you'd care!" His eyes narrowed, "I don't want you walking around looking like a fucking punk and tainting my name!" I stared up at him, waiting for him to just hit me and get it over with. He grabbed my hair, flinging me to the ground before stomping hard on my stomach. I grunted, gasping in the air that had been knocked out of me. "Whatever," he muttered, walking away, "It's not like everyone in this fucking town doesn't know how much of a prick you really are." We left not too long after. Bella and I exchanged phone numbers - which I was more than happy about - and Jasper promised to call me in the morning being that it was a Saturday. My father was silent the entire way home and it was making me uneasy. When we pulled into the parking lot, my father turned to me with unreadable expression, "So it seems we have much to talk about." I felt my eyes widen on their own accord before I exited the car and made my way to the door. We made our way inside and I stood in the middle of the kitchen staring nervously at him, waiting for what was to come. "That was close tonight. Too close. In fact I'm pretty sure that Carlisle figured something out in his head." My dad's voice was eerily calm as he spoke and I shuddered. "Do you have any idea of what I would do to you if any one were to ever find out?" I didn't respond, only stared at him in horror. "I would rip you limb from fucking limb, and I'd do it while you're still alive so you could watch as you became dismembered." I swallowed, my eyes squeezing shut as I tried not to imagine what he was telling me. Abruptly, a stinging sensation met my cheek and I fell to the ground. It took me a second to realize he had hit me. "Don't you dare ever cross me, Edward. I don't think you would enjoy the consequences."
