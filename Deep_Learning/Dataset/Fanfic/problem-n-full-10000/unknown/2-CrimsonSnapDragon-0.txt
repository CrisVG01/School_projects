weapons?" He questioned. "Why are you so nosy?" She retaliated. He laughed some more. "Are you always this hostile?" "Are you always so annoying?" She shot back, her eyes still focused on the table. He held out his hand. "My name is Imeron." He introduced. She glanced at his hand dryly. "Do you want a medal or something?" She asked, raising an eyebrow. "No. I just want your name." Imeron replied. "And I want a mansion. Doesn't mean I'm gonna get it." Imeron shook his head, chuckling. "A name hardly compares to a mansion." He laughed. "Are you saying my name is worthless?" She scowled. "How would I know? You haven't told me your name." He said, a lopsided grin forming in his handsome features. She ran her eyes over him. He had on a brown leather vest, and brown pants. His boots were faded and scuffed, but they were brown too. His skin was weathered and tanned. His eyes (the only thing he had that wasn't brown) were a sharp, piercing green. His brown hair was shaved, and a small beard ran around his chin. It was short and bristly, kept well. "Go away." Ondraya growled. "Only after you tell me your name." He smirked. "I don't accept blackmail." She growled. "I don't accept haughtiness." He smiled at his cleverness. "Then don't look in the mirror." She snapped, putting her mug down and standing up. She started walking out the doors. Imeron scrambled after her. He grabbed his sack on his way out the door. He got outside to see her mounting a white steed. "Leaving so soon?" He asked, grinning crazily. "The sooner to get away from you." She answered. He untied his horse from the standing pole, and jumped on it. "I shall follow you then." He declared. She smirked wickedly. "Good luck." Was all she said, before she gave her steed a good kick, and went flying down the trail. "HEY! NO FAIR! YOU GOT A HEAD START!" Imeron called after her, urging his stallion forward. The trees flew by them and they ran on and on. Miles stretched behind them. Finally, they reached the river. Ondraya's horse stopped short. "Whoa! Boy, whoa!" She hollered. He reared up in fright, causing her to clutch his mane to stay on. She gave him a slight kick. "GO!" She ordered. He whinnied and snorted, eyes wide. "GO!!" She repeated. He growled and stamped his hooves. Imeron came racing around the corner. "Ah! There you are! Waiting for me?" He smiled cheekily. She scowled at him. "First one across the river, wins!" He declared happily. Her eyes flared. "Hey! I never..." Too late. Imeron was half way through by now. He stopped and turned around. "What? Did you quit or something?" He demanded. She glared. "No." "Fine, but if I beat you, you have to tell me your name!" He laughed, leaning forward on the horse. The stallion trotted delicately across the last few steps, and reached the bank. "I win!" He smiled. "No you don't! I never agreed to that!" She argued, still trying to kick her horse across the river. He frowned. "What's the matter?" He yelled. "The damn beast is scared of the current." She called back, agitated. He dismounted his stallion, tied it to a tree, and started walking across the shallow river. When he got to her side again, he reached into his pocket, and pulled out a long line of cloth. He tied it around her horse's eyes, like a blindfold. "You're not very good with horses, are you?" He taunted. "Just shut-up and get him across the water." She snapped. Sighing, Imeron took the reins, and began to pull the horse to the other side. At first the horse resisted, but when it realized that the blindfold wasn't coming off, it had no choice but to let Imeron lead it. "That's it, nice and easy." Imeron soothed. Finally, they reached the opposite bank. Imeron glanced down at his pants mournfully. "Great. Just great." He muttered. "Ondraya." She said suddenly. "Huh?" Imeron looked up, confused. "My name is Ondraya." She repeated. He grinned. "Nice to meet you, Ondraya." He smiled, extending a hand. Ondraya glanced at it speculatively before putting hers forth as well, and shaking it. "So what were you up to, roaming the country?" Imeron asked. "None of your damn business." She snapped. He sighed. "Ah, back to that again, are we? Am I going to have to beat you at another contest to get THAT info out of you, too?" He commented. She glared. "I was simply roaming." She said finally. He smirked. "Well ~I~ was on my way to Lothlorien." He boasted. She frowned. "What is Loth-loth...whatever?" She asked, eyebrows creasing. His eyes went wide, and he did a small sort of gasp. "Why, 'tis the Realm of the Lady of the Wood!" He exclaimed. Then the shock faded from his face. "Since you do not but roam, you are welcome to join me there." He replied, winking at her somewhat. She frowned at what his little wink implied, but then shrugged. "Alright. As you pointed out, I have not else to do." She stated. His face burst into a large grin. "That's the spirit!" He declared happily. ~*~*~*~*~*~ Okay, sorry that this was so long and boring. I know that it was VERY Mary Sue-ish in the beginning, and so I apologize. This means that if anyone reviews and tells me that it sucked because it was a Mary Sue, I'm going to tell them to fuck off because I DID warn u in the beginning. For the rest of u who actually understand that ~I~ KNOW that this was Mary Sue-ish, please leave a lovely little review ^^ Thanx---- and I promise that this will be much more "LOTR" focused in ch.2 ^^ none of the main characters played a big role in this, did they? O well, whatever ^^ ch.2, I swear ^^ ~* ElfPilot *~
