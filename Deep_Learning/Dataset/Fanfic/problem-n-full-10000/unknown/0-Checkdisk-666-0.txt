and she died. The survivor casted spells on him but they had no effect. "I'm invincible!" said Ned Flanders, "INVINCIBLE!" He shot Diabolo and he died. "Quick! Everybody zap him!" Everybody zapped him but to no avail. He shot Drago the rebel and he died. And then the people shot him again and he shot Vampire and he died. Then Harry was like "Fuck it" and summoned a tank and killed Ned Flanders. "So, we are just us three again." said Harry. "So, I am going to search in his equipment for dank loot" dialogued Hermine. "Oh look, a pocket black hole!" said Hermione, "I know that because I'm a nerd!" She shattered the black holes vessel and everyone fell and fell and fell. "So, I am a clone created by Harry Potter?" said Voldemaarts clone. "Yes" said Waldemar. "And I was created by him to be sacrficed to summon Cthluu?" "Yes" said Waldemort. Suddenly, Harry Potter and co. appeared, trying to look badass by walking. "Lol!" said Stephen Hawking with his text-to-speech program, "You really trying to look cool, huh? Too bad your looking like the gay emos you are. Where even are your goffik friends? They were killed by Ned fucking Flanders? If you couldn't protect your butt-buddies from some saturday morning cartoon character, how are you supposed to protect yourself from the most powerful wizard of all time times two, the smartest human of all time and Snape and Draco? You are, what, 11 years old? And your taste in clothing is shit. Generic black robes? What kind of lame cultists are you? You could at least tatoo your entire bodies or something like that. But nope. Your not even close to the most powerful foe I have defeated and i'm fucking paralyzed." Harrys jaw dropped and so did Rons and Hermiones. Snape took the situation to his advantage and zapped the bad guys wands away. "Any last words?" he said. But it was not yet won. Hermine quickly drew a vessel and said "You activated my trap card!" The vessel was one of Ned Flanders and it was a space portal. Everyone got sucked in space. The wizards survived via magic and Stephen Hawkings doesnt even have lungs so he didnt suffocate. The place was the galaxies core. It was a very beutiful galaxys core with many pretty stars and a black hole in the middle. While everyone was surprised, Harry shot Voldemaarts colne with Avadra Kedavra. He died and the ritual was finnished. A green tentacle came out of the portal. Cthulhu was trying to come out for the black hole was now connected to hell! "Muahaha!" said the bad guys. Voldemort shot in fury to Harry. "You bastard!" he said, "you killed my clone!" Everyone was duelling. Out of Stephen Hawkings wheelchair came a minigun that shot at the bad guys. It was a long duel and while it happened, Cthulhu was almosz completely outside the black hole. Harrys and Rons and Hermines wands were finally snapped away. "Its too late, we already winned." said Harry Potter. Finally, Cthulhu came out of the black hole in all of his entirety. "I SHALL DRAG YOUR UNIVERSE TO MY DREAD FATHER SATAN TO FURTHER HIS UNHOLY GLORY!" said he. Suddenly, Käpt'n Blaubär appeared while driving the Titanic 2, a literal space ship and he collided it into Cthulhu. "NO!" said Cthulhu, "SHIPS! MY ONLY WEAKNESS! IM GOING HOME" A wounded Cthulhu flew back into the black hole where he came from. "Now" said Stephen Hawking while pointing at the bad guys with his minigun, "Ready for die?" Suddenly, God himself! "THOU SHALL NOT SLAY THY VILLAINS, FOR 'TIS MY WILL! THY PROPHECY IN THE FORM THOU KNOW IS NAUGHT COMPLETE! EXPERIENCE MY WILL! THY FALSE DIVINITY OF DESTRUCTION, LORD BEERUS, SHALL FALL THROUGH THY HANDS OF A GIRL OF UNKNOWN, IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE, THY FOUL DEVIL SHALL TRY TO SLAY HER AND FAIL, HARRY SHALL SUMMON THY FOUL DEVILS SPAWN CTHULHU AND CTHULHU SHALL BE SLAIN BY HER HANDS. THOU SHALL NOT SLAY THE EVIL FOR IT SHALL BE HER TO BE MY CHAMPIGNON AND SLAY THE VILLAINOUS SCUM! THIS IS THE PROPHECY AND MY WILL! I AM GOD!" He stretched himself until he was larger than the multiverse and everybodys eyes burned like fire from seeing god even though they were wearing sunglasses. "Well, that was... surreal" said Stephen Hawking. He could still not grasp what just happened, but he knew one thing. Harry Potter and his satanic friends were put in Azkaban, Voldemaart and Snape and Drago could still not return for the Queen and her government were still searching for them. Stephen Hawking returned to the headquarter of the International Justice League of Super Acquaintances. He told them everything what happened. "So, this prophecy you are talking about" said the boss. Everybody murmured in disbelief. "I know what it means" said one member. "How? What is your source on your claim?" said another. "Well, I'm Jesus" said the member. "Whaat? You are Jesus?" said the everyone else. "Well, the fact that there's a halo floating over my head and that I'm holding seven actual stars in my hands should have made it obvious, but whatever" said Jesus. "Let me have the screen for a sec." He switched channels until it showed the Dragon Ball universe. "This is where the final battle shall take place. Do not interfere, or else daddy's gonna crucify me." "Uhm, that's a TV show." said the other guy. "Yes, it's a TV show in our universe, but in their universe it's actually real. The whole thing is a bit meta, you know?" said Jesus. Jesus ascended to the heavens. He then descended back to the headquarter and stared directly at the camera and said this: "This entire thing is sort of a prequel, you know?" "Who are you talking to" said Stephen Hawking. "I must go" said Jesus, "my planet needs me" and he ascended back to the heavens.
