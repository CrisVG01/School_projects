I wouldn't be able to break it. Her feet were free, but her mouth was gagged, and she was only in her bra and panties. I dropped to the floor quickly to undo the tape around her mouth. "You're okay." She slumped, sobbing, as I uncovered her mouth. "Shhh . . . shhh." I rushed to untie her hands. My own fumbled, not able to unravel it fast enough. "Fuck," Jasper was in the doorway. "McCarty's got him . . ." I was still trying to free her. "Go get something to cover her with!" I shouted. "Hale, too . . . bring Hale in here!" Jasper disappeared from the door. "He can't hurt you now." I stared into those deep—expressive—and now sad, yet beautiful eyes. "You're okay." My hands circled over her wrists, gently rubbing where the tape was. She surprised me by hugging me tightly—shaking like a leaf in my arms. "You're okay." I didn't know what else to say, covering her with my body, and trying to keep her warm. "Bella, you're all right." I rubbed her hair. Of course, she was still a sobbing mess. "Sweetheart?" Hale bent down, wrapping a blanket over her shoulders. "Are you hurt?" she asked. Bella was still holding onto me, but shook her head no. "Did he assault you?" She turned to her radio. "Central, I need that bus at this location on a rush." "No," she cried. "He didn't get the chance to." Her voice kept breaking. "It was time, but, but—" She fisted my shirt with both hands, burying her head into my chest. "He touched me while he undressed me. That's it. That's it . . ." I held the blanket on top of her. "What's your last name, Bella?" She sniffled, swallowing and looking up to me. "How do you know my first?" "Alice," I said. "She's so worried about you." I was too, at this point. "Al-Alice . . ." That started a fresh round of tears. "I want Alice." "We'll get her," I said. "We should let crime scene get in here . . . get her to a hospital so they can do a kit," Rosalie instructed. I nodded, agreeing with her. "He didn't—he only kissed me. He didn't get the chance to, um, do that." "How long have you been here?" I asked. "Since—since I left the subway at about 4:45. He brought me in here and left me. I don't—I don't know." I barely understood her, she was crying hard. "You saved me. You saved me." She held me even tighter. I hugged her back. "You'll be fine. This is traumatic, but you're just shaken up." "Really, Cullen? She was just kidnapped and—" Rosalie placed her hand on her hip, staring at me. "Come on, hon." She took Bella away from me, ushering her toward the detectives. I couldn't keep my eyes off the beautiful brunette as she walked away from me. She gazed back, too, but then I saw Jasper and Emmett hauling James away. I was quick to walk with them, leaving the apartment. In the stairwell, my buddies held him still, while I got a few more hits in on him. He was bloodied and beaten by the time he made it to the squad car. After all, he was resisting arrest. It was procedure like always after we left. Bella would talk to the detectives, get checked out by EMS, and whether or not she had to go to the hospital, she'd probably be home within an hour or two. That was comforting, although nothing truly went by procedure. Unfortunately, James tripped over something on his way in, and Jasper dropped him. He fell on his face, and I spied a tooth on the sidewalk after we picked him back up. This guy was so accident-prone—kept falling. Once he was in the cage, asking for medical attention, I sat down to fill out my DD-5 forms. My mind was shit, though, and Jasper took care of them while I had a cup of coffee. "She was lucky," Rosalie said. "Very fucking lucky." She shook her head. "If you guys hadn't shown up . . . Geez. I don't even want to imagine. That was a hundred in one shot—getting there before he did anything, or killed her. That's one lucky girl." I nodded. "That was still horrible . . . even if he didn't get to—" Offenders like James should just be shot on the spot—no one would miss them. "How did you guys know?" Emmett asked. Jasper grinned. "We're problem solvers. We look for clues, and we never dismiss a damn thing." He gave me a high-five, only I was frowning because we were ready to blow Alice off. Well, I was ready to blow her off, and Rosalie was correct. If we didn't get there when we did, who knows what that sick fuck would have done to her. "It's not all about arrests and the juiciest case," he told Emmett, "some people just need help . . ." He looked to me. "We work this beat every day. How come we never saw them before?" I shrugged. "They're not troublemakers." He nodded. "That Alice chick—you think she was twenty, like . . . the Swan girl?" He stared down to the papers in his hand, looking like someone shot his dog. I winced. "They both were—they're young." "Who?" Emmett again. "Stay away from those girls," Rosalie warned. "They're babies. That one we just rescued . . . she doesn't need another pervert looking to get into her pants." She gave me a wet Willy. I smacked her hand away, knowing she was correct and agreeing. But I knew I'd be seeing Bella again in court. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it! I'm not 100% sure what I'll be doing with this: a ficlet? A full-length fic? or maybe a two-shot? You guys tell me. How was this? Worth elongating? Thanks again!
