seeped through my skin. I shivered and Percy sat next to me. "I'm sorry," I said. "Idiot," he muttered. I looked down as Percy's thumb gripped my chin and he raised it to meet my eyes. "Why are you here late at night?" "I-," "Why did you even want to come see me?" he asked. "You could've-," "I just..." I said. "Look. Percy, I realized-," "If you're going to talk about that matter, than go," Percy said. "I'm sorry," I said, and Percy looked away. "Don't bring it up-," "I'm sorry that I said those words," I said. "I really do. I'm sorry I hurt you. I liked you Percy...and I still do. I guess you were the first guy I ever liked, and I was afraid. And knowing that you were Mr. Popular at college, I though I was way out of your league. And when you came to me that day, I just...froze and just wanted to get over you. But I was foolish. And as days passed, you popped in my head. And I felt so bad..." "Then why didn't you apologize earlier?" Percy asked, gritting his teeth. Wait...was he expecting an apology earlier? Was I this dumb to try to act cool? "Percy-," "Annabeth, you should go back," he said. "I really don't feel comfortable talking about this-," "I know you don't," I said softly. "But...I just wanted to apologize. You don't need to forgive me. I just want you to know I am sorry." "Okay," he said. "Now it's getting late. You should be going." "Okay," I said. "And Percy?" I said. "Yeah?" he said softly. "Thanks about earlier. Really...thank you..." I said, and he nodded. "I was just helping you," he said. Then, I hugged him. "Really...thank you. Now, I better head out-," But he hugged me, which stopped time. My heart skipped a beat, and he just patted my back. "You should go now," he said, but he didn't let me go. He held me tight. "You're hugging me," I said. "I can't..." "Then let's stay like this position for a little bit," Percy said softly, and he pulled me closer. I hugged him tightly, and Percy pulled me closer. And closer. And closer. Till I accidentally fell on his lap. I blushed, and pulled away, though his arms were still around him. Percy smiled. I blushed, and looked down. He hugged me again, and I sat comfortably on his lap. Then... Everything happened quickly. He pulled away a little, and kissed me. I couldn't breathe. Not by suffocation. It was just the fact that Percy Jackson was kissing me. I could immediately feel his hands take off my cap and slowly take out the bobby pins out of my hair. He yanked one bobby pin. I cringed, but he still kissed me. Finally, all the bobby pins were gone and my hair fell free. Percy kissed me as I smiled. Then, we pulled away. "Um..." I said, blushing. He smiled. "I..." he said, beginning to blush. "You..." I whispered. "I..." he said. "Um..." I said. "I kissed you," he said, and looked away. Then he whispered, "How could I be this stupid?" I felt a little hurt. "I guess that kiss was-," "It's not that," he said. "It's just I was supposed to get over you. And now..." I sighed, and cupped his cheeks. He stared at me and I kissed him. Time stopped again, and all I felt was his soft lips on mine. I wrapped my arms around his neck as I felt a small smile creep over his lips. He wrapped his arms around my waist. We finally pulled away and Percy smiled. "Gosh...I shouldn't be doing this," he said, but smiled. "I guess I'll go now..." "Yeah..." I said, and ran out. I went inside the elevator, towards the girl's dormitory when Frank came out. He smiled as I entered in and Hazel stared at me dreamily. "I'm dating Frank," she said, and I squealed for her. "YAY!" I said, and she hugged me. "How's with you and Percy..." "Just..." "If it's private, you can tell me when it's time..." "Okay," I said, and plopped on my bed. I put the covers above my head, feeling my lips. I kissed Percy Jackson. I KISSED PERCY JACKSON! Oh my gosh...I kissed Percy Jackson... The next day, I wen through all my classes. I had a bunch of homework, and I knew I had to study thoroughly. I finally did, and then Percy saw me. Dang it, Dang it, Dang it. "Annabeth!" he said, rushing towards me. He locked his hands with mine, and led me towards the staircase. "Percy-," "Just...be quiet," he said, and we were running above the staircase, laughing. My legs soon hurt, but he kept dragging me up. And up. And up. Till there was a door and he opened it. A rush of air came brushed through my face, and I laughed. Percy made me go to the rooftops first, and I smiled. "I thought you hated me," I said, and he looked at me. "I do," he said, and my smile faded. "But..." "What?" I said, a little hope rising from me. "I like you. And I..." "Keep on going," I said. "Forgive you." I smiled and kissed Percy's cheeks. "I'm really sorry. I really was a bad person. I-," "I was wondering," Percy said, and looked away. "Yeah?" I said. "I was wondering if you wanted to go on a date to the caf√©...and maybe we can sort out our relationship from there..." I smiled. "I'd love that." I said softly, and Percy kissed me. Butterflies flew inside my stomach as Percy wrapped his arms around me and finally we pulled away. "I really like you," I said, and Percy smiled. "Me too." "Well," I said, straightening my shirt. "Meet you tonight..." "Okay. At five..." "At five." Please review! And check out my story It's Her, Why Her? ! And yeah, please review!
