all stood up at the exact same time and walked to the bathroom so I could have the two of them touch up my make-up quickly. I smiled at them and we walked back out after Alice had fixed my eye shadow so my eyes stood out. She used brown and pink colors to create a unique smoky eye look. I walked back out and saw Edward standing at the jukebox. I looked to Emmett and Jazz and they both shrugged with a confused look on their faces. He hit a few buttons and Live Like You Were Dying by Tim McGraw came on. He offered me his hand and I took it. I smiled at him and started to sing along softly. He complimented me on my singing and I blushed slightly. Such an annoying trait, I swear. We danced around the diner when I remembered doing the same thing with Jacob. We had done the same thing and one day I went to his house to surprise him and I saw him making out with Leah, a girl who had been a friend to me for forever on the Reservation. I didn't cry, I knew we needed to break up and when he tried to apologise I put my hand up and told him we were over and if Leah was who he wanted, he could have her. Our dad's had been friends but after Charlie heard what had happened he closed off all ties. I know he misses him sometimes but he told me not to worry about it. I'm more important. I felt my eyes water as I thought about it and I ran outside forgetting Edward had driven me here. I sat on the curb and felt the tears start to fall down as I thought about all of the crappy relationships I've been in over the years. First Jacob then Mike. Jacob cheated and Mike well he's Mike. Not only did he cheat on me with three different people but he forced me into things no girl should do unless she means it as a way to express her love. I felt so dirty afterwards and I couldn't tell anyone so I sat and let it happen and one day Emmett had noticed how quiet I had gotten and asked me to talk to him. **Flashback** I sat on the couch with my friends as they watched TV. Honestly I couldn't tell you for the life of me what it is that they're watching. My eyes stared blankly at the screen and I thought back to Mike and I's last 'date.' He brought me back to his house and forced himself on me for about two hours straight. I felt so dirty and after he was done and spent, he fell asleep. Usually he did anyway. I walked around his room and started getting my things together when I felt his arms around my waist. He had snuck out of the room and found a bottle of rum. He took a large swig and after a few more swigs, he started to tell me all of the dirty things he was going to do to me. He had taken a tie out of his closet and tied me up. I screamed out and his parents listened outside of the room. I had been begging him to stop and to stop drinking and his mom came into the room when he went to pull down his pants and start my second round of torture for the day. When his mom ran in, she untied me and told me to get out. Not in the 'get away from my son you jerk' way but in a caring manner as if she actually cared. I smiled thankfully at her and when I ran outside of the house Emmett was there when I got home. He decided we needed to talk and I had spilled everything to him. He told the other's and soon they were doting on me and making sure I was alright. It was nice to have the attention but at the same time it was something that gets annoying after awhile. I had a restraining order against him outside of school and he thankfully no longer bothered me. I still have that irrational fear of guys screwing me over one day. **End Flashback** I have that deep rooted fear of a guy screwing me over like Mike and Jacob did so I'm not so sure about Edward. He's nice and sweet but what if some other prettier girl comes and sweeps him off his feet? He's going to drop me like a bad habit. What if this is all just his game? Get the most pathetic person you can find and make them fall in love with you and then break their hearts? Wait, love? I don't think I love him but I definitely like him. I just don't want to get hurt. Emmett walked outside then and asked me to confide in him. Like the last time, I spilled my guts to him and he gave me his honest opinion. I told him about my fears and he told me that Edward was beating himself up because he thought he did something wrong. I felt my eyes water again and I briefly wondered if I would ever run out of tears. I smiled at Em and thanked him for all of his advice, as always, and walked back inside the diner to see if I could make things right. X So? What do you think? I think I'm going to try to update every Saturday for some of my stories and I'm taking down A Day to Change Everything soon. Let me know what you think and is it alright that I put in those song lyrics as long as I disclaim? Or should I just put the song title and say what they are doing? You guys are awesome so please review!
