the best shots, she went over and provided cover and then we all moved across." Emmett says. "Alice here is really bad at climbing trees though so she slipped and gave our way our position and Rose provided cover for us, there were a dozen guys trying to kill us and a rapist gunning for our girls, we did what was needed." Emmett says firmly. There's been a few idiotic critics saying what we did was extreme, and that we're perpetuating a cycle of violence, obviously they have no idea what it was like. We walk over to the Hale house and start in Rose's room. "Jasper leads us, ducking around corners, using hand gestures to command our movements without giving us away, he's amazing, we go through his room where he has a rope ladder for when he sneaks out, and we climb down quickly while under fire." Rose says. Carol shakes her head when she looks out the window at the flimsy ladder. "Are you guys sure you're only seventeen?" Alice smirks. "Actually I'm eighteen so are Rose and Jasper." We head outside again. "From here we had to make a run for the Brandon pool house. We were out in the open and they're onto us at this point. Rose gets hit in the side, the vests protects her but she breaks a rib or two, and Bella takes a bullet to the thigh." Alice says. "Emmett just picked up Rose and she's over his shoulder shooting behind us, and Edward is carrying Bella as she provides cover, and then we come in here to catch our breath and evaluate their numbers and our damages." We step into the pool house. "From here it's the final stretch toward escape," Jasper says leading us toward the Masen house. "Edward gets clipped and Bella gets up and just runs with a bullet in her leg. Alice gets shot in her shoulder but we keep going." At the hole Jasper slides through to show our escape. "Jasper, Rose and I got through here." Alice says. "Victoria snuck up on Edward, Emmett and I then." I say. "She had us toss away our guns and then James walked showed up." Tears rush to my eyes. "He stabbed my brother when he didn't listen and threatened to kill him if I didn't listen either." Edward puts his arms around me. "He made her strip off her shirt and he kept taunting her, threatening her. But our Bella she was clever. She pretended to stumble and grabbed the gun she tossed and got Victoria, and then Emmett and I rushed James." We opt to leave out the bit about them trying to kill him. "Then we came out here and the police showed up." We return to the house where Carol wraps everything up. "How did you know what to do? You were outnumbered by fully grown men." "Chief Swan. You've seen his backyard and house. He taught is how to properly use a gun, and how to aim while running, we wouldn't be alive today if not for him" Edward says. "I can see you're incredibly close. Has this experience brought you closer?" We all look at each other, eyes searching, conveying exactly what we're feeling. "You always tell a person you love that you'd risk your life and die for them, but it's so much different when you watch as they do it, and then look them in the eyes afterward and know they'd do it again. We'd all face that horror all over again if it meant saving each other." Jasper says speaking exactly what we felt in our hearts. Carol thanks us and leaves and we make our way back to the house in the woods. The parents congratulating us on our bravery the whole way. "You guys did incredible, and really, thank you for doing this for her." Lillian says hugging us each tenderly. Anything for one of our own. Keeping with the idea of separating herself until she can process the trauma, Rose checks in on Twitter reading us the highlights. Icantstop67 Gonna go take my first self-defense class today. #culdesac6 #ChiefSwan LouiseSays They're legit Charlie's Angels.

POTUS?" Alice shrieks, Rose laughs and shrugs. "I just did it as a joke, raise awareness kind of thing you know? But look at this!" We all run downstairs where Dale and Lillian are watching TV. Rose shows them her phone while vibrating with excitement like Alice does. "Oh my God this is so awesome can you imagine? Real fucking change." Dale kisses her forehead. "You ought to join the political circuit kid. You'd run a hell of a campaign." Rose's face gets thoughtful, contemplating the proposal. I can see Rose distancing herself from the trauma and taking all of that grief, anger, anxiety, and just turning it into this big change for the better. Also we're probably about May right now, so it's been a few weeks since everything happened. Coming up: James' arraignment. Now Taking Numbers
