the time I found out about Luke dating Thalia behind my back: I'd gotten off of work early. On the way home I thought about taking Luke to dinner, something romantic. I was still giddy about the giant ring on my finger, I was head over heels for him. I continued being in a great, perky mood. I said hello to Peter, the desk security guy, and hummed all the way up to our floor. I wasn't living with Luke at the time, even though I spent most of the week there. I unlocked the door, and my heart shattered. Too wrapped up in each other, Luke and Thalia were heavily making out. I dropped my purse and keys, making a loud enough noise that they looked up. I'd never seen Luke to pale, his eyes seemed to bulge from their sockets. Thalia covered her face. I had stormed right past both of them and went into my room. I cried most of the night, sleeping very few hours. I heard Thalia shuffle around, she even knocked on my door a few times. The next morning, Thalia always slept late, I went outside to run, and I met you, "Wow. Did Luke ever try to talk to you?" Small Bob hopped on the couch, he had gotten bigger. I shook my head, "Now you tell me something." Percy thought hard, "I have dyslexia and ADHD," "No way! Me too" I sat up and slapped his shoulder He rubbed his shoulder, "Ouch," {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Our next date was out in public. We decided on having dinner in a sushi place not far from the apartment. I won't forget getting kicked out of the sushi restaurant because we kept laughing too loud. "Did," Percy wheezed, "see that guy's face?" I bumped his shoulder, "Or how that vein popped out of the bald guy's head?!" I turned to see Percy staring at me "You're beautiful," He said seriously, I blushed and looked at my feet, "No, I'm not" "Don't say that," Percy grabbed my bicep and we stopped walking. He then pulled me into an alley way nearby, "You are gorgeous, so gorgeous I could stare at you forever. Trust me when I say this, you are breathtakingly beautiful. And, I swear on my Mom, thats-" "A pretty big deal, I know" I muttered, I leaned against the alley wall. I couldn't fight the blush that creeped onto my cheeks. Percy's hands caressed my neck, before he brought our lips together. My veins felt like fire raced through them, Percy pushed me against the wall. Passion and lust invaded my mind, all I could think about was Percy. I brought my hands to his hair and tangled them in. I could've kept kissing him for hours. But, then I remember we were in some dingy alley, and I was getting my dress dirty. "Percy" I whispered into his lips, "Percy" I whispered more urgently, Percy pulled back sheepishly He rubbed the back of his neck, "Sorry," "No, it's just we're in an alley and in public..." Percy understood, Percy grabbed my hand, "Let's continue this back home," {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} "Oh my god, you did not just say that!" I covered my ears. Percy's thought of having kids with me, we've only been going out for 2 weeks! He's already thought of names, genders, everything! "What?! Do you not think of having kids?!" He yelled I looked at him, "No! I've been living with the future writing its self! I don't think this will work if you've already got everything planned!" "Well you know what?!" "What?!" "I LOVE YOU!" "I LOVE YOU TOO" "THATS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SAID THAT" "I"M GOING TO KISS YOU" "YOU BETTER" {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} I padded across the hallway, shaking. My nightmare still haunting me even after I woke up. I knock on Percy's door. And then again. When I lifted my fist for the third knock when Percy answered the door. I wrapped my arms around his waist, "Woah, Annabeth. Are you okay?" Percy plucked me from him. He bent his head down to look me in the eye. "Bad dream..." I choke out. I wasn't in the mood talk, I just wanted Percy. Percy thought, then grabbed my wrist and dragged me through the apartment. He led me to the window. He dropped my wrist and walked into the kitchen. I heard shuffling and drawers opening and closing. Percy came back with a red sharpie. He knelt down and drew a heart by my star on the small glimpse of Central Park. "Percy, what does this have to do with anything?" I asked, tired. Percy stepped back, "This way we'll always remember where we met. Or also known as the best day of my life" My heart swelled, he said we'll. Like he knew we'll be together. I laced our fingers together. And kissed him long and hard. "It'll be there for our kids," {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} 5 years later "Athena! Stop running in the house!" Percy chased a little blonde girl throughout the apartment, he found her memorized at the large window, her little fingers caressing a smudged black star and red heart. "Daddy, what's this?" She looked at her dad with big sea green eyes, her look close to a baby seal's. Percy smiled at her, "Hey, Wise Girl! She finally noticed it!" Annabeth rounded the corner, a small baby curled in a blanket, "Shh, Tyson is sleeping" she then smiled when she noticed the heart and star. Percy went over to her and intertwined their hands, wedding rings gleaming. "Well," Percy started, "Those mark Central Park" "And?" The little girl pushed on "A magical thing happened there. It all starts with a beautiful girl who wasn't looking where she was going..." AN: So this story took me about a month to write. I feel really good about the beginning but slowly it gets worse towards the ending. I hope you enjoy it! R&R I LOVE YOU GUYS ~Joy ^.^
