bowed to his father. He was about to turn away, when Thranduil grabbed hold of his shoulder, in the customary greeting or farewell. "May Elbereth help us." It was more horrible than Legolas could have ever dreamed in his worse nightmare. The smoke required him and his group of forty to wrap cloths soaked in water around their mouths more than a mile away from the actual fire. Even worse were the orcs that had come on them with no warning. They had no proper weapons they were used to, and the axes were not the typical weapons for elves. Few of them had anything bigger than short knives. So they fought grimly, against Fire and Foe, the smoke burning in their eyes, the flames creeping through the forest closer and closer. Legolas drove a pickaxe through a goblin's armor in the area of its heart; the orc did not get up again. Suddenly an arrow whirled through the smoky air, driving straight towards an elf with deadly accuracy. The elf fell with a pained look, an arrow in his heart. Legolas stared, aghast. The arrow was of elf-make. He followed the arrow's path back to the one who fired it. A man-no, an elf rode on a black horse through the smoke, reaching for another arrow from his quiver. The elf had long, blond hair braided back for battle, his almost-black eyes glinted a fiery light within. Morilion. He had come back for revenge against the Forest and Its Keepers. Eärion galloped through the hazy forest with a determined look on his face. He now knew that Morilion, the one who had healed him, had done so for his own purpose. To bring his curse down on Eärion again. Eärion had defeated it once, choosing total blindness, within and without, rather than to live with the abysmal visions of his father and mother's death. But Morilion had healed him of his blindness, and, instead of giving him a great gift, he gave him a great curse. Eärion had dreamed that night, and the images still floated through his head like specters. So Eärion would remove the curse, once and for all. He would kill Morilion. There had not been the slaying of an elf by another elf since the Elder Days, but he did not think of it that way. He only thought of it in one term. Revenge. Indeed, had Eärion known it, Revenge was the same thought that drove Morilion to his foul deeds. But those thoughts were far away, perhaps troubling someone who was not under the spell of long-sowed hate and bitterness. Eärion's quiver was strapped to his back; his bow, already strung, was in his left hand. He saw an elf in a crimson cloak. It was one of Morilion's soldiers. He strung and fired an arrow at the elf. He fell, dead. Eärion galloped past him, trampling his bloodied body. Legolas looked desperately around. Morilion's warriors were firing arrows through the murky smoke, killing elf after elf. What has happened? Legolas thought, ducking behind a tree to escape a shaft. Legolas nearly wept. He had been told of the Kinslaying, especially the horrific tale of the slaughtering of the Teleri, but it was so much more terrifying, horrifying and different to see it with your own eyes. And he would be next. Legolas heard hooves pounding the earth, and yet another figure came through the haziness, galloping through the forest towards Morilion and his men. The elf looked familiar, his blond hair streaming past him. He suddenly realized it was the elf he had talked to in the forest two days ago. Eärion. He had a strange, fell light in his eyes. The same light Legolas had seen in Morilion's. He watched as Eärion drew back an arrow and fired. Morilion fell from his saddle with a thud. Eärion stood over the gasping form of Morilion in triumph, glaring down at the slaughterer of his family. He had revenge, at last. "You have failed. Your revenge has failed, and I will live in happiness, even if my parents will not." Morilion's eyes opened for a second, a dead smile crossing his lips for a second. "The curse does not end with my death. You will now bear a double guilt, for the death of your parents, and also the guilt as I have, the slaying of Kin." Eärion glared down at him, his eyes flickering with the deadly Fire. "No! You will never win!" He screamed down at the elf. He took Morilion's own shining sword, and with one swift movement, drove it through his chest. Morilion gasped one last time, then was still. The images flashing through Eärion's mind sped faster, the unmerciful death of the soldier in the forest and Morilion's demise intermingled with his parents'. He looked with desperate eyes at Legolas, who had started to run towards him. He looked down at Morilion's glinting, now bloody sword in his hand. He dropped the sword with a dull thud; but as he did, an arrow from one of Morilion's guards pierced him from behind. Eärion fell beside Morilion, never to breathe again. Legolas walked the halls of his father, lost in thought. The fire had been quenched in the forest, though there was still a grim reminder but a few miles from the Gates. But the fire of revenge had not been quenched in the souls of two elves, and had consumed them in the end. Morilion had been a general in Thranduil's army. Until, Uär, Eärion's father had taken this position from him. It was a sad story, reflecting the dark side of the ages long past. Ever did Revenge cut off the hand by which it was made. Legolas sighed, tracing the grooves in the stone wall. Morilion and Eärion had never been found. So maybe it should be. But amid the great wreckage of the fire, one word was carved on a black stump. HERE. THE END
