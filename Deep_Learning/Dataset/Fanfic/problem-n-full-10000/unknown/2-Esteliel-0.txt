the woods and in the lands to the East." (p.161) Tolkien, JRR. The Hobbit . London: HarperCollins, 1999. #4 LACE and my take on it Can "Laws and Customs among the Eldar", Tolkien's (infamous among fanfiction writers) essay about Eldarin customs, even be taken as canon? Like all of the History of Middle-earth, I do not consider it canon, although I often look to his 'uncanonical' writings for inspiration. Yet there is a particular sentence in this essay that I like very much: "Even when in after days, as the histories reveal, many of the Eldar in Middle-earth becamecorrupted, and their hearts darkened by the shadow that lies upon Arda, seldom is any tale told of deeds of lust among them.(5) " (Tolkien, Morgoth's Ring, p. 210) I like to think of the story of Glorfindel and Legolas as exactly that: one of those seldom-told tales of a deed of lust. Christopher Tolkien also gives us a differing version of this passage from a former, completed manuscript: The Eldar wedded once for all. Many, as the histories reveal, could become estranged from good, for nothing can wholly escape from the evil shadow that lies upon Arda. Some fell into pride, and self-will, and could be guilty of deeds of malice, enmity, greed and jealousy. But among all these evils there is no record of any among the Elves that took another's spouse by force; for this was wholly against their nature, and one so forced would have rejected bodily life and passed to Mandos. Guile or trickery in this matter was scarcely possible (even if it could be thought that any Elf would purpose to use it); for the Eldar can read at once in the eyes and voice of another whether they be wed or unwed. (Tolkien, Morgoth's Ring, p. 228) Here, Tolkien did not even say that deeds of lust were rare; instead he apparently did play with the thought that some Eldar could be guilty of the pride and greed Glorfindel displays in this story. Interestingly enough, Tolkien does not even rule out rape here, only points out that no Eldar would take "another's spouse" by force. Also, for those interested in further reading on homoeroticism and subtext in The Lord of the Rings, I recommend the following two essays: Saxey, Esther. "Homoeroticism." Reading The Lord of the Rings: New Writings on Tolkien's Classic . Ed. Robert Eaglestone. London: Continuum, 2006. 124-137. Smol, Anna. "'Oh...Oh... Frodo !': Readings of Male Intimacy in The Lord of the Rings ." MFS Modern Fiction Studies 50.4 (2004): 949-979. #5 Sinda, Sindar, Sindarin; or Sindarin is not just a language Sinda refers to one single Grey Elf, Sindar means two or more Grey Elves, or even the entire people. Sindarin is the name of their language, yes - but moreso, Sindarin is an adjective which can be used to describe any sort of noun. For better illustration, take a look at corresponding English words: for instance Spaniard, Spaniards, Spanish. Spanish is an adjective that does, like Sindarin, refer to the language spoken in Spain - but it is also used as an adjective to describe things that come from Spain. You would say "a Spaniard", but you use the adjective to describe a noun; thus it is "the Spanish Prince" instead of "the Spaniard Prince". It is the same with the adjective "Sindarin" - it refers to a language, but also to any other noun you want to describe; so it is "the Sindarin Prince" instead of "the Sinda Prince". #6 In-depth explanation of Sindarin phrases, titles and names Ethuil'waew (spring-wind, spring-storm) is a compound of the following two Sindarin words: ethuil S. n.
