find my voice. I was in so much pain. Suddenly I saw the door open. "Sweetheart, are you ok?" Esme asked. I slowly shook my head. She walked over to my bed and sat on it and rubbed my head. The pain started to slowly go away. "There sweetheart, is that better?" She asked. I finally found my voice. "Yes, thank you." I said. "You're welcome." She said while she kissed my forehead and left the room. Chapter 7 -School A couple weeks passed and Jasper and I were on our way to school. "Are you sure you want to go to school?" Jasper said. "Yes, Jazzy." I said. "Ok." He said as he helped me out of the car and we walked to our first class together. "Welcome back, Alice." The teacher said. "Thanks, Mr. Baker." I said as Jasper helped me to my chair. I have crutches but Jasper still likes to help me. "So how was your week away from school, Mrs. Alice?" Mr. Baker asked. "Painful." I said. "I heard. It was on the news. Well, all that was on the news was just saying that our newest member of Forks Washington was in the hospital." He said. "Oh." I said as I slumped into my seat. "You ok, Ali?" Jasper asked softly. "Yah, I guess." I said I suddenly got hit with a vision. Vision "Hello, Mary." I heard someone say. "Who are you?" I asked. "Do you not remember me, Mary? I'm your father." He said as he came closer to me and I finally saw his face. "No, no, no stay away from me! Jasper, where are you? Carlisle, Esme, Edward, Someone? HELP!" I yelled. "You disobeyed my orders, Mary. Now you will face the consequences." He said as he walked closer and closer to me. "No, please stay away!" I screamed as a grabbed my arm and twisted it. I screamed in pain and then I was on the ground be kicked by his still toed boots. I started to drift off in the dark. End of vision I was breathing really hard. "Alice, Alice, Alice calm down." Jasper said as he pulled me into his arms and rocked me. "I wunna go home." I said while shacking. "Ok." He said. "I can't breathe..." I was cut off as darkness overwhelmed me. Jasper's p.o.v "You need to get her to you dad, she's turning pale." Mr. Baker said as he opened the door for me as I left the class room with Alice in my arms. When I put her in my car I literally drove so fast to my house. I was so worried about Alice; I knew it wasn't good for her to go to school. I pulled out my phone and dialed dad's number. "Jasper, what's going on?" He asked over the phone. "It's Alice. I think she had a vision in class and it was a bad one cuz she was breathing very hard and she passed out." I said. "I'll check her when you get home." He said. "I'm already home." I said while I rushed to the door and hanged up. I opened the door and went straight to dad's office. "Oh god, she's very pale." He said. "I know. Dad, I'm really worried about her." I said. He started to check her. "She's fine. She just need some rest. That vision was too much for her. When she wakes up we can see what the vision was about." He said I relaxed. "Ok." I said while I sat in a chair and just watched her. "You want to go hunt with me? I'll get Esme to keep a good eye on her." He said. "Ok." I said as I slowly kissed Alice's forehead and left. We went downstairs. "Hey, Ez?" Dad asked. "Yes, hun?" Mom asked. "Keep a good eye on Alice. We're going hunting." He said. "Ok, be careful." She said. "We will!" I called out. Esme's p.o.v I walked up to Carlisle's office and I saw Alice lying on the couch covered up with hey lime green fuzzy blanket. I fell in love with Alice since the first time I saw she. And I mean like motherly in love. Meeting Alice was like meeting a sweet little 10 year 0ld. I think of Alice as my own daughter. She so sweet and she even asked me and Carlisle if we could adopted her and if she can call us mom and dad. I said yes and that mad my day when she asked that. Alice and I were so close it's like she was meant to be my daughter. Being with Alice makes me feel like she's my real daughter. I suddenly saw Alice move a little. "Hi, Sweetheart." I said while knelling down by her. "Hi, mom." She said witch made me smile she is already starting to call me and Carlisle mom and dad. "How do you feel, baby?" I asked. "Good. Where's Jazzy and dad?" She asked. "They went hunting." I said. "Oh." She said. "You wunna comedown stairs and watch TV with me?" I asked. "Yeah." She said as I helped her up and we went down stairs and she curled up on the couch and I sat next to her. She was covered in her blanket still. "Are you cold?" I asked. "No, I'm cozy." She said while curling up closer to me. Chapter 8 -New life. Alice's p.o.v My father was sent to prison for the rest of his life and I was adopted by Esme and Carlisle. Jasper and I got married before I was adopted. I stopped having those bad visions. I have really good visions now. I had the best life with the Cullen's. I love my new mom and dad. My new dad actually treats me right; he never lays a hand on me. And my new mom so sweet, lovable, kinds, and the best mom anyone can ever ask for. The End
