the birth. My wolf took over. He phased a few days after he was born." "Wow so he will definitely shift when he is older?" "It's not guaranteed no. His photo is on the wall above the fireplace. Let me put him down and I will be back." Nodding Jacob went to the wall. There were several photo's some of the old pack one with us all in our human form and then them in the same place in wolf form. Jacob remembered that day. Emily was beside herself trying to get ten wolves to behave. She ended up commanding us to sit as though we were dogs. When that didn't work she threatened not to cook for a week for us. Suffice to say that the photo didn't take long to take and they all headed inside for food. The next few photo's were of Brady and Paul smiling at the camera. Brady had his fingers behind his mates head in a V sign. Jacob could see why the photo was there. Both of them looked so damn happy and in love. The next one was of them kissing Paul's hand resting on Brady's stomach. Jacob had to look carefully at the slight bump but it was definitely there. The next was DJ in his parents arms when they were all in human form. Both parents chest puffed out. DJ was asleep but looked content. Jacob wondered if he had just been fed. It was the next photo that Jacob wanted to see. The cub was a similar colouring of Paul although his eyes were different. He was sitting between his parents his head held high. Paul's paw gently touching him as though he was ready to protect him if any harm came to him. Brady was his normal beautiful wolf. Now that Jacob thought about it Brady, Embry and Seth were the smallest of the pack even Leah was bigger than them. However they were just as strong as their pack brothers and Seth was the second quickest only Leah being faster by a nose. The last photo was the pack that was now excluding him of course. Someone must have used a selfie stick because they were all piled on top of one another with Paul at the bottom. Each one of them were smiling. Jacob couldn't help but smile as well. Maybe he had Paul all wrong maybe the pack needed the discipline that he gave them. Whatever it was they all seemed happy and that is all he cared about. "Seth took that. Thankfully the damn stick broke the following day." Brady said as he curled his legs under him on the couch. "Sounds like Seth." Jacob chuckled. He went to sit down beside Brady but thought better of it. He knew what his pack brothers were like if they got too close to their imprints. "Paul won't mind promise." Brady said patting the couch beside him. Smiling Jacob joined him. "I'm sorry Paul was such an ass to you today." "Wait you swore." Jacob said pointing at Brady. "Yeah well Paul is snoring way too loud to hear me." Brady snorted. "He made it a rule once DJ was born. Doesn't want our kids to have potty mouths like him. I have to agree but doesn't mean we can't when he is sleeping." "So the name Daniel Jacob where did that come from?" "Daniel is Paul's grandfather's name and always wanted to pass it on. And Jacob well you were our alpha although not mine and Paul's but we hold a lot of respect for you and hope our son is strong like you one day." Brady said a blush on his cheeks. "I am truly honored." Jacob hugged Brady to him. "We've missed you. All of us not just Seth." Brady whispered. "I missed everyone too. I should've never have left." he sighed. "Yes you should have. You wouldn't have been happy not being with Nessie. I imagine she is beautiful?" Brady sighed. "Not as half as beautiful as you. You've changed Brady." "I grew up. It helps I'm so in love. Paul makes me feel complete." "Who knew Paul was gay?" "Oh I turned him gay." Brady pushed Jacob's chest. "Seriously?" "Um no he was always gay. The man whore got the rumors out there himself to keep people from finding out. I didn't even know he was gay until I turned of age. That was when he asked me out on our first date. Two days later I was on heat." "So you bonked like bunnies." Jacob chuckled. "Put it this way I couldn't walk for a few days even with my wolf healing." Brady giggled. "Are you really alright with Paul mating with the others?" Jacob asked after a few minutes of silence. "Jacob why would you ask me that. Wouldn't you do anything to see your pack brothers happy?" "Of course I would. But letting my mate sleep with someone else, I honestly couldn't tell you." Brady just smiled a glint in his eyes. "So what else do you want to know?" "Um the errr," Jacob pointed to Brady's chest. "Breast feeding? You can say it you know. I'm not ashamed of what I am." Brady lifted his shirt. Sure enough he was just like himself with pecks. The smell of milk lingered in the air. "Touch them." "I'm good," Jacob said. "Oh for goodness sake." Brady grabbed Jacob's head and pushed his face to his chest. Before he knew what he was doing Jacob licked Brady's nipple. Milk leaked onto his tongue. Not remembering what his mother's milk tasted like Jacob risked another lick. It didn't taste like the milk he drank out of the carton but it was delicious and very warm. He only pulled back when Brady moaned. "Sorry." "Don't it's kinda a turn on when someone does that. I should get to bed." Brady quickly stood up. "Goodnight Jacob." he raced up the stairs. TBC
