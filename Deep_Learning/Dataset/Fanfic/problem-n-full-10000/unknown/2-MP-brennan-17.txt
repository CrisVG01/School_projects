each pair of eyes in turn before finally resting his gaze on Gilraen. His voice was strained. "Your son is the youngest chieftain in the history of the Dúnedain. Protecting his identity from the Enemy . . . will be difficult. I do not yet know what action my father would take were we to raise the child in Imladris. But, if I were advising him, I would ask that the boy's identity be kept a secret even from Aragorn himself. Only you would accompany him to Imladris, and no other could visit for some time. The child is young enough that we can raise him under an assumed name, imparting his true heritage to him only when he comes of age. It will be as though Aragorn son of Arathorn never existed, and if, as we suspect, the Enemy already knows of his existence, he will conclude that the boy died of some childhood accident or illness—that the line has truly failed." For a moment, Elrohir's words hung on the air. Then came the sudden clamor, as everyone found their voice at the same instant. Arandur and Dirhael were on their feet, arguing fiercely with Elrohir as Elladan tried to calm all three. Even Gilraen's brother Thorondir, only twenty years old, had joined in the debate. Their voices grew louder. Elrohir stuck a finger in Dirhael's chest and Arandur balled his fists. Gilraen drew a protective arm around Aragorn, who was finally stirring, a sob building in his small chest. "Enough!" Ivorwen's voice cracked like a whip, silencing all five men. The matron's imperious gaze skimmed over each of the debaters before finally coming to rest on Gilraen. Her tone brooked no argument. "The decision belongs to the child's mother." Aragorn, still only half-conscious, rolled into a ball and buried his head in the front of Gilraen's dress. The woman carefully shifted him to her hip and stood. "It's been a long day. I need to put my son to bed." To their credit, the men promptly looked ashamed of their thoughtlessness. Dirhael spoke quickly. "Of course, Gilraen. You should take the master bedroom." Gilraen shook her head quickly. "That's alright, Papa. My old room will be fine By the look in Ivorwen's eyes, Gilraen knew she understood. "I'll get the bed linens." The two women left the sitting room together and climbed the steep stairs to the tiny loft that had once been Gilraen's room. Everything was as Gilraen remembered—the narrow bed with its faded quilt, the old, battered boudoir, the moth-eaten curtains. Though she hadn't been in this chamber since marrying Arathorn, it would always be home. Ivorwen briskly stripped the bed and laid down clean sheets. Gilraen carefully set Aragorn down on the mattress. The child stirred, and his grandmother soothed him with a gentle hand on his brow. As she arranged the blankets around him, the older woman spoke in a quiet, conversational tone. "No one's expecting you to make a decision tonight. The peredhil's proposal deserves careful consideration." Gilraen tugged a woolen blanket up to Aragorn's chin. "I cannot think of a life outside this village." "Perhaps you should." Gilraen straightened slowly and turned to face her mother. She swallowed. "What have you foreseen?" Ivorwen avoided her gaze. "It's best not to speak of it." "Mother!" Gilraen's voice caught, and she quickly lowered it to avoid waking Aragorn. "This is my child we're talking about! I must know." Her mother sighed. "You do know, Gilraen. You know that so little can be known from visions and dreams. It is not the nature of the gift for things to be clear and precise. Often in trying to predict we do more harm than good." "But to speak so, you must have some idea?" Ivorwen didn't respond. "The peredhil are right, aren't they? They said he'd be hunted?" The other woman nodded slowly. "But your father was right, too; we have faced such evil before." "Tell me what you saw." "Gilraen—" "Tell me!" The old woman closed her eyes, suddenly very weary. "There are two paths now before your son, and the choice lies with you. If he goes to Rivendell he will be protected—sheltered. The Elrondion weren't lying; they consider the children of Elros their family. He will want for nothing, but he will not know his past, and so his future will ever seem frightening and tenuous. When he finally learns of his heritage, the knowledge will be a burden, perhaps too great to bear." The woman ran a hand through her gray-streaked hair. It was coming loose from its orderly braids. "If he stays in Fornost Eden, he will ever be in danger. Like all our sons, his childhood will be short, his life difficult. He will know constant peril, and the Enemy may yet claim him. But he will be Dúnedain, raised in the traditions of our people, and perhaps that will be enough to ground him for the trials to come." Her eyes watched something far away. "Sometimes, the sight is more a curse than the gift we call it." Gilraen swallowed past the lump in her throat. "You knew." She said suddenly. "That's why Papa opposed the marriage. You both knew Arathorn would fall. But you talked Papa around . . ." There was a long silence. "Why?" Gilraen burst out suddenly. "Why did you let me marry him? How could you let your own child become a widow?" Ivorwen's hand reached out to cup her daughter's cheek. "It had to be somebody's child." She slowly let the hand fall. "It always does." Without another word, Ivorwen turned and hurried down the stairs. For a long moment, Gilraen stood where she was, forcing herself to inhale deeply and exhale slowly. Then she turned just as silently, lifted the covers, and slid into the bed. As the wind howled outside and muffled men's voices rose once more, she pulled her child to her and longed for the ignorance of sleep. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
