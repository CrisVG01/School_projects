him even now... and he would always be with him. The archer held a prince's duty to remain strong for his people, and the smile he wore some days would be a mask to hide the pain deep inside. But on other days, with good friends or family by his side, Legolas knew his smiles were real and would continue to be. Because the Elven Prince of Mirkwood would never stop fighting... would never let the darkness win. That was one promise he meant to keep to all he held dear in his heart.

Tolkien or from one of the following sources; David Salo's book "A Gateway to Sindarin" (ISBN #0874808006), the online dictionary "Parf Edhellen" , the downloaded dictionary "Dragonflame" , Ruth S. Noel's book "The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth" (ISBN #0395291305), the extended edition trilogy movie dialogues cataloged online by "The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship", and the LOTR complete recordings lyrics cataloged online by "A Magpie's Nest". - I didn't use much Elvish this time except for the translation of "I See Fire" from "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" . Please don't use my translation without asking first because it seriously took me a long time to do that. Author's Notes: - Morlan and Morfind are characters I've used in other works. Same as Legede, Glorenpaur, and Elhael. Please don't use them without asking permission to first. - " Smile" is from the Charlie Chaplin movie "Modern Times" and in all honesty, this story was written around that song and around my translation of "I See Fire" from "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" . Everything else just kind of came together between the two songs. It happened because I was on a Hobbit-high (I started this back in January) and because I had just finished watching "Chaplin" with Robert Downey Jr. and just loved it and I felt that the song really captured the idea I was going for. Muse Moments: "Hiatus was refreshing..." Nil said, stretching her arms over her head. Legolas smirked, "I was worried that you would go a whole year without sharing this story with the world." "Well I started it in January or so... and I finished it for the Teitho Contest in September... then I went on hiatus." she replied. "Why?" came a question from Paris as he flipped through a manga on the bed. Nil blinked, "Well because I didn't want to write for Teitho for a while and when I write actively I end up wanting to write for it. It annoys me that only Aragorn stories seem to win these days. They should have two categories." Legolas quirked an eyebrow at that, "I do not mind sharing time with Estel but... you have been writing me with my father more of late." "Yeah that's Lee Pace's fault for being awesome." Nil laughed, jumping off the bed. "AND NOW I want to write more feelings of Thranduil." "No." Nil sighed, "PLEASE FERNANDO!" The Elvenking glared at her, to which Nil quickly dashed out of the room. "I WILL WRITE THE FEELS ONE DAY, THRANDUIL!" she shouted as she ran. Thranduil sighed, "Legolas..." "Yes ada?" "I wish she was on hiatus again..." he replied, one eyebrow twitching in annoyance.
