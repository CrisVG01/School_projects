the soft glow that emanates from the bank of windows in the living room. I never leave the lights on. Ever. Not spotting any tracks outside in the freshly fallen snow, I'm on high alert. Whoever has been or is currently in here, has been here a while. The cedar deck creaks in its usual spot, and I press against the side of the cabin, stepping up to the front door. Muffled sounds of music drifts from inside as I place my hand on the door handle and try it. It's unlocked and I push it open slowly, muscles coiled, ready to kick some ass. The smell of freshly baked brownies drifts to me—all chocolate, and rich, and warm—as I step inside, quietly shut the door behind me. Intruders baking brownies and playing music? My eyes fall to a pair of expensive looking high-heeled boots beside the door. Maybe it's Jessica. Sometimes, she brings me cookies when she's here for a fuck. But how the hell did she even get up here? I toe out of my boots, thankful that the snowdrifts have removed Newton's earlier hurling scene, and scan the living room. I see nothing out of place, with the exception of an unfamiliar ski jacket draped over the back of one of my sofas. Furrowing my brow, I make my way to the enticing smell emanating from the kitchen. Holy fuck, these brownies smell good. I'm drawn to the pan of chocolate goodness that sits on the counter, and I pull a fork out of the cutlery drawer, sinking it into the pan and take a bite. What the hell? I spit the brownie – if that's what you want to call it—out into my hand, my tongue desperate for something to wash away the most horrific taste I've ever had in my mouth. These are the worst brownies in the history of baking. Throwing the chocolate remnants into the sink, I haul open the fridge door, reaching for a carton of milk, not bothering with a glass, I press open the cardboard and drink back a few large mouthfuls in quick succession until the rancid taste starts to disappear. Maybe it's Emmett and another one of his attempts at a joke. Not fucking funny. At all. Narrowing my eyes in the direction of my bedroom loft, I stalk up the stairs, the music getting louder with each step. Axl is welcoming me to the jungle. Once in my loft, my eyes fall to a soaked black t-shirt draped across the foot of my bed, and a pair of jeans that could never be Jessica's. I see an iPhone that isn't mine docked in my sound system on my dresser. My gaze lingers on a black lace bra, and I can't help myself. I'm drawn to it, much like the brownies. Let's hope it doesn't have the same effect. I know I probably shouldn't be picking up some unknown woman's lingerie, but hell, she's in my house, making gut-wrenching brownies in my stove, and using my iPod sound system. I think I'm entitled. My fingers trace the black lace bra as the music track changes. I hear a little squeal from the bathroom, and then it starts. I love myself I want you to love me I can't help the smirk that overtakes my face as I move to the open door of the bathroom. An open door means come on in, right? When I feel down I want you above me It's off key, top of your lungs shower singing at its best. And who has the Divinyls on their playlist? Leaning against the doorframe of the bathroom, I can't help but smirk, my eyes falling to the blurred form behind the glass shower door. I wish for once I had opted for a shower with no door. It would be nice to see who's currently getting wet in my shower. Oh yeah. Bring it home, sweetheart. And shower girl does. Belting it out at the top of her lungs as the steam fills the bathroom. I don't want anybody else When I think about you I touch myself I switch the music off as mystery girl continues for a few bars before she actually recognizes that the music has stopped. Dropping the bra to the bed, I take up my previous position at the doorframe, leaning against it. I cross my arms, hearing the shower switch off and then a very quiet, "Shit!" Silence. And then… "Um… Hello?" a timid voice echoes from behind the frosted shower door. My smirk widens, my eyes staying fixed on the blurred figure just beyond my reach. "Alice? Is that you?" "Afraid not," I answer. Silence greets me again for a moment before she speaks. "I'm warning you now, I have pepper spray," her voice threatens. I suppress my laugh. "In the shower? You have to watch out for that soap. It can get unruly." "Don't hurt me. Please." Her voice sounds frantic, and for the first time, I actually feel kind of bad about sneaking up on her. Kind of. "Hey, hey. Calm down there, howler." I hear her take in a sharp breath. " Howler? Did you just call me howler ?" I see a palm press against the glass and rub frantically to reveal a small clear oval on the steamed glass. Hmm… she's a feisty thing. Her blurred figure bends slightly, and I see just her eyes lower to appear in the cleared portion of glass. They're wild and dark as she stares back at me. I move toward the door slowly, holding my palm up to her. "Hey. I'm not going to hurt you, okay?" "Who are you?" she barks at me. I narrow my eyes at her. "Hmm… I think I'm the one who should be asking you that. You're in my shower." "Oh shit! Alice said you were gone until tomorrow." I hold her gaze, lifting a brow. "Yeah? Well…Surprise."
