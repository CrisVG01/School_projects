and school would probably notice that I am living on my on. Though Paul doesn't want me going over there as the Cullen's are all vampires and werewolves are the natural enemy of vampires, but Bella used to be my babysitter before she became a vampire and had her daughter, and miss all of the attention she would give me which I have been lacking lately and was also trying to spite Paul for ignoring me. I've actually been going over there a lot more lately when I'm not with Emma, when her mind reading husband or Renesmee aren't around as they only make me uncomfortable and feel unwelcome as all her husband does is stare at me which really creeps me out, so he can't hear any of my private thoughts. I didn't want him running his mouth off to Bella like he always does when he reads my mind even though I have asked him nicely to not read my mind and Bella will go to my brother and tell him everything and I don't really want my brother knowing what is going on which is why I don't like her mind reading husband too much. He may have been nothing but kind to me when I go over to his place but he refuses to keep out of my head and goes blabbing all my private thoughts to Bella, when it is just an invasion of my privacy, and though he claims he means well when he tells Bella my thoughts, he really makes me not want to trust him. I know that I will just feel like a burden to my brother as that is how I have always felt with him and I don't want to be a burden to anyone and if Paul comes and gets me now, I will just know it is because he feels responsible for me, not because he actually wants me around or he would have came for me already like he had promised. I have been thinking a lot about my mother lately, having never really been given the chance to know her and really want to go visit her even if Paul doesn't want me to have any kind of relationship with her though I have no idea why. I just know that he came back from a visit and forbade me from ever seeing our mother, but I don't want to listen to what my brother has to say, especially when he has spent the last few years ignoring my presence so why I should I even bother to listen to Paul wanting me to have nothing to do with our mother when I didn't even get a say in any of what Paul decided and it wasn't fair, I just wanted to know who my mother was and that is all that I have ever wanted. I have managed to track down my mother's address from my father's old mail that I found after he took off when I was snooping through some of the things he left behind and had written to her a few times though Mama never responded back and wonder if that is even still her address. I have no way of knowing if she changed it or not because maybe that is why she hasn't responded to me and wanted more than anything to just go visit Mama and need to find a way to get there on my own without my brother realizing what I am up to, especially since he is to visit sooner or later. I was planning on leaving to visit Mama soon in California as soon as I figured out how to get there as I just wanted the chance to know her and I just know that she would want to see me, but was also scared of leaving too because that would mean that I would be leaving Paul and everyone else who I love and cared about behind. I knew that if I was to leave, I was going on my own because I know that my brother wasn't going to be coming with me as he said he would never wanted to set foot in California or anywhere near Mama ever again and would only try to stop me from going and Emma had a family that actually loved her even though sometimes she may feel neglected by them, with having workaholic parents that are barely home and a werewolf for an older brother, but she still couldn't just drop everything to leave with me as they would notice if she was to take off. There also was a part of me that needed to leave La Push, because I was just so tired of always being seen as nothing but Paul's sister and being looked down at because my father was a dead beat drunk and was tired of the council giving me looks for just wanting to be a kid that has fun for once without having to hear about how I had a responsibility to the pack that mostly ignore me. I was tired of nobody seeing just me, Dakota Lahote as not even my own brother who claims to love me but is much too wrapped up in stuck up Rachel Black to care about me and maybe this is about sending a message to my brother that I am tired of being ignored for her. I know that there was also a part of me that was just wanting to leave to get his attention and wanting him to come get me from Mama because he doesn't want to spend any time with me anymore, having mostly cut me out of his life and though I love my brother more than anything, Paul is just hard to read so I don't really know how he feels about me and I don't like that I doubt his love for me, but lately, I just don't feel it.
