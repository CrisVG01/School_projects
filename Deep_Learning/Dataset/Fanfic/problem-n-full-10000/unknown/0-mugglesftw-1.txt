pranked McGonagall?" Fred and George both blinked, the solemnly stood. "That's it, we're officially adopting you. Oi, Percy, get over here!" "What?" Percy demanded, looking up from his homework. "We're offically adopting Harry. He's pulled a prank so brilliant he has to be family. Get over here and make it official." Percy rolled his eyes. "I officially adopt Harry as a part of the Weasley family as the oldest member of the Weasley family present." "So mote it be," the twins said seriously, then kicked Ron. "Um, yeah, Harry's adopted," Ron agreed as he stood. Then both twins pulled out a flask of pumpkin juice and dumped it all over Harry's head, soaking him and his robes. "There you go," Fred said happily. George nodded. "Proper Weasley baptism." "We dub thee...Harry Weasley!" "Er...thanks?" "No problem." Then the twins turned to Ron, wide grins on their faces. "So, Ron, you going to actually play as seeker?" Ron gulped, and looked at Harry. "We'll um, we'll work something out," Ron stammered. Harry grinned, wiping away the pumpkin juice from his forehead. "We could take turns! You be seeker one game, then I'll do it the next. I'll be no one even notices; since we have on those goggles no one will even know." Fred and George howled with laughter, and even Ron had to grin. For his part, Percy just rolled his eyes. Great. He had another pranking brother. He had held such high hope for Harryâ€¦. The next day, Ron got a present from his brother Charlie: a brand new Nimbus 2000. "Heard you made the team in my old position. Congrats, Ron! I had a little money set aside so I decided to spend it on my new favorite brother. I'll try to make it out to one of your games some time. Love, Charlie." "Wow," Harry said, stroking the broom gently. "This is amazing. Will you let me fly it sometime?" Ron nodded, dumbstruck, his hands cradling the broom reverently. Dear Ginny, Hello, it's Harry, the boy from the train station. Your brothers have decided to officially adopt me after I accidently pranked McGonagall and got Ron made seeker for the quidditch team. I figured I should write you since we're sort of siblings now. Hogwarts is pretty great, and I am really happy to have a real family now. Hope to hear from you soon, Your brother, Harry PS: I'm not sure what to tell your mum, but Fred and George said they have plans. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Dear mum and Ginny, Hello, I guess you heard I made seeker. My four brothers and I are very excited. The five of us are all looking forward to all the games. I should tell you that it's really thanks to Harry that I got made seeker, but we Weasley's have to stick together. I think Harry and I might trade places for some games, I think he's a better seeker than me. Fred and George have decided that this might just top all their pranks, and will help us. Even Percy admitted that it would be brilliant for Harry and I to trade places; they do it all the time, and who could really tell the difference between me and another Weasley except mum and dad? Love, Ron PS, make sure to knit a jumper with an "H" on it for Harry for Christmas mum, he says you forgot him last year. His should probably be green. /\\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\/ Dear mum, (and Ginnykins too) Hogwarts is going well. We've managed to get Ginny a toilet seat, but neither Hermes nor Harry's owl Hedwig would carry it. Sorry Ginnykins! The good news is that Harry and Ron are fitting right in with the rest of the Weasley's, so don't you worry. They've somehow managed to even get Snape to like them. Even Percy isn't sure how they managed that, but we're pretty sure it was some sort of brilliant prank we'll unravel later. Love, Gred and Feorge. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Dear Mother, My studies are going well. I currently have O's in all my classes. I've been trying to mind Fred and George as is my duty as prefect, but they still managed to blow up one of the toilets in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Thankfully, I don't think anyone but Myrtle minded, and as she's dead its not as if she can use it anyway. Ron and Harry are doing very well. I am making sure they are keeping up with their studies even though they're on the quidditch team. Their friend Hermione Granger is an admirable muggleborn girl who is assisting me with this and ensuring that they do not become too distracted. With Love, Percy. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ After reading the letters, Molly blinked and frowned. Who was this Harry? She didn't recall having any one named Harry in the family. Mentally, she started to tally all her various children, trying to recall if Harry was on the list. With a crash, the kitchen widow shattered and a swearing gnome landed with a splash in the sink. Sputtering, it dragged itself out and immediately began swearing. "Oi, I'll have your mum you ginger headed minx! I'll take your guts and tie them in a pretty ribbon about your neck you ugly little bi-" Molly blasted the gnome back out of the broken window. "GINERVA MOLLY WEASLEY YOU GET BACK HERE RIGHT THIS INSTANT!" Molly yelled, storming outside to harangue her overly energetic daughter. An interesting side effect of the distraction, however, was that Molly had become even more confused about which of her children was who than usual, and now had added "Harry" to the mental list of names to call her sons when one of them had done something. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Authors Note: I wrote this after people on reddit kept begging for a red headed Harry story where everyone confuses him for a Weasley. I suppose if people like it enough I might explore the concept further, but for now it's just a one-shot.
