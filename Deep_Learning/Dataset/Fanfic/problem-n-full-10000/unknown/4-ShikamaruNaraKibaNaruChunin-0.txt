"Embry can you wolf and make sure they don't come near here" I add looking at him He nods kisses me then wolfs Now his fur was different then before it had a hint of red with a tinge of gold plus sliver he left me o my thoughts Seth was wolfed and Emmett was beside him "You know the red fur with our clours suit you guys" Emmett adds Seth barked ((So you shine in sunlight what's big deal)) "Wait did I hear you?" Emmett said "Yes you can its a power of Dragal So anything Emmett" Embry said Jacob sighs - ("Where are you Thomas?") He thought as he went in his own home "I think Jacob asking about Thomas because I just heard his thought asking where he was but Jacob a wolf Alapha as well isn't he?" Seth said becoming human again "Yes but he gave it to Sam, its still there but it might take over at a later time because of Jacobs grandfather" Embry said "Well I have to call mom she will wonder where I am, Emmett I like you, same with Alice and Edward" Seth said "Thanks" Emmett adds "I call her I told her my adress she told Charile to drive her here, I told them go to Jacob house there should be a road just before his house and here thery are" I say Emmett looks at the car pulling up "This is nice" Sue said "I'll pick you up just call I need get back to work I didn't know you knew a Cullen Thomas" Chairle said " I just met him today I need somethings done and some one was strong Jacob was busy so I ran into Alice and she told me her brother was strong so he help me put the finshes touchs on my home along with my mail box and Sue wait til you come inside, Emmett go around my boundires make sure they don't come I need to expain to Sue what's going on" I say He nods "We have a lot to tell you, Harry was on counil they need to know what Sam is planing, he's trying to get rid of me he had Paul and Jared spy on us, he thinks Thomas is a danger because of his Dragal side" Embry said looking at Sue "So you need my help to make sure it backfires on Sam, by going to the councial and telling them what's going on, but they would want a witness so Embry would have to come same with you Thomas and was he a vampire" Sue said "Yes I trust his family, I got saved when I was younger, my Dragal side want to take over and it was stopped now years later its kicking in" I say "I trust you, but you know the wolf law No offence Emmett was it" Sue adds "None taking, your son is good, same with Thomas and Embry plus Jacob so its all good" Emmett adds looking at her before going off to do what Thomas said to do "Ok let's get over with" I said going inside while Sue, Seth, and Embry follow, Emmett does what was asked 2 hours later.
