persistent daughter, they will probably be the first Muggles to make our history books, your parents will want you safe and blood adoption is the best possible way for that" he told her, she nodded and took a deep breath as they heard the flurry of feet coming towards the Hospital wing. "I'll go get the potion while the Headmaster explains everything to Black and Lupin" Snape told her, she nodded as he swung his cloak and left through the office. She didn't want to forget her parents or leave any thoughts of them behind, they had taught her, raised her, loved her, but her mother had always said not to question what fate had in store for you as she knew what she was doing, though she would forever miss and mourn her parents, she could do as her mother said and follow the path that fate had set for her, she blinked when someone called her name. "Hermione, oh you poor child, I am so sorry that this has happened to you, and it's all my fault, I should have taken my potion that night and Peter would have been captured and you wouldn't be going through this" Remus said as he rushed to her bedside, he dropped frantically by the side of her bed, his head bowed, resting on the bed beside her, his hand tightly around hers, she shook her head as she ran her fingers through his greying hair "This would have happened with Peter there or not, it was me that was the target because they believed it would be a major blow to Harry, Peter took a back seat until my parents were killed, they laughed when they were fighting me, stating that Harry would have been able to cope during whatever this big thing that is happening at Hogwarts this year, so please Remus don't blame yourself" she implored him, he looked up, his eyes filled with tears, she wasn't surprised when they flashed with amber before returning to normal. "Moony, love I told you that Kitten here wouldn't blame you, it wouldn't even be in her thoughts, Hermione I am so sorry this happened and we will do whatever we need to, to make sure you are forever safe" Sirius told her as he walked towards her slowly, to show he wasn't aggressive, she swallowed and took a shuddering breath. "Fate has her reasons, my mum always said never to question to her, I'm going to mourn them, I am going to watch the men that killed them suffer in Azkaban for a long time, then make them and their side regret ever targeting me and my family" she told him, Sirius nodded and patted her bent knee. "And we will be with you every step of the way, we want you to know that we don't want to or won't ever replace your parents, but we would be privileged to be your guardians in Blood and Law" he told her, she nodded as one side of her mouth lifted in a reluctant smile, "I must warn you Miss Granger, with Remus being a Werewolf, you might get some traits, but you will not become a Werewolf, do you still want to press ahead" Dumbledore stated, Hermione looked from the Headmaster to Remus, "I'm sure Remus will help me through whatever traits I get, I trust him and Sirius to protect me and teach me as I go" she said softly, Dumbledore nodded with a smile and a twinkle in his eye, "Hermione will be able to go after the blood adoption" Madam Pomphrey told them as Snape came rushing back into the room. "Albus, we must get this over and done with now, Phineas Black has told me that the minister has arrived in your office, and we have all of ten minutes before he heads here" he said as he uncorked the potion vial. A new urgency started in the hospital wing, Hermione watched through half lidded eyes, Sirius and Remus placed three drops of blood into the vial, she wasn't interested in what was happening so she didn't listen to the incantation that was said while the headmaster swished his wand around it. "Hermione dear, one shot" Dumbledore said as he handed her the potion, nodding he took the vial and tilted her head back, drinking everything in one go, wincing as it burnt her throat, she handed the vial back as her heart began to beat so frantically that she could hear t herself, her chest was tightening that she was breathing faster to make up for it, her head was spinning so she lay back in order not to throw up. "It will pass in a moment, you are gaining the familial traits of both sides of your new families" Severus told her, she swallowed back the uncomfortable feeling that was crawling up her throat, closing her eyes tightly as the pressure built in her body until it just stopped. "You are now a Black, Hermione I want you to take this potion it will help you rest, we don't want the Minster t question you right now" Dumbledore said as he handed her a sleeping draught, she nodded taking the potion, she didn't want to deal with the Bumbling Minister, soon after taking the potion she fell asleep. "She looks like a Black but she has your eyes Rem" Sirius said, his mate smiled as he moved a piece of hair out of her eyes. It was true, she was so beautiful, wild silky Ebony curls, pale blemish free skin, her eyes had been a beautiful amber before they closed, and she was smaller than she had been, another of Remus' features, "And obviously my height, she is tiny" he said, Sirius chuckled, "I didn't want to say that" he told him as Remus pulled a blanket on top of their new daughter, they looked up as the Hospital wing doors opened with a bang,
