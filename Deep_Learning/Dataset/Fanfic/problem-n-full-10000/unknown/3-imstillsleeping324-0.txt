I said weakly before passing out. "ALEX!" I heard Cornelius yell as I hit the ground. When I came to I saw a boy sitting with messy black hair and sea green eyes like mine force feeding me some sort of pudding. I blinked and sat up. "Where am I?" I asked him. "And what are you feeding me?" The guy smiled. "Welcome to the infirmary of Camp Half-Blood." he said. "AKA: The Apollo Cabin. Oh and this is ambrosia." "Half-Blood?" I asked. "What he means is demigods." said a girl's voice. First I reacted to demigods. "Demigods are myths." I said instantly. "Oh yeah?" The girl said looking me in the eyes. Her eyes were stormy grey and she had blond hair. "And I suppose the hydra you fought yesterday was also a myth." "That wasn't a dream?" I asked looking at her in disbelief. She shook her head. "No. And neither is this." the boy said. "I'm Percy Jackson." I rose an eyebrow. "Didn't you go to Yancy Academy?" I asked. Percy looked at me surprised. "Yeah in sixth grade." he said. "How'd you know that?" "I go there." I said. "You got kicked out for calling a teacher an old sot, right?" Percy chuckled embarrassed. "I don't think my girlfriend needed to know that." he said. I looked at the girl. "What's your name?" I asked. "Annabeth Chase." she said. "And Seaweed Brain you called your teacher an old sot?!" I laughed as Percy turned red in the face. "Uh. . . Yeah?" he said. Annabeth face palmed herself. I looked around the room as the couple started bickered like a married couple. There were a couple of bunks and a whole lot of bows and arrows and medical supplies lying around the room. I however did not see my best friend. "Uh. . . Question." I said. The couple turned to me. "Where's Cornelius?" "Oh he's coming." Percy said. "We was just talking to Hedge about something." "Hedge?" I asked confused. Was my best friend going loony and talking to plants. "A local satyr." he said. "Oh. The half goat half human things." I said. "They are not things, Alex." Annabeth said. "They're people with goat legs." The there was a knock on the door. In came Cornelius. But there was something wrong with his legs. They were goat legs. "Cor?!" I yelped staring at his legs. "You didn't tell her you're a satyr did you?" Annabeth said as I started taking deep breaths to calm my self down. Cornelius rubbed the back of his neck embarrassed. "No?" he said. Percy face palmed. "You'll get used to it, Alex." he said. If you're starting to wonder how the know my name, let's just blame my goat of a friend. I smiled and chuckled. "Anyway, Cor, why don't you show Alex around camp?" Annabeth said. Cornelius nodded and walked me out. When I got outside I had to shield my eyes from the sun. "Woah." I said looking around. Cornelius smiled and took my arm. "C'mon." he said. There was a whole lot of things to look at. The rock wall had real lAva streaming down it. They had an arena and a dining pavilion. Thing was it had no roof. "What do you do when it's rains?" I asked. "It doesn't." Cornelius said. He took me to a large blue farm house. On the porch there was a man riding a horse. Well, he was actually part of the horse. "Is that a centaur?" I asked. The centaur turned and smiled kindly. "Yes. I am." he said. Cornelius went up to him. "Chiron this is Alex Jacobs." he said. My eyes widened in shock. "Wait. . . Chiron. As in. . .?" I trailed. "The centaur who trained Hercules? Yes that's me." he said. My jaw dropped open "But. . . Shouldn't you be dead?" I asked. Chiron chuckled. "Sure." he said. "But as long the world needs heroes, I live." Cornelius smiled. "Nice to be see you Chiron." he said. The centaur turned to my best friend. "Wonderful to see you as well." Chiron said. "Now you two should head up to dinner." As if on cue, a conch horn sounded. Cornelius took my arm and steered me towards the dining pavilion. I was told to sit with the Hermes cabin. "You must be the new kid." the guy sitting next to her said. "Jace Laurens." (A/N: I'm just realizing it sounds a lot like John Laurens. I'm gonna stop talking before he get emotional.) I shook his hand. "Alex Jacobs." I said. The kids across from both boys tapped my shoulder. "Hi, I'm Conner, and this is my brother Travis." he said. The pair looked identical. "I'm gonna guess you guys are twins." I said. Travis shook his head. "No, Conner is actually a year a younger than me." (Correct me if I'm wrong.) he said. "Oh really?" I asked. Conner nodded. I learned that night that we had to burn food for the gods. I was like, "Wouldn't that smell weird?" Wrong it actually smells great. As we finished our meals, Chiron pounded his hoof on the ground, getting everyone's attention. "As some of you know, we have a new camper." he said. "Her name is Alex Jacobs and I expect all of you to make her feel welcome." The others nodded. Then for some reason they all started staring at me. "What?" I asked. Then I realized they were staring at the spot above my head. I looked up to see a glowing trident floating above my head. "How is this possible?" Someone asked from another table. I turned to see a kid from the Apollo cabin gaping at me. "We do not know Apollo." Chiron said. "All we know is that Poseidon broke the pact twice." I looked around and found Percy staring at me in shock. Chiron cleared his throat. "All hail Alexandra Jacobs, daughter Posiedon God of the Sea."
