said, backing up to look him in the eye. "I suppose I wasn't looking. In a bit of a hurry…you didn't happen to see his toad on your way here, did you?" Draco stared at the girl in disbelief. "You really think I'd be looking for one?" "Well, you did know Neville was looking for one," she said, not meeting his eyes. "Neville?" he said blankly. "I don't know a Neville." "This is Neville," she said, pushing the toadless boy in front of her. "Oh," Draco said. "We weren't looking for a toad . Blaise Zabini said that everyone is saying Harry Potter is in a compartment down here." Though of course, it was a good excuse to go looking for her as well. "He's in that compartment," she said, pointing to the compartment she had just left. "He's not really that special, to be honest." "I suppose I just have to find out for myself," Draco said, looking past her. "If you'll excuse me." He and his goons pushed past her to go to the compartment with the boys. Hermione was quite obliging, he thought as he walked into the compartment, Crabbe and Goyle following behind him. She had pointed out the location of Potter, and he hadn't had to go searching up and down the train for the bothersome boy. "I'm going to go see the driver," Hermione informed Neville. "I'll see you at school!" With that, she abandoned the boy in the corridor outside Harry Potter's compartment. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . The castle certainly was imposing. Draco stared at it as if he were trying to commit every little detail to memory. Really, the fact that Potter had rejected him, and Hermione had chosen the boat with Potter in it, stung a little bit. He kept an eye on her as they walked up to the huge door, as they walked into the hall they were told to wait in by Professor McGonagall. ( A half-blood, his father had told him. Dumbledore's right hand woman .). As they stood at a stand-still, he made his way up to her. "Which house," he whispered in her ear. She flinched, and turned to him. "Must you creep up on me like that," she asked, sounding resigned. He smirked at her, raising his eyebrows as if to say, what do you think? "I don't know," she said. "About which house. All of them sound perfectly lovely, I don't know which I'd rather be in. Slytherin is right out, of course, what with me being muggle-born and all. They're all blood-purists, or most of them are. I honestly think Ravenclaw would be the best fit, but Gryffindor would be…" "Wait." Draco held a hand out, stopping her in the middle of her tirade. "Muggle-born? You're muggle-born? " He sounded horrified. She nodded. "Yes…?" Her voice twisted up at the end, making it sound like a question. Draco took a large step back in between Crabbe and Goyle, his nose wrinkled. Muggle-born . It wasn't possible. "And your last name?" he said coldly. "Granger," she said, responding to his cold tone with an even colder one of her own. "Of course," he sneered. "Muggle-born." He shook his head, still not believing it. " Muggle-born ." He pushed away from her. Crabbe and Goyle followed him, reserving a sneer for the defamed girl. She watched them go, suddenly understanding. Malfoy. His father was a blood-purist, or his grandfather had been. She shuddered. Of course he was. Hunching her shoulders, she turned to follow the group into the hall, attaching herself to Harry Potter once again. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Another generation. Draco was confused. Did the hat usually talk to those it sorted? I'm sorry? He thought at it. That's how I keep track, the hat replied . Yet another Malfoy, bound for Slytherin . Yes, put me there , Draco said firmly. Are you sure? The hat said . You…you could follow in your father's footsteps in Slytherin, that is for sure. But your little muggle-born friend is in Gryffindor. She's not my friend. Put me in Slytherin, please, put me in Slytherin , Draco begged desperately. If you're sure , the hat said. Better be SLYTHERIN! The last was shouted out to the hall. Draco sighed with relief, and moved toward his new house's table, disguising his shakiness as best he could. Hermione watched him. Slytherin. How did she not see it? And…why did it hurt so much that he had rejected her. She was beginning to lose her hopes for best friends. It was occurring to her that wizarding children were exactly the same as normal children, just with magic. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . "Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts…" Draco opted out of singing, and just watched as the whole school made fools of themselves. He laughed with Zabini at the teachers, standing up there smiling, or, in the case of Professor Snape, scowling furiously. All of them, except for Dumbledore, looked as if they wanted to plug their ears. "Crazy old duffer," Zabini said. Draco nodded. Almost against his will, his eyes were drawn to the muggle-born. Hermione Granger. He cringed and looked away. She was singing with fervor, as if they were going to be graded on it. When the feast was over, he almost decided to seek her out. At the last minute, he turned and followed the Slytherin prefect, putting the bushy-haired girl out of his mind. Now if only he could forget he had met her. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
