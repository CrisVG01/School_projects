like an inferior anyway. And I know it sounds trite because I've said it already today… but it means the world to me that you spoke for me. It's why I managed to drag myself here that first day. Because I was feeling like crap but was pretty sure you wouldn't kick me when I was down. So thank you. Very much, for everything. Have a good evening for me. Someone should," he said, leaving. He wasn't walking quickly. Hermione could have said something. But she didn't know what to say. She knew she would not have a good evening either. *****Evening***** Hermione hugged Crookshanks securely, so he couldn't escape until he decided to really scratch her, which he might at any moment. He wasn't much of a cuddler, except occasionally on his own terms. Normally she would be worried about herself, or her friends, pseudo-family, the major, life changing decisions she'd made that night... But mostly she was worried about a young werewolf who lived alone with a kneazle and an owl. Maybe she should have told him to go back to Malfoy Manor, to do whatever he'd done in months past. But he'd obviously decided it was time to leave that place for a reason, and Hermione approved. *****Day 1***** Hermione kept looking at her clock, waiting for it to be the right time. Not that Draco would necessarily come that day, because he didn't need his potion. But he never really needed the potion, or he could have picked up a week's worth at once like every other werewolf she met with. He had found reasons to come see her, and he never really hid it, at least not since he brought her Crookshanks. Draco came later that day, looking about like he had the day before. He sat without speaking. He always shut the door when he came in and left, regardless of whether it had been open or closed before. She never used to keep her door open at all. Maybe she had started watching for when he would be visible in the hallway. "I broke up with Ron," she blurted. "I told him I thought we were better as friends and I didn't want to ruin that. And I think it's true. We were never really very physical and we were apart for almost all the time we were together, and we don't even see each other that much now. And maybe we were just together because we always thought we should be. Because it was clear early on that Harry was the closest thing I had to a brother, and Ron was the logical choice. And maybe I wanted to be accepted as a real Weasley. I didn't tell him most of that, because I didn't want to hurt him worse, but those aren't good enough reasons to stay with someone." Draco closed his eyes for a moment and positively beamed out of his tired face. "That first day, what made you so confident that I'd be lucky enough to be with someone too good for me?" he asked. "That was rude of me, especially when you were upset and had a legitimate concern. I'm sorry," Hermione said. "I reveled in your annoyed confidence that I- a werewolf and former Death Eater- because that's what I am, even if I wasn't totally willing and was never high enough to take the dark mark- would be happily married to a woman I didn't deserve. It gave me confidence to chase after the best person I know. Because I always knew that since you were helping Neville Longbottom look for his toad. Even if you were rather abrasive about it. I thought you had to have been pureblood with that attitude, you know. That's why I asked your name. I was surprised when I didn't recognize it. I'm sorry I didn't appreciate you then. I could have snuck in and been your first real friend at Hogwarts, I think. Befriending you and Longbottom would have done me better than Crabbe and Goyle," he said. "No more apologies for a while, I think," Hermione said. "Oh, but I've gotten so good at them. I never had much practice before. And the last was more of a regret than an apology," he said thoughtfully. "No regrets," Hermione said. "It was all needed to make us who we are now. And now we just have to try our bests to make that worth it." She hoped that sounded wise. "Then instead of regretting not having you over last night… may I ask you to be with me next month?" he asked. "I will," Hermione said mouth dry. "And will you come with me to dinner now?" he asked. Hermione usually wouldn't leave for hours but… "I- can't be seen with someone else so soon. I still want to be friends with Ron eventually, and that would ruin any chance," Hermione said, biting her lip. And honestly that person being Draco Malfoy would make it much worse. "Then I'll leave first, and then you leave in five minutes. And in six minutes, I'll call you if I haven't seen you at my address- which I assume you still have. I've learned how to get muggle takeaway. It's great," Draco said just a bit smugly. "Okay," Hermione agreed, blushing. "You were always going to say yes, if only to meet Marigold," Draco teased. "You know me so well," Hermione said. Because maybe they always had been aware, watching each other. Hermione never liked the idea that a child would be mean to the person he liked but… maybe. And regardless, they weren't children anymore. A/N: This came to me and I wrote it all in one day, which is unusual for me. I don't think I have more to this story in me, but who knows, maybe one of you could give me the right directional motivation! Encouragement appreciated!
