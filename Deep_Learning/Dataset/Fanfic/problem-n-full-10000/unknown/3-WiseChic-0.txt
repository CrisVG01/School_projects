saying is you are seeing all these happy couples and maybe you just want to experience it all. Am I right?" She concludes. I just grumbled a bit, "Whatever." "You too." She replied. Confused, I asked, "What?" "The Last Song, 'Whatever means fuck you.' " She laughed. "Oh. Well, should I leave?" I asked. "Yes. I think you should." She says. "Thanks, Sarah." I smile and give her a hug before standing up, "That was extremely helpful." "You're welcome. Now, shoo!" She shoos me out the cabin. I shake my head and wander around camp. Then, I see a glint of silver in the distance. The Hunt. I decide against meeting them there and instead opt to go find Aiden. I head over to the Hecate Cabin where he should be. I ask Lou Ellen if she's seen him and she says no. When I find this kid he is so going to- ouch! "Hey! Watch where you're...Nico?" I asked. "Yeah." He sat rubbing his head. "We have got to stop meeting like this." I say. He laughs,"Yeah it's getting to be a bit painful." I laugh and then help him up. We start talking about how we've been the past few years. I start to notice things like the way his eyes shine when he talks about something he enjoys, how likes to gesture a lot to emphasize his point, how his brown, almost black eyes stand out against his pale skin. How he is overall a very good-looking- stop Thalia. "Well, I'd love to stay and catch up but I need to go tell Artemis something." "K. Later, Thalia." "Bye, Nico." I wave and race into the Artemis Cabin. As soon as I get there I immediately ask to talk with Artemis. Alone. Everyone leaves the Cabin in search of something to do. "My Lady I-" "Thalia, I already know why you are here." "You do?" I ask surprised. "Yes. You wish to leave the Hunt because you miss your friends and family and wish to experience a full life. I completely understand. So, if this is what you truly wish...I will relieve you of your duty as Lieutenant of the Hunt." "I-...It is what I wish, My Lady." "Then, as much sorrow as this brings me. Thalia Grace, daughter of Zeus, sister in arms, I relieve you of you duty to the Hunt and give you my blessing of a successful life. Who do you choose to succeed you as Lieutenant?" She asks of me. "I choose my former sister-in-arms, Phoebe to succeed me as Lieutenant of the Hunt, My Lady." I answer. "Good-bye, Thalia. I wish you well." "Thank you, My Lady." I remove my circlet and set in down in front of Artemis and walk out the door. "Thalia." Artemis says as I walk out. I stop and turn back,"Send in Phoebe for me." "Yes, My Lady." I find Phoebe chewing out the Stolls for stealing her bow and arrows. "Phoebe!" "Yes, Thalia!" She answers. "Lady Artemis wishes to see you." "For- Yes, I'll head over right away." She hurried off to the Cabin. I was trying to figure out who to tell first. Percy would be confused. Annabeth would freak out. Jason would gawk at me. Leo would flirt to no ends. Piper would ask why. Hazel...well I haven't really talked to her too much or Frank for that matter. Sarah already knows. Rachel would shrug and continue painting or tell me she foresaw it. Bree and Maddie wouldn't understand. Brad wouldn't really care. Chiron would congratulate me or something. Mr. D would complain about having to deal with me for another 47 years. Nico would just treat me like usual. I don't feel like messaging Reyna- Wait. Nico wouldn't treat me any different! I jumped up and headed over to the Hades Cabin where Nico was listening to Green Day. I turned the music down after I realized he was knocked out on his bed. I poked his face trying to wake him up. Then I got between him and the wall and shoved him off the bed. "What the-" He shouted. Thump . "Morning, sleepyhead." "Was that really necessary?!" He glowered. "Yes." I blinked a few times and pretended to look innocent. "You're an idiot. Hey wears your tiara thing.?" He asked. Here we go just say it. "It a circlet, first of all." "Whatever." "You too." "What?" "Nevermind. I have to tell you something." "Ook. What is it?" He scratched his head and then got up and sat next to me. I tried to pretend I didn't feel the heat coming of his body. It gave me shivers. "Promise you won't freak out?" "Sure." He got up and grabbed two mugs of black coffee and handed me one. "Thanks." I took a sip. "Soo..." He prodded. "Right. Well, um...I left the Hunt." He was drinking from his mug and he was so surprised he dropped his mug. He swallowed the coffee in his mouth, " What?!" He spluttered. SO THERE WE HAVE IT.
