shanty laughing as he strode after her lithe form. "Don't like much chasing chickens. Little girl all grown up, coming to avenge her mommy," Artemis hurried opening the door and locking it in place with a slam. She reached for the lever of the lock but she was hurried seeing that it was broken and won't fit at all. She nearly screamed as she saw the black eyes poring over her at the other side through the cracks. "There are two kinds of people little goddess. Those who have the guts to pull the trigger and those who do not," Artemis trembling all over leaned her back on the door pulling the hand crossbow pulling the lever. Her trembling did not help as Boagrius punched the door with a force that nearly sent her to the floor. As it was, she just dropped the bronze arrow. "You weren't asleep that night as I fucked you didn't you goddess? You had the best ass I had ever penetrated," muttered the man behind the door and Artemis whimpered as he laughed sending shivers of fear in her spine as she fruitlessly tried to reach for the arrow with her feet. If she moved, he would enter and she doesn't want to think what he would do to her if he entered. He expressed his wants clearly before already. "Your mommy's blood is delicious-" Artemis closed her eyes and made a split decision as she jumped towards the arrow and pulling it to its lever just in time as the door burst open revealing a smiling Boagrius. "-hope yours taste better," his laugh died and Artemis smirked as she clicked the lever aimed at his right eye. There was a squelching sound as the arrow hit him right where she wanted and he fell down on the planks immediately like a sack of potatoes unmoving and dead. Artemis blinked, breathing in and out as adrenaline coursed her body. She was nearly killed and she stumbled a bit as she walked over the dead body taking comfort that it was really dead judging by the arrow bolt driven in its eye towards its brain. walking back towards the warehouse where there was a bit more light. Artemis took a deep breath as her ponytail dropped to her side then she laughed out loud. She did it, she killed the person who murdered her mother and raped her. Still laughing, she pulled the crossbow and threw it to the waters, watching it sink. This is so unreal, after many years, she had finally done it. Still laughing and smiling she looked to where Boagrius, body was and her laughter vanished noticing that there is no body. She is a second away to check for golden dust to see if it was a monster she killed when someone tapped her at the back. Artemis screamed as a man who was obviously Boagrius but with sharp large teeth and bleeding eye where the arrow still protruded roared in front of her. His nails have elongated to claws and his mouth is twice its size as it attempted to bite her. Artemis barely moved her head to the side to avoid being bitten but Boagrius sudden appearance startled her that she fell to the planked floor. Saliva dripping from his mouth, Artemis was stunned and horrified as the man or monster seized her right breast and Artemis screamed in pain as she was pulled by her chest and made a three sixty in the air as the grip left her breast and went to her neck. Next thing Artemis knew, her head was smashed hard to the planks and she coughed feeling her golden blood spill from a head wound by the move. Dizzy, Artemis barely felt being pulled in a prone position as she was forced to look up at the monster who was still growling and she weakly tried to fend off its attempts on ripping the front part of her clothes with her arms as she coughed up ichor. She felt cold wind touch her skin and she shivered as the monster lunged at her now exposed smooth neck for a bite tugging at her revealed chest with a force that is obviously inhuman. But Artemis noticed that the two of them are not alone. There behind the monster was the scar-faced green eyed stranger she had seen at the pub who touched her leg. She watched as if in slow motion as the stranger grabbed Boagrius' curly hair and twisting him like he did at Artemis five seconds before, she watched in fascination as the stranger smashed him to the planks with such force that the entire dock shivered. Then for finals, he simply threw the monster through the warehouse side skidding through wood, stone and steel as it roared in pain towards the moon. The last thing that the moon goddess saw before she fainted again was the face of the green-eyed stranger looking at her and covering her naked top with his jacket. ... ... ...
