as best as I could to avoid the electricity. I couldn't. It was everywhere. I tried to get to my feet, but couldn't stand. I turned around. Something was moving. I looked. Nothing, unless… I looked up to see the vent being taken out of place. "Who, who is it.." I murmured. Something then fell through the vent. Something that I couldn't make out. Then something sprayed out of it. I still couldn't tell what it was. Then a chunk hit me. I reached at it. it felt foamy, like, like the soap in some bathrooms. Then I passed out. Drew didn't understand. How could Zaspo not be there? He scanned the room. Nothing he could see was out of place. Except, the vent! It was too big! Big enough for a person, but, it was screwed in. Tight. He sighed. Then something he hadn't expected happened. The vent came right out automaticly. A sprinkler fell into the room. It started spraying, foam? Like, like, he couldn't think of anything like it. Then he passed out. Zaspo, as it turns out, had not met the person. She had used her fingernail to undo the screws and climbed in. She was currently crawling through the vent and trying to find the exit. Currently it wasn't going so well. She was trying to move, but it seemed never ending. Just to make things better, her muscles were wearing out on her. She knew she couldn't go much farther when she saw light. The new found glory gave her extra strength. She pushed, and pushed, and realized where it was coming from. FIRE! She tried to turn around, but couldn't. She was stuck. And the fire was getting closer. She screamed. Just then a face popped through. A face looking straight at her. The person dropped something in a hole and fell in. She left something behind. Her backpack she had been carrying was caught on a hook! Zaspo grabbed it and moved on. When I woke up I thought I was hallucinating. I saw two people standing over me. It was… Drew and Zaspo? Where had they come from? I looked at them. "Hello?" I managed. "Shhh.. I still don't understand how you're still alive. It's some sort of miracle." Zaspo told me. I tried to get up, but Zaspo pushed me back down. "It's ok. You need to rest. We'll tell you everything later." She left. Drew sat by me. "If you could see yourself, you'd understand why." He told me.I tried to get up. I fell back down. By this time, I had felt so much pain, that pain just felt normal right now. "I need to help." I said. Drew turned to me. "You're right. We should probably, or I should… uh, tell you why we are worried. Why you shouldn't be here." I was confused. What did he mean? I wasn't supposed to, huh? "Well, here I begin. I was in a cell when, uh, a thing fell in and sprayed me with foam, and it made me faint." Drew began "Me too. Or, the foam." I interrupted. "So, when I woke up I was in a different room. It had three hallways branching out. They looked like they went on forever." He continued. "Then, how did you get out?" I asked "Stop interrupting and I'll get to that." He replied. "So, I decided to call out. I yelled, hello? At first I didn't hear anything but, then I got a reply. A reply I didn't understand. I heard, run! Your life depends on it! You must escape! Only you can help! I was confused. Help by running away? Then I heard another voice. It said, translation. You are currently advised to run away waving your arms loudly and screaming like a little girl. So, I ran. Also, yes. When I saw the end of the hallway I chose, I turned around and started waving my arms and screaming like a little girl. It was some sort of evil demon. Like, a phantom. It was coming at me. When I ran back into the middle, it had transformed into a waiting room. You two and three other people I didn't recognize were sitting there. All of them but Zaspo were chanting, Turn the clock and make the wrongs right, join the world forever in flight. Over and over again. Except between each cycle was a big pause, like something was missing. It was, creepy. Then, your body collapsed. The, the, phantom thing, then came around the corner and dived straight into you. Your body shuddered, then stopped moving entirely. We thought you were gone. Then I was suddenly out of the forest. aspo was next to me too. We were laying next to each other. I asked her if she'd had a dream where Mark was attacked by a phantom like thing. She said yes. We ran back into the forest, looking for you. We did. We also saw a phantom over you. Your eyes were white, and you seemed to be struggling to fight it. Then he turned to us and, I could make out a face, he smiled, and you vanished. We walked through the forest and, came across, well, you. You were sitting there. You whispered, hello? And then collapsed. Again. That's, well, it." I stared open mouth. I, he, wait, huh? The world was spinning. What had just happened? Did I, I, I, die? A long ways away, a mysterious figure was worrying. They knew! There was only one thing to do now. He sent a mysterious puff of smoke towards them. Mark, Zaspo and Drew, forgot. Literally! Forgetting smoke. How? Well that's an upcoming story. So, let's forget about this mess for a little and think of the one at hand. OK? I looked around. We had to find out who was behind this, or we wouldn't ever escape this forest. I decided there was only one reasonable way to solve this mystery.
