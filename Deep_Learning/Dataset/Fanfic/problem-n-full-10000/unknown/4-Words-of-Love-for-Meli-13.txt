a deep breath to settle myself and felt a sweat drop slide down my temple. Damn . I discretely wiped my brow and settled to focus on the stage as they began tearing open the envelope. "There's nothing finer than hearing you two together." Mikey's slightly nasal voice caught my attention. As the audience burst into applause, I looked at him and saw nothing but sincerity. I nodded, "I love singing with him." "It shows," he said shifting slightly closer as he lowered his voice. "I did some research, getting ready for the press coverage and you know what I found?" I looked him in the eye unsure where he was going with this. "I looked all the way back to when he was doing local honky-tonk gigs. You are the only band member to be with him through his whole career. You were his charter band member, and here you are still with him today." He smiled with that, and I couldn't help but share his smile, nudging him with my shoulder. My heart warmed with pride for my man as they announced Emmett McCarty as Best Male Vocalist and the crowd stood to their feet as he climbed the stairs once again, but this time from the front row. He motioned for them to take their seats and the room grew quiet with anticipation. He stood there in the center of the universe, and I was just beginning to fear he was struggling under the weight of the spotlight when he spoke. "I can't tell you how much your generous notice of my music has meant to me." He paused, organizing his words and continued, "Singing on stage has always been as much fun as singing on my Uncle C's porch back home. As long as it continues to hold that much appeal, you'll be hearing my music for a long time to come. I thank you." The crowd began to clap, but he held up his hand to silence them. He looked over to our seats and locked eyes on me. "Rosie?" I felt the cameras focus on me, but I smiled back at him,"—all of this—" he waved his trophy over the stage and audience, "—it just wouldn't do without you." With my heart in my throat, I nodded as a tear rolled down my cheek. As the audience thundered around us, Mickey squeezed my hand. "Come on; let's meet our boy back stage before the media gets a hold of him." I squeezed his hand, glad to have him with me. ~o0o~ Mickey's assistant led me through the throng of well-wishers, parting the sea with an armload of trophies. I made it to the edge of the makeshift stage and looked out to a sea of cameras. I took two steps back as my mouth dried to a desert. A slender hand running over my shoulder and down my arm made me turn. She smiled knowingly at me, and I could breathe again. Mickey slapped my back and moved around me to get everything lined up for my backstage interviews. Rosie turned me to her and stepped into my space with a smile. I softened, smiling back as my hand rested on her hip pulling her closer. She seemed to fall under the shadow of my hat as she leaned into me. She ran her hands over my beard before resting them on my chest. "Just a couple of days and we'll be back home." I nodded, the hope of some free time galvanizing me to face the onslaught of cameras and questions. "We'll take the horses up to the ridge. It's so pretty this time of year." She said softly as she tucked my hair behind my ear. I smiled and added, "You'll pack a picnic?" She leaned back and laughed but my hand on her hip held her to me. "Cold chicken and potato salad?" she asked with a lift of her brow. I smiled contentedly, "Yeah, that'll do just fine." ~o0o~ I watched Rose and Emmett from across the media room stage. My chest tightened as I watched her run her hands down his beard, soothing the bear of a man. She took a paper from his coat pocket and tore it in half before throwing it over her shoulder, making him laugh. I shifted my feet in frustration. I wanted the kind of control and contentment Emmett had. I watched Mickey James orchestrating the people around Emmett. He worked his tail off all night to keep Emmett free of distractions. My manager worked every bit as hard as James did. That was not what I was missing. Blackwater Records had been a great label for Emmett's last three albums, but my label had carried me all the way. No, it was not my label. Our careers paths were very different. He built his career steadily over twenty years. Everything came at me so fast that I never had a moment to get my priorities straight, maybe that's why I still felt so out of balance. I looked up to see Emmett walking on stage with an arm full of trophies, towing his wife behind him. "Emmett, can you take your hat off for the photos?" someone hollered. "No," he said, and the room laughed. "Can you lift your chin?" the same voice asked seeking compromise. Emmett smiled shyly and lifted his head bring his eyes out of the shadow and the room filled with whirs and clicks. I watched as Rose stood next to Emmett as the cameras flashed. She was so beautiful under the stage lights. Watching her, I knew what I needed to bring balance and meaning to my chaos. Taking one more look at the stage, I fled the crowded room and pulled out my phone. A sleepy voice answered, "Jazzy?" I smiled with relief washing over me as I leaned my head against the brick wall and felt the seismic shift as my world fell into place.
