past. "Thalia!" Annabeth called. She was standing just outside her cabin, apparently she hadn't seen me yet. I ducked behind a group of campers and kept moving to the woods. Black spots danced in front of my eyes. I was in agony, pain radiating down my spine and throughout my body. I was ten feet from the woods. "Thalia, wait!" Annabeth yelled. She had spotted me. 'Just a little further...' Satyrs and campers alike stared at Annabeth then at me. I plunged into the woods. I stumbled and tripped over unseen obstacles. Low light and tear-blurred vision made moving nearly impossible. Finally the pain overwhelmed me. I collapsed; wanting to sob, but in too much pain. Tears fell silently down my cheeks. The pain continued to pulse throughout my trembling body. "Thalia? Thalia?" I heard Annabeth getting closer. "Oh my gods! Thalia!" Suddenly she was next to me. "Jason! Jason, I found her!" She shouted. 'Jason? Oh no, not him! He can't know!' Jason raced towards us. "Oh gods.. She doesn't look good." I moaned. 'Is "Oh gods" all they can say?' "Jason, you have to carry her. We need to get her to the infirmary and get some ambrosia and nectar in her, stat!" He nodded in agreement. He picked me up gently, but pain still flared in my back. "No... Don't worry about me.." I whispered. "Sorry Thalia, not going to happen. You're pale, glassy-eyed, in a lot of pain, and close to losing conciousness. We're taking you to the infirmary." Annabeth said sternly. "Percy was.. right... you are stubborn.." I gasped out. Annabeth cracked a small, grim smile. "What happened to her?" Jason asked Annabeth, as they raced me to the Big House. "Tell you later, after we take care of her." She turned to me. "Just hang on Thalia. Hang on." I was barely conscious. Next thing I knew, I was lying in a bed with Jason looking down at me. His eyes were a brilliant blue, like the sky in the middle of a beautiful summer day. "It's ok, Thalia. We got you." He said. Everything went black. ~*~*O*~*~ Third POV: "Ok so what happened?" Jason asked. Annabeth looked shaken but she quickly filled him in on what had happened. "She took your pain away? How is that possible?" Jason could tell Annabeth's gears were turning. She started pacing. "She's not claimed... I've never heard of anyone with powers like this... Where is Marco?!" Soon a well-built Apollo kid with dirty blonde hair hurried in. "There you are! What took you so long?!" She asked angrily. Marco flinched. He knew what Annabeth was capable of. "Sorry." He murmured. "What's wrong with her?" Annabeth and Jason glanced at each other. "We don't know." Jason said truthfully. Marco blinked. He stood at Thalia's bedside and held his palms over her. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Suddenly, he flew backward and slammed into the wall. He groaned as he slid to the floor. Jason and Annabeth stared in shock. "What in Hades' name was that?" She asked. Marco moaned again. "I've never... I've never felt so much pain in one person. I don't know who she is or where she came from but... If she can endure this kind of pain.." He shook his head. "She's the strongest half-blood I've ever met." All three turned to look at Thalia. That's when Chiron entered. "Who is injured? Oh.. Oh dear." He sighed. "Who did she heal?" "She healed me, Chiron." Annabeth said. "Who is she? Percy told me about her before he... Disappeared. But even he didn't know much about her. And what exactly did she do? To me, I mean." Chiron looked at her sadly. "Why don't you back to your activities Marco? Thank you for your assistance." Marco was still stunned from what had happened. He nodded and stumbled out the door. "I'm afraid Thalia has it difficult. More so than most. I don't know everything, as she is reserved. I couldn't even tell you her real name, as I do not know it. Thalia Bolt is the name she took for herself, after Jason's sister. She still has not been claimed, which is odd. Then again, no one has really heard from the gods lately. Being only fifteen years of age, she has a large burden to bear. Thalia can sense and remove pain from people, physical or emotional. But in doing so, she must pull the pain into her own body. When someone is hurting, their pain draws her to them. All she has to do to remove the pain is speak to them or touch them." "But... What about her? She just.. Takes the pain? Why? Why not just refuse?" Jason asked. Chiron's shoulders sagged. "Alas, she cannot. But even if she could, I doubt she would." He smiled sadly. "She has a big heart and a strong will." "She didn't know me, not really. Just from what Percy said. Yet she healed me without complaining. She mentioned something about Percy being the only who talked to her?" Chiron nodded. "Unfortunately the other campers are scared of her. Yet they do not know of her power. Even I don't know how far her abilities extend... Perhaps it would be good if you were to befriend her, Jason?" "What about me?" Annabeth asked, slightly offended that Chiron seemed to overlook her. "I'm sorry my dear. But untill you are... feeling better, I don't think you should be too close to her." Annabeth flushed. "I didn't mean too! I didn't think anyone knew where I was..." "I know, child. Percy's disappearance took a toll on everyone. You especially. Thalia will be fine. Now, I think it's time you joined your siblings. Jason, will you watch over her?" He nodded. "I will see you both at supper." With that, Chiron wheeled himself out. Annabeth reluctantly followed. Jason sat down on a chair by Thalia's bedside, content to wait. So? Want to know more about my adventure?
