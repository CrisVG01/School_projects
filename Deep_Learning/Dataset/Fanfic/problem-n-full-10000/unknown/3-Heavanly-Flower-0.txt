early, but I needed some peace and quiet. And to make sure that I got some maybe I could get ahead of the book. I told them to drop me off and I ran down that hill. I ran to the small cottage and knocked. "Who are you?" I believe Annabeth Chase said as she opened the door. "Well I'm guessing you're expecting a boy my age and some kind of, oh I don't know, hero," I said. She looked at me like I was crazy. I rolled my eyes. "I'm a friend of Chiron's. I need to talk to him about that special 'hero'." "Oh. Um. Okay. Chiron," she called over her shoulder. "A girl says she needs to talk to you," she called. I rolled my eyes again. "You make me sound like I'm five years younger than you. When I'm your age, " I said to her. I rolled my eyes again. "Eh," she shrugs. I rolled my eyes and a new guy, not Chiron, came up to me. "Oh you've got to be kidding me!" I yell. I walked back to the stairs of the cottage and sit on them. I know who this is. His name is Luke Castellan. "Hey, what's your problem?" Luke asked. "Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I just...oh I don't know…. need to talk to Chiron ." "Well he isn't here," Luke said. Luke was the bad guy. I know that. So I'm not even gonna try to make friends with him. "Are you gonna say anything?" Luke asked. "Can you leave me alone? I'm gonna wait for Chiron," I told him harshly. "Whoa. Look girly. Did I do something to make you hate me?" Luke asked. I groaned. "It's not what you did it's what you're going to do," I told him, quietly. "Meaning?" Luke asked. I growled and turned my head to him. I gasped quietly. He was super close. Maybe I should at least be friends with him, I thought. I turned my head. "S-Sorry. I'm not used to have a guy want to be my friend or at least the decency to respect me. All the guys I've known are friends of Trevor," I said. "Who's Trevor?" Luke asked. I smiled and looked at him. "You'll literally never know," I laughed. He smiled at my laugh. It was peaceful. He grabbed my hand and kissed it. "Wanna go inside?" Luke asked. My smile faded. "Um….I'm pretty sure I'm not a demigod. Or a nymph," I said. "Really? Weird. Because if you aren't a demigod why have you been able to cross the barrier?" Luke asked. "Wait. Where's the barrier line?" I asked. "Just in front of this cabin," Luke said. "Maybe it's the book….." I muttered. I smiled at Luke and stood up. He smiled and brought her inside the cabin. They talked for quite a while. Then Chiron came but Luke and I were still talking so I didn't bother to break the conversation. That is, until Percy showed up with Grover in his hands. Annabeth opened the door as they fainted. "Hey, come on. Let's see what this dude has on him," Luke said. I laughed and followed him. Luke searched him as I just kept laughing. "Dang it. All he has is this horn of a minotaur." Luke put it back and we waited till he woke up. "So Leila. What exactly are you doing here?" Annabeth asked. "No, correction. What are you?" "Right now, to be honest I don't know. I'm sure Chiron would know though," I said and eyed Chiron warily. "This time, I do not. I suspected you to be a human. But maybe you aren't," Chiron said studying me. "Well… till we figure that out, I need to keep an eye on him," I said looking at the sleeping Percy. "Why?" Annabeth asked. "Because I'm not from this world. Well. At least I think so. My friend gave me these," I showed them the books. "I was sucked into the book the moment I opened it. To be honest… I don't think we should share this with Percy. I'm in the story. I need to make sure, I don't mess the story up entirely," I said. "And what if you can't?" Grover asked already awake. I stared at him. "Then I think I might change all you destinies massively," I said. "Yeah and that's totally reassuring," Annabeth said annoyed. "Look. I've read the book. So I know…" I hesitated. "I know everything," Luke stared at me but I made it seem like I didn't know he was the bad guy. "I know every move you guys are going to make. Percy will wake up sooner or later and I have a book to play," I said. Everyone nodded and split. I stated in the cabin with Luke though. Luke grabbed my hand and pulled me into his embrace. "Before you say anything, Luke. I- I can't change your destiny so I won't tell them your plan," he sighed relieved and kissed my head. But I pulled away. "But I can't be with you. Friends? Alright. More? Not a chance," I said. "I'm not gonna make you do something that you don't want," Luke said. He grabbed my arm and I just stared at his hand. He walked closer. "I promise I won't hurt you though," Luke said. "Promise?" I asked. He smiled and grabbed my hand pressing it firmly but gently to his lips. "Promise," he said. I smiled at him but heard my name being called. I pulled away, and opened the back door of the cabin. There. I was shocked. True was standing right there . I'm sorry I didn't update my story of "Confusion" I didn't have access to my story to update. I will try and update soon. If you haven't read "Confusion" then it's a Girl Meets World Fanfic. About a complicated triangle of Maya Lucas and Charlie. Anyways got to go. Peace out ✌ -Heavanly Flower
