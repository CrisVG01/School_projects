lips back here." She giggles. "Later, City. I really do need to finish this. Thank ya. I'm better now." She goes back to baking while I head into the living room to watch some TV. I offered to pick Kate and Tanya up at the airport, but they refused, saying they were renting a car. Bella is just having a seat next to me, after finishing up in the kitchen, when we hear the car doors. I take Bella's hand in mine as we open the front door to see Kate and Tanya making their way up the steps and onto the porch. "Edward, I missed you so much!" Bella backs away slightly as Kate runs and jumps in my arms. She's almost as small as my spitfire, but still nearly knocks me on my ass. "I missed you too. I'm so glad you could make it." I let her go and reach for Bella's hand, pulling her back to my side. Kate grabs Tanya and pulls her forward. "Kate, Tanya, this is my Bella. Baby, this is Kate and her partner Tanya." Bella puts her hand out. "Nice to meet ya … again." Kate ignores her hand and grabs her in a hug. "I'm so sorry that I fucked things up last time we met. I felt just awful once I realized—" Bella cuts her off. "Please, don't even think about it again." She leans close to Kate and whispers loud enough for us all to hear. "It was his fault anyway." Kate lets out one of her loud laughs and I know immediately that she's going to have a blast with Bella. "Oh, I'm really going to like you. Anyone that can have that man running around like he was that day and doesn't mind putting him in his place is an automatic friend of mine." "Yeah, yeah. You two can kiss my ass. Come on Tanya. You're definitely my favorite person tonight." I put my arm around her and we all head inside. The night goes really great, and as expected Bella, Kate and Tanya get along famously. If anything, I'm the odd man out … literally. At the end of the night, Kate asks to speak to me while Bella shows Tanya to their room. I lead her out to the back deck. We grab a seat in the porch swing, me with a beer and her with a glass of wine. "This is really nice, Edward. I thought you were crazy for moving here, but seeing you with Bella and how happy you are, it's clear this was the right move for you." "It was. I can't even explain it, but I feel more comfortable here in six months than I've ever felt anywhere. Of course, I miss you and Tanya and my parents." "Maybe Tanya and I will visit more. Especially after we have our baby. This is the perfect place for children." I freeze, halting the swing. "Your baby?" Looking over at her, she has a bigger smile on her face than I've seen in a long time. "Yep. We found another donor, and we're going forward." I lean over, hugging her tightly. "I'm so fucking glad. No one deserves this more. So give me all the details." She goes on to tell me that Tanya asked her brother, Eleazar. Initially, they didn't think to ask him because I was willing and seemed like the right choice. After I had fallen through, they decided to ask him. He already has three children with his wife, Carmen. Everyone discussed it, and after thinking it over, he and Carmen agreed. "Even though I was looking forward to a red-headed baby, this is actually perfect because now the baby will have the closest thing to Tanya's DNA." "I'm really happy for you both. I can't wait to meet your little one, and of course, you're welcome anytime. You know you always have a place with me." Then I smooth my hands over my hair. "Seriously, though, I'm not a fucking red-head." Bella and Tanya find us laughing. I let Bella in on the news and congratulate Tanya before we finally all call it a night and head to bed. . . The next six month's fly by and before I know it, it's been a year since I moved here. Kate called Bella and me last week to announce they were finally pregnant. It took two rounds of Invitro, but they found out the second round took. My work is great. Everyone has taken to me and I'm currently thinking of expanding the practice. As for Bella … Well, tonight I'm asking her to marry me. I spoke with Charlie privately the other day, hoping to convince him to consider living with us, knowing Bella would never want to leave her dad alone. He was happy and actually relieved that I was asking her. He confided that he had planned on talking to Bella about Sue moving in so this would work perfectly. Shaking my hand, he made me promise always to give her the life she deserves. I readily agreed and plan to live up to that promise forever. Who would have known all it would take is a deer to change my life completely ? When I first crashed my car and ended up stranded in a little nowhere town, I thought it was just another piece of shitty luck in the life of Edward Cullen. If someone had told me then it would be the answer to everything, I would've laughed in their fucking face. Now, I'm convinced ending up here, finally finding my place, was destiny. Thanks to that deer, I'm exactly where I was always meant to be. Fran beta'd, and Judyblue, 2browneyes and Vampiregirl93 pre-read. Please feel free to leave words of love and encouragement for Meli in your review. I know we all want to send her our thoughts and prayers and let her know we're thinking of her.
