him, insisting it was important and grudgingly I gave in. We did not speak on the way and I was once again lost in my own world. It wasn't until the car came to a stop that I came out of my revere and realised where we were. There was Jacob standing right in front of me in the middle of the road. I turned to face Edward a silent question in my eyes, he nodded and smiled a sad smile. It was all I needed before I hurled myself out of the car. I stopped inches before Jacob aware of the meters of bandages that circled the left side of his body and around his torso. This close I could see that beneath his russet skin he was grey, his eyes were cloudy and dilated, his lips dry and sweat was rolling off his body as he shook. What on earth was he doing out of bed? He looked ready to faint at any point. 'Jacob' I whisperd, cupping my hand around his cheek. 'Hey Bells' he returned a feeble smile that was a shadow of his usual blinding grin. 'What are you doing here? You should be in bed' I exclaimed. 'I'll let him explain' he replied nodding toward Edward. I spun having temporarily forgotten Edward. He stood behind me and I was aware that at present I stood exactly in the middle of Jacob and Edward. The realisation flustered me but I could not move without drawing attention to my predicament and besides I didn't know where I would want to move. My head hurt with thoughts like these so I turned my focus back to Edward to find out what exactly we were all doing here. 'Ok, Bella I want you to hear this through before you make any sort of decision' he started and I nodded nervously. 'Ever since the battle and you made your choice you've been really unhappy and it is clear that you miss Jacob. Yes?' He asked and I nodded again. 'You weren't able to answer my question earlier and I think that's because you don't know the answer. If we are going to be together Bella I want you to be one hundred percent sure. At the minute half of the time you are in a world of your own and it is clear you are thinking of Jacob' he continued and I blushed red, confused and worried as to where this conversation was going. Had they decided that it wasn't fair that I loved both of them and so I should have neither of them? My heart hammered at the thought. 'Jacob and I have had an idea...' 'No, Edward has had an idea' Jacob intervened as Edward glared at him. 'Ok, yes I have had an idea, I think, and don't freak out, I think that it might be worthwhile if you dated both Jacob and I...' I spluttered incoherently at this and Edward persevered. 'Bella, you don't love one of us more than the other, you love us equally, don't you?' He pressed and I cowered inside, this was the defining reason that I had chosen Edward, because I loved him more and now he was forcing me to admit that that was not the truth. When I did that there would be no separating him and Jacob, they would be on the same plinth and then how was I supposed to know what to do. 'Bella?' Jacob questioned and when I looked up into his pain clouded face I knew the game was up; 'Yes, I love you both equally' I whispered looking at him and then tearing my eyes to look at Edward. This was hell on earth. I felt like I was betraying Edward but he merely smiled a sad, knowing smile. 'We know that Bella but you need to choose one of us, the only fair way to do that is for you to split your time between the two of us for a while until you can make a definite, informed decision. Neither of us want half of you Bella, we want you to be with us fully without pining for the other. This way gives you time to understand who is right for you and it gives us a fair chance.' He finished and I sucked in deep breaths at his suggestion. 'Jacob, what do you think of this?' I asked, playing for time. This was too much for me comprehend. 'It's crazy, I know that, but isn't this whole fucking thing crazy? I want a chance Bella, a proper one and if this is the only way I can get it then I'll take it' he finished. 'I don't know, this is mental, I need time to think about it' I pleaded looking from one of them to the other. 'That's fine Bella, we understand that, just let us know when you've decided' supplied Edward and I nodded in silent thanks. 'I'll take you home' he said and I blanched, drawing towards Jacob. 'Do you mind...can I go with Jacob?' I stuttered, he just looked so frail, so ill and I wanted nothing more than to put him in bed and look after him. I looked up at him and he smiled weakly. 'I'd like that' he said, his voice trembling. 'Of course Bella' said Edward although his voice was strained. I went over and gave him a tight hug, confused beyond belief despite not having made any decision. He was in the car and away in minutes and it was only then that I went over to Jacob and wrapped my hand around his sweat drenched torso.
