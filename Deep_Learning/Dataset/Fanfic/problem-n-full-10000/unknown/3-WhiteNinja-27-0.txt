around together, testing, dancing. He let his hands slip down lower, onto my ass. I held my tongue from squealing as he squeezed them firmly. He groaned into my lips. I grabbed a tuft of his hair and pulled him even closer to me. Eagerly, he pushed his hips into mine and I felt a bulge poked me in between my legs. ***TRIGGER WARNING*** Immediately, I pulled away. I just stared at him. Luke Castellan. He was waiting for me. Was he actually here? In front of me? Waiting for me to be his? I so wanted to be his. But not this way. Not while he's on the drug that caused the both of us so much heartache. I regained my senses and pulled away from him slowly. "Luke. I really like you. But we can't do this right now. Let's go to sleep, okay?" I push past him and head for the door. I felt his hand grab mine gently. He pulls me back close to him. His hands on my cheeks, his eyes glazed, but sincere, "Annabeth, please I'm lonely. Make me feel like I'm not alone." "Luke. You're drunk. I'll be in the living room whenever you need me, okay? Wash up and go to sleep." I turn around again. But this time, he won't let me. I don't know if I screamed. It all felt so unreal. Like a dream on mute. But was it a dream? Or a nightmare? She never left the room. He was drunk. But he was bigger than her. And the alcohol did not deter him. He didn't need to close the door, because he knew no one would come running. he knew no one would hear. No one would hear her screams. He pinned her onto his bed, where he also pinned down Alice. Fuck Alice. Fuck Alice for leaving. Fuck Alice . He tried to get her back. But she wouldn't let him even try. For months he tried getting her back after she upped and left him. He only got drunk every once in a while. Alice was a cunt. She couldn't even handle him when he was mad. How was she supposed to get into any relationship, if she can't even handle an angry man? I tried my best , he thought to himself, as he pulled off his shirt from the girl's torso. I bought her a ring. Ready to marry her. But she wouldn't accept me. Only Annabeth. Only Annabeth accepts me. Before he continued his prowl, he took a swig of the half-empty vodka bottle on his bedside. The girl was frozen. She couldn't move. Did he hurt her? Not yet. Did he hurt her? He already did. One hand on the bottle, he used his other hand to undo his pants. He fumbled, his head was pounding from the alcohol. He downed the rest of the vodka and tossed aside the bottle. He moaned in relief as he finally bulge finally came out. He was hard. So damn hard. He wouldn't have had to pin the girl down if she just relented. She was such a tease. Making out with him and not going all the way. He stuck his tongue out in concentration as he pulled down his boxers and stroked his cock. "Alrighty. Let's see what you've got in store for me." He pulled down his shorts from the girls hips. She lay vulnerable in front of him. Naked and nude. Her eyes glassy, with a faraway look in them. He towered over her precious essence and stuck a finger into her. She was wet. "I knew you wanted me," he whispered his slurred words into her ear, as he slowly stuck his hard rough cock tip into her. She arched her back from the pain. She was a virgin. But he did not know this. Ecstatic by her reaction, he pushed his weight all the way in. In. In. In. An audible tear came from her underneath. He didn't hear it. But it was the only thing she heard. The sound of that ripping and her own scream. She screamed. Multiple times. "Oh baby, yes, I scream for me, oh yessss.." He thrusted his unwanted cock into her. In. Out. In. Out. "This is what you wanted, right?" Thrust. ""You wanted me?" Thrust. "Now you got it." Thrust. "I'm gonna fuck you all night baby." Thrust. "You're gonna fuckin' love it." Thrust. She stared at the door. It was right there. She could have left. She could have ran. Why didn't she run? Did she want him to rip away her virginity after all? He was the one she wanted to save herself for. But no. Not like this. "Baby, why are you making that face?" He asked, still drunkenly thrusting his hips into her relentlessly. He peppered her face with his lovely kisses. Because he knew how much she loved his kisses. Gentle, sexy, supple. "Are you okay?" In, out, in, out, in. She never thought how much she would grow to hate hearing those words. "Oh my god, fuck, I'm gonna cum!" Already too tired, too wasted, too reckless, he laid on top of her. As his body shivered and he released his own essence into her own essence. Without her permission. He rolled over next to her. His polo and jacket still on. He loosened his tie and stripped off of his garments. He laid the blanket over the both of them and kissed her on the forehead. "I had a great time, baby. Thank you." He rested his head on her shoulder. He locked his arms around her, her hand on her inner thigh and the other on her hip. She was still looking at the door. Her escape. ***END OF TRIGGER WARNING*** She managed to croak out, "Fuck you." But he was already asleep. A/N: Tune in next week for the next installment Chapter 2: Calypso. I think you can guess what's that about!
