start setting up for Reggie's party." "You don't need to worry about getting up," Emmett spoke. "I talked to Rose before I left with Jasper. Everyone else is going to come early and start cooking and setting up as quiet as possible so that you don't have to worry about it." "Thank you, Emmett. Come on Edward. Grab Reggie, I want to sleep." "Of course, love. Thank you, everyone." I picked up our sleeping daughter carefully before following Bella down the hall to our room. I waited until Bella was changed and in bed before placing Reggie in between us, then changing and crawling in with them. It wasn't long until I nodded off with my girls. The day had completely exhausted me. ~*~UHS~*~ This year's party had been a huge success. I smiled as I relaxed in the bath while I waited for Bella to say goodnight to the kids. Everyone had left Bella, Reggie and me alone for as long as they could. But once Chuck came home that ended. He couldn't wait to see his "Weggie" and to make sure she was all right. He stopped dead in the door when he saw not only his mother's wings but Reggie's too. "Oh Weggie, you gonna be able to fly like Momma?" Reggie giggled. "One day, Chucky." She walked over to him and gave him a big hug. "Thank you for helping me yesterday." "Lubs you, Weggie. Now comes fly!" He pulled her out of our room, down the stairs and out the back door where people were setting up for her party. "Fly Weggie, Fly!" Bella and I watched from our window as they ran around the yard together with Reggie flapping her wings and making her little brother giggle. She'd flap and then jump much to his enjoyment because he thought she was taking off from the ground. ' It makes my heart happy to see their close bond.' "Me too, love. Let's go celebrate our first-born. She's earned it today." ' She has. I guess we know what school she's going to now.' Bella laughed in her head. "Guess so. But we'll discuss that later." She looked at me through her lashes. 'I think the bath would be the perfect place for this conversation, later.' And so it was. After a perfect day celebrating our fist born it was now time to relax with a glass of wine, a warm bath, and conversation. We had some decisions to make but they were all good ones. I was brought out of my thoughts by a naked Bella sauntering her way into the bathroom with two glasses of wine and a saucy smile on her face. "Comfortable, baby?" "I'll be much more so when you get your beautiful behind in here Bella." Bella smiled as she placed the glasses on the edge of the tub before she climbed in and sat between my legs. 'Mmm. This is so nice after the last couple of days.' ' It is, my sweet. I guess we have some things to talk about.' Bella nodded. 'I think the school discussion is done, though. Reggie needs to be in the Angel School System.' ' She does, there's no doubt about it.' We continued to converse silently. It was what we did when we relaxed in the bath. It seemed we had a mutual agreement about that. We talked Reggie, Chuck and whether moving to Eden was a good idea. We spoke at length about the commute, not only for me but for her, because she still had her work to do on Earth as well. ' What if we stayed here but you took her to the rainbows every morning. We could organize for one of our family members to meet her in the rainbow room and take her to school.' I suggested. ' Not on her first week.' Bella sniffled, which caused me to spin her around so I could see her face. "What is it, sweet girl?" I asked aloud because I couldn't make sense of her thoughts. "My baby girl won't be with me anymore!" she wailed, before bursting into loud sobs. "She's…growing…up…She's…not…my…baby…anymore!" "Oh, Bella." I didn't know this was going to bother her so much. I pulled her to me and let her get it all out. Once she had calmed down, I spoke again, "She will always be your baby, just like luck Chucky will as he grows older. Nothing will ever change that." She nodded but remained quiet, both in thought and in voice. Bella, now sitting sideways across my lap because our tub is just that wide, smiled against the side of my throat where her head was resting on my shoulder. "Are you happy, Edward?" I jerked back in surprise, her head popping up from its resting place, for us to look at each other. "Of course, I am, what kind of question is that?" I asked rather harshly. "Well, because it seems we're breaking Angel Lore all over the place lately and I wondered. Well that, and because I'm wondering if you're ready to do it all over again?" That question made me pause because she'd asked me that very same question three years ago when she told me about being pregnant with Chucky. "Bella are you saying what I think you're saying?" my hand landing on her belly. She smiled that beautiful smile, the one that captured me when we first met, the one I'll love forever because it's just mine. "I am Edward. The Gods have seen fit to bless us with another miracle. Now please, are you happy?" I could see that she wasn't asking about our life, she was asking if I was happy she was once again pregnant. "If I were any more joyous, sweetheart, I'd be floating. I can't wait to do it all over again." With that, I pulled her to straddle my lap and show her just how happy I was. My life was perfect.
