felt like something wasnt right , something was missing i looked around me but everyone was there, for a moment i thought we were being watched so i looked all around but all i could see was a few couples walking along the beach and there was only a cab on the road heading for port angelies but something wasnt right, it was just then that i remembered, Leah. What if something has happened to her she is on her own she may not be defensless but she is alone i had to get to her, I stood and ran towards my mum, i thought its best not to worry her. '' Hey mom im just going to check on Leah i will be back soon love you '' Before she could say anything in reply i turned and sprinted for the woods, it would be much quicker if i phased, as soon as i could see the edge of the woods i pulled my clothes off by the time i got to the woods my clothes and shoes where tied around my neck and i quickly phase, i couldnt hear anyone in my head which means that Leah was still in human form i ran as fast as i could untill i picked up the scent of the house i phased back, got dressed and hurtled towards the house. There were no lights on this is strange she said she was coming home, I opened the door and stepped inside '' Leah '' there was no answer '' Leah are you down here '' there was still no answer panic started to kick in as i raced up the stair opened her bedroom door and what i saw teared my heart to pieces. There was nothing there No clothes, no pictures, no shoes none of her belongings and no Leah. I turned and ran downstairs and thats when i saw it, on the counter where four letters each with a different name on it one had mom and Billys one had Jacob one had Sam and the final one was addressed to me before even thinking i toke the letter addressed to me and ripped it open i noticed it was Leahs Handwriting, that calmed me a little and i began to read it : Dear Seth, How are you doing ? probably not a good question to ask so im just going to get right to it. Im so sorry it has happened like this you are my little brother and i love you with all my heart. Im sorry i didnt tell you but i had to go, Dont panic not for long just a little see i have not been myself for a long time, i hate that no one likes me i know i have changed a lot but with the cercomstances i think i could be a lot worse, the thing is i dont want to live like this anymore so i had to get away i think that traveling will help me find myself. I love the life i have and will be forever greatful that i was one of the choosen few to protect the entire tribe, never in my wildest dreams did i think this would happen to someone like me, But i have to see the world and in doing so i am hoping it will help me find myself , The me i lost years ago. Im sorry if i have upset you by doing so but please understand my reasons for choosing this and it had to be done this way it was much easier if no one new until i had gone. If you are wondering where i am going i will be visiting grandma in Greece first and stay there for a whille but after that im not sure, i need some sence of adventure, as much as i love what i do and who i am i want to find normality i want to find a place where i am not going to be judged be anyone i wanted a place where my reality is peoples fairy tales please forgive me Seth i love you with all my heart little brother Forever and Always your sister Leah x It was then that i realised the tears streaming down my face, She has gone. Leah my big sister has just packed her things and left without a word. As much as i was annoyed at her for what she had done i was scared, i had never even gone a day without my sister me and we were like a team us against the world, with mom having Billy me and Leah only had eachother and now she was gone, I had to tell everyone, I had to get back to the bonfire and left everyone now Still clutching my letter, the only evidence i had that the last 15 minutes had happened, i ran, i ran as fast as i could not bothering to phase i just ran, i could feel the burn in my legs but carried on i had to and soon i could see the glow of the fire, i was close i didnt now what else to do to get everyones attentions so i just screamed and sure enough by the time i had reached them they all looked at me every one of them with a worried expression etched on there face, my chest hurt alot from running so i said the only words i could manage '' Leah Gone '' I thrust the letter i was still clutching to Billy and he read it, from then on everything was just blurred, partly because the tears had started again pouring down my face like a waterfall but mainly because my brain couldnt function all i could think of was that Leah was gone and i didnt now when she would be back or if she would come back at all.
