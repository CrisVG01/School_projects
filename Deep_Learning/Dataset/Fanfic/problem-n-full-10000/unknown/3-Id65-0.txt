know." He says. He taps his radio. "You gotta be kidding me." I say. Leo smirks. "I can hear. So if Percy Like falls out we can find him." Leo says. "Repair boy? Is wise girl a pancake?" Jason's voice says. "No sparky, she's fine." Leo says. "How mad is she?" Percy's voice says. "I will snap both of you in half" I say. Laughter, and I smile. "Seaweed we should ditch. Suburbs up ahead" Leo says. "I agree. And let's find some with full tanks this time?" Percy asks. Click. Leo shakes his head and presses a button. "What are we doing?" I ask. "Going car shopping. And shopping. We never have enough clothes" Leo says. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER I stand looking around the abandoned street. "Look for a good car" Percy says. I point to a dark blue Mercedes Minivan "how about that?" I ask. He nods. "Nice choice. Jason, raid and look for keys." Percy says. "Come with me. Leo go with charity and look in some of the houses for medicine and supplies" Percy orders. "Charity won't-"I begin. "She'll be fine. It's safe" Percy says. And with that He sprints up the street. I follow. "What are we looking for?" I ask. He points to an overgrown house with a Porsche parked in the driveway. "Come on" He says. He looks around, and finds a key. We enter. The drapes let in a small amount of light, And it's really dusty in here. "Let's go" he says. I wander down the hall until I find a bathroom. I look around it. Quite small. No medicine cabinet- wait. I tap the mirror. Hollow. I find the release and open it. "Bingo" I jump and see Percy holding a backpack behind me. He enters, and in the cramped space, I could swear there's electricity. He loads up the backpack. "Past there dates, but everything is" he says referring to the meds. I open the shower curtain. I hand him the body wash and shampoo. He study's it and nods. "Good idea" He says. "That's why you need a girl with you guys" I say. He nods. "Maybe. But you'd be away from your sister" He says. I nod. "True. Then maybe I wouldn't. But I've had to leave her alone before" I say. He smirks and then we raid the rest of the house. I stop in a girl's room. She must have been maybe my age, because she was my size. I pack all her clothes, and quite a few books. I look around. "Almost done?" he asks. "1 minute" I say. I look in the drawers of her desk. "Bingo" I say. Mimicking Percy mockingly. I pull out two boxes and put them in my bag. "What are those?" he asks. "Tampons and Pads. It's been forever since anyone's had some" I say. Percy wrinkles his nose. "Boys" I mutter. "I'm a Man! Don't you mean Men?" He asks as we exit and jog down the street to load the supplies in the car. "No. I mean Boys." I say. We argue as we raid the rest of the street. By the time we get back to the car Leo is on the Radio with someone. "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Are they about to kiss? Because I can feel the sexual tension from here." Pinecones voice says. "No!" I say as Percy says "Yes" I shove him. "Where's Charity?" I ask. Leo nods to the car. I hear Taylor swift Blasting. "Good. Pinecone I found Tampons" I say. I hear Pinecone sigh. "Thank. God. It's been months since we've had any. Boy's never seem to find any and we girls never go on missions" Pinecone says. "I agree." I say. "Men" Percy says. I sigh. "Boys" "Men" "Boys" "Men" "Boys" I'm only doing this because it keeps his mind occupied. "I'm 22. I think I qualify as a Man" Percy says "I'm 21. I still don't think you qualify." I say. Percy smirks "You sure don't qualify as mature" He says. I throw my hands up. "Male gender." I say. Pinecone laughs "I'm going to go talk to Charity" I say. With that I leave them to talk. I climb in and turn down the music. Charity sits in the middle row. "You good?" I ask her. She nods. "These people are ok right?" She asks. "Yeah. There good, as far as I can tell. Now there's more of us- but we're still a family" I say. She nods again. "Why won't you let me use a weapon?" Charity asks. I tuck some of her hair behind her ear. "Because. I promised Dad. And for as long as you can, I want to keep that promise. But- I guess I'll have to teach you some more moves" I say sighing. She smiles. "Thanks Annabeth" she says. Then she hugs me. I smile. "Ready to pack up and go?" Percy asks from behind us. I jump. "Gods you scared me half to death!" I say. "You should be more alert" He says, as He walks up the driveway and into somebody's backyard. I follow him. I lean in incredibly close to him. "I am. Your heartbeat just increased in speed, Leo is trying to ignite a ball of lint with a paperclip, and Jason is giving Charity a dagger" I say. He stares down at me, and I am acutely aware of 2 things. He's taller than me and my heart is beating faster. "But your heart is beating even faster" Percy says. I step back and turn. "I'm giving Jason a hand if you need me" I say behind my shoulder. Percy mutters something, and then I'm back down to Jason and Charity. There we go! Chapter 1. I actually really like this idea. I also think that I did a fair job. Tell me in a review how I did?
