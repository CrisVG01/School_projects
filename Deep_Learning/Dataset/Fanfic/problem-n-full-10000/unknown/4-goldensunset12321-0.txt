only pretended too. I hate camping. "Yeah, we'll have a great time." Charlie sounded enthusiastic about it. "I know you'll be moving soon, and I want to spend some quality time with my daughter and granddaughter." Great, now he made me feel guilty. We were planning on moving away from Forks in a couple months, people were giving us strange looks since we still all look the same. "What about Edward?" I asked, curious as to why he wanted Edward to go. Him and Edward got along okay, but they weren't exactly best buds or anything. "He's my son-in-law." Charlie said. "I want to get to know him a little better." "Renesmme and me will go." I said, trying to sound happy. "I'll talk to Edward." "Thanks, Bells. I plan on us leaving early Friday morning, maybe you could spend the night here Thursday." "Sound good." "I love you, Bella." "I love you too Dad." He hung up and I slipped the phone back into my pocket and walked over to the bed. "Charlie wants to take Renesmme, Edward, and me camping." I told them with a frown. "That's sounds fun." Leah smiled. "Not so much." I replied. "I hate camping." Then I sighed and said. "He wants to spend some time with us before we have to move away." Leah's smile vanished and she said. "I will miss all of you so much." "Hey, we'll stay in touch." Alice assured her. "And Daddy already said that you, Seth, and Jake will have plane tickets to wherever we move to at a moment's notice if you want to visit us." "Why does Charlie want Edward to go?" Rosalie asked with a smirk. "He does know that even if he leaves him in the deepest parts of the woods, Edward will find his way back home." Then she frowned and said. "I know that from past experience. I've been trying to leave that boy in the woods since I met him." I laughed and said. "Charlie just wants to get to know him better." We talked for a few more moments, then I left the room and walked downstairs. I could hear Edward playing a soft tune on the piano and couldn't stop the smile that appeared on my face. Edward was sitting at the piano, his long fingers flying across the keys. Mom and Dad were sitting on the sofa, snuggled up to each other. Jasper and Seth were sitting in the floor, a chess game on the table between them. Jasper had been teaching Seth for the past few weeks how to play, and he was getting real good at it. Good enough to beat me about ninety percent of the time. Leah was also getting good at chess, but not as good as her brother. Jacob tried learning once, but quickly got bored and said he was sticking to checkers. Jacob is smart enough to learn chess, just too impatient. I walked over and sat beside Edward as he finished the song he was playing. "That was beautiful." I said, as he leaned towards me and pressed his lips against mine. "Hey!" Seth protested. "Children present." "You know where the door is." I said, as Edward and me kissed again, this time with more passion. "Carlisle." Seth said. "They are trying to warp my young impressionable mind." "I would've thought living with Jacob did that a long time ago." Edward said, as our lips parted. "Yeah, your right." Seth agreed. "Where's Nessie?" I asked. "Outside playing catch with Emmett and Jacob." Edward answered me. Then he smiled and added "She's the ball." I also smiled, that was one of Renesmme's favorite games. She would tuck herself into a ball shape, wrapping her arms around her legs and pulling them close to her body, then laugh as she is tossed back and forth. When Mom and I first saw this game we were both ready to kill Emmett and Jacob, it scared us to see Nessie being tossed around like that. But now we were used to it, we knew that they would not hurt the little girl. Nessie was not as tough as a full vampire, but she was a lot tougher then a human child. Even tougher than a full grown human man. "Charlie called." I said. "How's he doing?" My husband asked. "Fine, he want to take us camping this weekend." "Sounds like fun." Edward said. "I'm sure Ness will love to spend the weekend camping." Then he kissed me again and added. "But I will miss you." "No you won't. Charlie wants you to go too." "Why?" Edward asked, with a confused expression. "Because you are his son-in-law." I answered. "He wants to get to know you better." "Don't fall for it, Edward." Jasper said, as he slid one of his chess pieces around on the board. "He's planning on leaving you in the middle of the woods." "With a few bullet holes in your head." Seth added. "I'm not going." Edward declared with a pretend scared look on his handsome face. "He is not planning anything sinister." I laughed. Then I gave Edward my best sad eyes and poked my bottom lip out slightly. "Please come with us." "He's going." Jasper smirked. "Eddie's putty when Bella turns on the sad eyes." "I'm sorry Sweetie." Edward sighed. "But I can't go, I will be grounded." "For what?" I asked surprised. "For pulling Jasper's arm off and beating him with it. You know how Dad strongly disapproves of such actions." "Don't worry, Bella." Dad said, as he glared at Edward. "If Edward breaks any of the rules, I will just have a chat with him in my office. He may not be able to sit during the camping trip, but he will still be able to go." "Thanks Dad, you're the best." I smiled. "Yeah." Edward mumbled. "Father of the century material." 3563489563490563295632875632874532874632875639875638352598762359873645463895623589736259782463904273658934765047935698356932856349085643985604329856348956239085629340856390485693428569423856398456934865934786547398653408965384056439805634985632048965903465092835629308562096523906 Well, what do you think? I will try my best to update quickly.
