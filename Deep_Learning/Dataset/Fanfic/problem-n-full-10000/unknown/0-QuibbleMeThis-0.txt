preventing it. But this... they would surely blame him for this. Well, there was nothing for it. He'd just have to make another one. He was a dab hand at enchanting, if he did say so himself. And for all the hype about the founders they had probably been quite young when they had made the hat. He knew it had been made before Slytherin was kicked out. Why with his superior skills and advanced knowledge his hat would probably be even better than the original! Smiling delightedly at the prospect of an interesting challenge, Albus rolled up his sleeves and set to work. Two days later Dumbledore examined his new sorting hat. It looked exactly like the old one of course. He had considered making it a nice cheerful purple with an iridescent rainbow hatband, but had regretfully decided that if he did that people would probably realise it was a different hat. However he was quite proud of the enchantments. He had imbued the hat with excellent legilimantic abilities to enable it to examine the entirety of each childs personality and sort them into the correct house. The duplicitous, power-hungry, amoral, sneaky back-stabbers who were loyal only to themselves would, of course, go to Slytherin. Those who valued books and knowledge over friends and family would be sorted into Ravenclaw. All the cowardly, ineffective duffers with no real potential would take comfort in each other in their true home of Hufflepuff whilst the children who had the potential to be brave when they needed to be, who were loving and loyal to their friends and family and were willing to stand up for what they believed in, would, naturally, be placed in Gryffindor. Albus smiled and, as one final test, placed the Hat on his head. "GRYFFINDOR!" yelled the hat. Yes! It worked perfectly! No one would ever know /!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\ Third year had begun and a slightly depressed Harry Potter was sitting at the Slytherin table, waiting for the food to arrive. He was rather unhappy to be back at Hogwarts. The last three weeks had been the best of his life! He had been staying at the Leaky Cauldron, with free access to Diagon alley, and had enjoyed every minute of it. Old Tom had been very kind, making sure he ate three meals a day and keeping a friendly eye on him. Florean Foretescue had sat and spoken to him, helped him with his homework, introduced him to other customers and given him free ice-cream! No one had ever been that nice to him before! For three weeks he had experienced unprecedented freedom. No one had insulted him or told him he deserved to die. No one had hexed him or tried to hurt him. It had been... peaceful. Relaxing even. He missed it already. But September had unfortunately arrived. Tom had kindly sent one of his staff to escort Harry to Kings Cross. He had boarded in plenty of time and found an almost empty compartment occupied by a sleeping man he assumed was the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. And the first student to see him had greeted with a violently whispered "How can you show your face here after what you did, you murderer! I hope Sirius Black finds you and tortures you to death!" Charming. And then the Dementors had boarded the train. And Harry had passed out. And now Malfoy was doing dying swan impressions every time Harry glanced his way. Oh yes. It was so nice to be back at jolly old Hogwarts. Harry stiffened in shock as Professor McGonagal entered the Great Hall and placed a hat on a stool. No! It couldn't be! He glared at his floppy nemesis while the new first years filed into the Great Hall. He sullenly blanked his expression as it sang an inappropriately jaunty ditty about the importance of supporting each other in the face of tragedy. He was flooded with miserable resignation as "Ainslow, Cara" was summoned to have her doom declared to the masses. GRYFFINDOR! Lucky brat. "Arrow, Jason" GRYFFINDOR! Sigh. "Borden, Savannah" GRYFFINDOR! What? "Bridgeworth, Gareth" GRYFFINDOR The Hell? The other students began to stir restlessly as student after student was sorted into the same house. McGonagals voice was starting to shake with nerves. "Koriendar, Augustus" GRYFFINDOR! Faint murmurs of protest were starting to be heard. Snape, Sprout and Flitwick were looking angry, but trying to hide it. The Griffindors were all shuffling up along the benches in an attempt to make room for the unexpected influx. "Pennerick, Portia" GRYFFINDOR! Dumbledore was sitting in his chair, steadily growing paler, but doing his best to look unperturbed. "Turpin, Leila" GRIFFINDOR! The students from the other houses were starting to yell in outrage. The Gryffindors were packed so close together they were practically sitting on each other laps. "Veranis, Merrick" GRYFFINDOR! Harry rested his chin on his hands and tried to hide his grin. "Yorrick, Tiberius" GRYFFINDOR! The three house heads had given up trying to hide their anger and were yelling at Dumbledore, who was doing his best to calm them down. "Zebaccus, Antony" GRYFFINDOR! Absolute chaos! Every single new student had been sorted into Gryffindor. Harry buried his head in his hands and tried not to laugh too loudly. "I bet this is all Potters fault!" ... ... sigh. /!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\/!\ Authors Note - Just a little plot bunny that popped into my head and made a nest. I've often thought that, if firsties were really sorted by the criteria Ron (and most other Gryffindors) seem to think are used in the sorting, all of the students would be Gryffindors. They're only 11 after all. Miserable Harry was really just a device to get rid of the hat, but he got away from me and kind of took over the story. In fact I have his whole life story written down in my story notes, so if this gets enough interest there may be a sequel one day...
