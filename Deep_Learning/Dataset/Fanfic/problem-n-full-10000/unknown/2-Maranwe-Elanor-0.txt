Behind him and several feet away, Elrohir did the same, finally having abandoned his bow. Metal clashed, the vibration from the power of the strike traveling through his wrist and up his arm, but he could not pause and he could not let it bother him. He pushed back and met the next strike, backpedaling to keep his attackers before him as they moved in close, trying to get around him, the strikes coming fast and hard. Against his will, he was slowly being pushed back to the burned-out fire, into the midst of the newly awake men who were only just beginning to fully scramble to counter the attack. They grabbed whatever was at hand. He heard the banging of iron pots behind him and met the attack that came from before him. What had happened? Where did they come from? Who were they? He had no idea and could not help but wonder how men could be so different. How they could attack one another without reason or provocation and never give it a second thought. If it were not for the fact that all men were not like that, he would have been worried about the fate of Middle-earth. He swung his blade up quickly before him, then to the right, stepping to the side and spinning to miss the strike that came down where his head would have been from the person before him. Pulling the blade point down towards his right side, he countered the strike that came across to his side and ducked the blow aimed at his head. He continued the spin and danced backwards, avoiding two more strikes that came out of nowhere and deflecting another that would have sliced him from hip to hip. Behind him, he could hear his brother's struggles and knew himself to be edging backwards, the tide of enemies forcing him back, battering at him relentlessly, and he could not focus enough on one enemy long enough to finish them off. After the first few, none seemed to stray close enough, and yet they poked at him relentlessly. He frowned, then danced quickly backward, jumping over a bag on the ground. He was in the midst of the camp. A crash and familiar cry behind him spun him around. He saw his brother crash to the ground, saw him collapse under a tide of bodies. He took a step in Elrohir's direction, intending to cut the men who hurt him down, intending to leave the travelers to fight their own battles, intending to go to his flesh and blood. He intended . . . and yet managed none of it. The elf turned his attention away from the men who surrounded him, turned his back, and he made it only one step before something hard impacted with the back of his head, sending a sharp report through his skull and fuzing his vision, making it jump and blur around the edges. In the split second before he lost consciousness, he saw his brother lying on the floor, felt his knees go weak and begin to drop him, and saw the ground coming ever closer. He never felt himself hit the ground. *~*~*~*~* *~* *~*~*~*~* *~* *~*~*~*~* Review Responses: Elfmage: Um . . . Yes? I think that was a cliffie, in a way. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you loved it, and I hope you enjoy this one! Kathira: Aragorn torture I can do. It's Legolas torture I seem to have trouble with. *frowns then smiles brightly* I'm glad you liked. Truly, you have no idea. Deana: Well, not ealier than New Years, but it's not later than it either. *g* Hope you like this one, too. Aragornsthe1: Enquiring minds could find out, but then that would ruin any surprises, wouldn't it? *smiles serenely* I'll guess you'll just have to read and find out. That'll be horribly taxing, I know. *g* Thanks for reviewing! Nell Marie: I like the light-hearted endings, too. And the not-so-light-hearted epilogue definitely meant there was another story on the way. Lol. Subtle, aren't I? *smirks* Bill the Pony2: Ooh, I'm so glad! I have good news, there will be plenty of chapters for you to enjoy . . . Unless they're bad, then there'll be plenty for you to hate. Hmm. . . . I was glad to hear from you. I was debating whether or not to post on schedule or wait till I had finished, and it's because of your email that I decided to post, so . . . . *g* hehe. Grumpy: Ah ha, you took my request seriously, and I'm so horrified to say you were right: I had forgotten about the mountain pass. At the moment, I can't remember if I included anything about it or not. I think I did. *grimaces* It's been so long since I read that part. I know where it would be if it was there, so I'll have to check. The figure with the bloody hands will be identified . . . Eventually. *g* You just might have to be intuitive to get it. As for Legolas. . . . *shrugs* He should. Honestlly, I would. NaughtyNat: lol. Yes, you were both 50th and 100th reviewer. You can shoot for adding 25th and 75th to the dubious honor if you like. Hehe. Lol, I can so picture that, too! In fact, that gives me an idea. . . .I just don't know if it will work. Hmm. . . . I didn't say how those two found them because Raniean and Trelan won't tell me. *looks peeved* It's quite rude of them, actually, but they won't tell until the ell prince and ranger spill the beans, so we'll all have to wait. *g* Nasty works. Wait till the last handful of chapters. . . . I mean last handful I have currently written. It's not done yet. I'm getting hearitly tired of this thing. It won't stop .
