Archery Club." I replied. It's true; I had an eye for archery since I was born! I always wanted to join the Olympics and do archery; it was the only thing I am good at. Since I am dyslexic, I can't do many things, unless I try to conquer over the dyslexic part of me. Bella mastered that part a bit, but I have a feeling that I can't. As I was walking with Chiron, I looked over to my right to see a cabin. The top part of the cabin said something in Greek, but I understood it perfectly, it said "APOLLO". I never really knew any Greek words, heck, I don't even know any! But it seems I can understand it. "Is anything wrong Aaron?" Chiron asked. "No, I am just fine." I said; I didn't want him to worry about the whole Greek thing so I decided to keep it to myself. I just wonder, is that normal? I mean, I never really know much Greek, when I looked at the plaque of the cabin, it looked like perfect English! And due to my dyslexia, my reading skills are not that good. 000000000 Chiron showed me around for a bit and then I went back to the infirmary to check on Bella but, she wasn't there. I wonder where she went; she really shouldn't be leaving the infirmary without being healed fully. I walk out of the infirmary and headed over to the archery area, I don't know about you but, I really badly want to shoot an apple off of someone's head! Before starting, I waited for the other campers to leave. I pick up an arrow, making sure that no one sees me and I aim the arrow at the target then shoot, WHOOSH! The arrow soars through the air and BAM! It hits the target. "You're pretty good, you know that?" said a voice. I quickly jump back, turn around and hide the bow and arrow behind my back. Then I see a dude with some horns on his head and goat feet. Then I tried to explain. "I-I am s-sorry! I really didn't mean to try the archery area without asking! It looked so tempting to try! I just was tem-" "Its fine, you don't have to ask to train. But you should really have some armor on before you do something stupid and hurt yourself." Said the goat dude. I look down at my feet, then I notice his, he's a satyr. "The name's Grover, who are you?" Grover asked. "My name is Aaron, Aaron Holt. I'm the new camper, well, one of the new campers." I replied. "You know, you seem like Apollo's kid, you are good at archery, you seem like a cool dude, and you don't look to bad, you actually look like Apollo himself. But, not as handsome as me." Grover teased. "You really think that I could be the Son of Apollo?" I asked. It could be true, I mean, I'm good at archery, and I like poems, so it has to fit! "Well, I think so, but you have to be claimed in order to make it official. But, I'm sure you'll be claimed soon." Grover explained. So you have to be claimed? It's like claiming something you lost from the Lost and Found at school. Well then, that sounds interestingâ€¦ Ok I want this to be a SYOT. So PM me your demigod! REMEMBER: PM ME YOUR DEMIGOD!
