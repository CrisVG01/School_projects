again. "He's going to hate me." I told her. "I've killed people Mom. He's going to be so disappointed in me." "Oh baby, he's just going to be glad to finally have you home. We've missed you so much baby, so very much." She told me. "You need a bath. There is a room set up for you upstairs; we had it ready just in case. There are also some clothes. Go bathe and then get into some new clean clothes." So I did as my mother said, I took a bath and then quickly changed into the button down shirt, pants, suspenders, and shoes that I had found in my dresser and then made my way downstairs to Mom who wrapped me in her arms again, pulling me onto her lap in the couch. "I've been waiting far too long to hold you again darling, I refuse to put you down until your father arrives home." She smiled. I was okay with that. I just took in the always comforting scent of my mother and allowed her to hold me for another hour before I heard a car pull up and Dad's thoughts invaded my mind. He was thinking about how surely he was mistaken but he swore he could smell me. He quickly entered the home and paused as he saw me in Mom's arms. I looked away, I couldn't stand for him to see my eyes. "Edward." He choked out. I buried my head into my mother, to ashamed to look at my father. "He's afraid you'll be angry with him." Mom clarified. "My adorable little son" Dad told me as his fingers pulled my chin to look at him "how could I be angry with you when you've come home?" "I killed people." I choked out. "I know." He told me. "I did things you taught me not to." I told him. "I know." He agreed. "I ran away from home." I whimpered. "I know." He nodded. "I'm sorry." I sighed. "I know." He told me as he took me from Mom's arms and held me close to him. I felt my body relax as he held me. I had my Dad back. "I'm so sorry!" I sobbed tearless sobs. "It's alright son, you're forgiven." He promised me. "Punish me, please Dad!" I begged. The guilt was eating me alive; if he'd just punish me I'd feel better. I'd feel like I deserved his forgiveness. "I'm not going to punish you for this." He disagreed as he held me tighter. "Please Daddy; I need you to forgive me!" I cried. "You're already forgiven sweet child." He promised. "You don't understand, I need you to punish me so you can forgive me!" I sobbed. "Carlisle, maybeâ€¦" Mom trailed off "Is that what it's going to take for you to believe you are forgiven?" Dad asked. I nodded and he sighed. "Alright son, let's head up to my study then." Dad didn't even go through the normal lecturing, he simply pulled me over his knee, undid my suspenders, pulled my pants down, and began. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. The first ten smacks were hard and I found myself having to hold onto his legs, gripping fairly hard to help from crying out. I wouldn't cry, no, I had no right to. I had abandoned everything I had been taught, I had left home. I didn't have a right to cry. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. The next ten stung even more and the pace was increased. I wouldn't cry, I wasn't going to cry. I just clutched Dad's leg even harder. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. That was usually it. I usually got twenty five smacks and then it was done. Usually by now I was sobbing but I had yet to even whimper. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. The next five shocked me simply because it wasn't over yet and I gasped a tiny bit. "Edward, cry. That's how I know you've had enough, just let it loose son." I wouldn't cry, I had no right to. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. Thirty five later, I still had barely whimpered. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. I still stayed brave, that was forty. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. SMACK. That was officially twice what I usually got and I refused to cry. I wouldn't cry. "Edward, I am not going to continue." Carlisle told me as he allowed me to res across his knees, as he rubbed my back a bit. "Little one." I finally sobbed. Why was he being so kind to me? He must be disgusted with me. "I'm sorry!" I sobbed. "Buddy, you're alright." He told me. "I'm not angry with you." "I'm sorry!" I sobbed. "I'm so sorry!" Carlisle sighed as he pulled me up into his lap. I tried to fight his comfort, break his embrace, but he simply held my head to his chest, not allowing me to break the embrace. "I am not angry." "You're probably so ashamed of me." I sobbed. "No, never, I could never ever be ashamed of you." He promised me. "Don't think that, not even for a second. You are my son, nothing you could ever do would make me ashamed to call you my child." "I'm so sorry." I sobbed again. "I love you Edward, I love you so much." Dad told me as he rocked me a bit. "Nothing in this world could change how much I love you. You could slaughter an entire town and I would still love you just as much." "Really?" I asked hopefully "Really." He agreed. Maybe he did forgive me? Maybe even with my horrid behavior he still had it in him to love me. How did I possibly manage to find a perfect mother and father? I didn't deserve them, not in the slightest. "I love you too Dad." I finally said.
