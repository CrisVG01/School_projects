"I always have, but it always felt wrong." "Why would it feel wrong?" "Because you guys were my family. Esme was the only mom I ever knew. I felt dirty thinking about how handsome you were, when you belonged to her." "I don't belong to her anymore," he whispered, as he stared at her lip. She licked her own in response. His resolved snapped and he leaned in capturing her lips. Lighting ran through both of their veins as the kiss intensified. Before she knew it, Bella was pinned to the bed with the delicious weight of him on top of her. "Carlisle," she gasped as she pushed on his chest, "I've never..." "I know." He covered her mouth with his own as he thrust his cock into the soft cotton covering her warm body. She let out a loud moan at the contact. "We don't have to tonight, but I can still make you feel good," he breathed, as his hand ran down her body, reaching the small sleep shorts she wore. She nodded and his hand slipped below the waist band, feeling her slick heat covering his fingers. "Fuck, you are so wet baby. Is this for me?" "Yes, yes, only for you, Carlisle." He rubbed at her nub until she was arching off the bed. His lips traveling down her neck to the top of her tank top. He nudged the neckline down and his mouth closed upon her breast causing her to cry out. "That's it baby. Just feel." he encouraged, while his index finger dipped into her tight opening. "Oh, baby, you feel perfect." He continued rubbing her clit as he finger fucked her gently. Her body heated and tightened til she thought she would explode. She writhed beneath him as he brought her to the brink of ecstasy.. "CARLISLE!" She screamed as wave after wave of pleasure rocked her body. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As much as Carlisle enjoyed kissing Bella, and being knuckles deep inside her, he was also enamored with simply holding her hand. The town may have been looking at them with judgemental eyes, but he was proud to have her on his arm. Dating Bella made him feel young again. The love and friendship they already had to each other evolved and grew to include lust and passion. And they were both about to explode from it. Carlisle wanted to go slow to make sure Bella was ready, and boy was she ever. Their night-time activities had progressed from fingers and frottage to lips and tongues in hidden places. Soon night time turned to day time, and the horney couple couldn't keep their hands off of each other. It was the day before Thanksgiving, and Bella was baking a pie. Alice was due home the next day, and they hadn't decided what to tell her. Carlisle wrapped his arms around her from behind. "We could just try to act normal, and maybe she won't think anything is going on?" "Not likely," he said as he thrust his cock into her from behind. He was very distracting. "We could always tell her we're fucking." She said coyly. "But that would be dishonest," he said with a kiss on her neck. Bell turned in his arms, her lips centimeters from his, "It doesn't have to be a lie..." Suddenly she was whisked up into his arms as he swiftly carried her to his bedroom. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Carlisle laid her gently on the bed, and just stared at her for a few moments. He was far from being a virgin, but he was nervous. This woman was his life. Bella rose to her knees and tugged his shirt up. Taking the hint he removed it, and reached out for hers. As he exposed her skin to his hungry eyes, he leaned forward and kissed the tops of her beautiful breasts. Unhooking her bra, he fondled the full and supple skin. Her breasts were beautiful, much like the rest of her. She reached out and undid his pants. He removed them as well as his underwear, standing before her in all his glory. She stood from the bed and removed her own pants and panties. For the first time they were fully exposed to each other. Carlisle gently ran his hand down her stomach. "Lay back, baby" Bella complied slowly, in a dreamlike state. His hands ran over the length of her body as he climbed on the bed. She widened her legs to make room for him. As his fingers reached her apex, he slid down so his mouth could join them. He tongued her till her hips were thrusting off the bed, bucking her clit into his mouth. He loved her with his mouth til she was gasping his name, coming all over his face. He crawled up her body, kissing his way back up to her lips, where he kissed her fiercely. "We'll tell her we are in love. I'll tell her you are my life. You are my future. You are my everything," he said and then kissed her again, as the head of his cock rubbed against her swollen nub. "Carlisle, please," she begged. He reached for the bedside drawer, but she stilled his hand. "Just you. I want to feel all of you." Carlisle nodded his acquiescence, and slowly slid into her tight warmth. Luckily, all their previous activities had taken care of her barrier, and she was ready for him. She moaned in pleasure as he bottomed out inside of her. His strokes started slow and loving until she made it known she needed more. Thrusting her hips up and wrapping her legs around him, he got the signal...she needed it harder. She needed it faster. She just needed. Carlisle thrust into her with an intensity he'd never felt before. They were so lost in their pleasure, they didn't hear the door slam downstairs. Didn't hear the footsteps outside the door, or the knock before the door opened. "Daddy, I'm Home!...Daddy?"
