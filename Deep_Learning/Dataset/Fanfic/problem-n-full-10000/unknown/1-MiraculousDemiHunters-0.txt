at the 15 year old and mumbled, "I'm 14," under her breath loud enough for him to hear. She knew he was joking, but she was still annoyed. The boy burst out laughing. "Right. Well, I'm Zane, by the way." He stuck out his hand. "Zane?" Aubrey shook it. "That sounds normal for a Seam name. No offence. Like I have room to talk about the Seam like that." Zane gave her an odd look. "My great grandfather was a Merchant back before and during the dark days. We lost all of our money and had to move to the Seam." Aubrey laughed. "Well, lucky you. I keep wondering how I'm not in the Seam yet." This time, Zane said something. "W . . . What? But you're from Town, you're that girl who owns that shoe shop. Why would you . . ." he paused for a second. "Is it because of the rumors?" "You mean you don't believe them?" she raised an eyebrow. The boy gave her a look. "No. Should I?" She eyed him for a moment. "No," she said, kind of hesitant. "But people usually believe everything the Merchant girls say." "Well, it sounds so stupid. I would just accept it and move to the Seam. So, why wouldn't you?" Aubrey tilted her head. "Plus, you kinda look like you're not all the way straight. And they never said anything about girls so . . ." "You know, I'm starting to like you." "Really?" he wagged his eyebrows. She glared at him. "Not like that, you idiot." Zane laughed, and Aubrey grudgingly admitted that she was really intrigued by him. "So, you got a last name or . . .?" she trailed off. "I do, but I prefer not to share it with random strangers that I meet in the woods." She held up her hands. "Touch√©." Zane looked at her curiously. "You know, you never told me why you were here." Aubrey sucked in a deep breath. "Er . . . I prefer not to tell it to random strangers that I meet in the woods?" she said sheepishly. "Ha, ha." Zane took her hand and made her sit next to him. "Now, what's the real reason? I have a guess, but I'd rather let you tell." "Well," she started timidly. "There are these awful bullies in school. You know, those older Merchants? The rich ones? Yeah, them. Today wasn't a good day. Their teasing got a little harsh. So I left. And I ended up here. And . . . yeah." Zane nodded his head. "I figured as much." "But you still asked?" He rolled his eyes and shook his head. "I wanted you to tell me, you idiot." Aubrey scowled. "Um, I am not the idiot. You're the idiot." "My idiot senses say otherwise." She snorted. "It must be malfunctioning from so much idiot coming from you." Zane glared at her. "Oh, ha, ha." Aubrey smiled for a bit and then realized something. "Hey, you never told me why you were in the woods and not at school." He snorted. "I hunt. Duh." Aubrey rolled her eyes. "I didn't expect you to answer so honestly. What if I was here to kill you?" "I think you just made it clear you aren't. And you've already seen me here. What else would I be doing?" "Taking a leak?" she suggested. Zane laughed. "I can assure you that is not why I'm here, my toilet works just fine. As to why I wasn't at school, well, hunting never waits. And we had a test today that I didn't study for, and my mother thought I was only skipping school to hunt, so how could I pass up the opportunity?" Aubrey shook her head. "You are just something else." "So I've been told." Aubrey sighed and lied her head on his shoulder. Yeah, yeah, stranger danger and all, but she felt like she could trust him for some reason. After a few minutes, she looked up to see the sky darkening considerably. "Well, I better go before anyone realizes I'm gone. School is way over by now, and my mom might notice that the floor is still dirty." Zane raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. "Ditto. I need to get my stuff and go home before anything comes after me." Aubrey leaped up and stretched. She looked down and noticed Zane was still there. "Well? Go get your stuff and meet me back here." He jumped up and saluted. "Yes ma'am." Aubrey hummed for a bit while she waited, then abruptly stopped when she realized what she was doing. Then she started again because why not? Zane came back a few minutes later, sporting a hunting bag and some rope. "Okay, let's go." They walked towards the fence, exchanging playful insults along the way. "If I'm the princess of idiots, then you must be the king." "Wouldn't that make me your dad?" She thought about it for a second then shuddered. "Ugh . . . just the thought of being related to you is sickening." "I'm honored to have such high regards from you." When they finally reached the fence, Aubrey felt herself feeling kind of sad. This stranger had made her feel more happy than she had felt in a long time. "Well, I guess it's time to say goodbye," Zane said, biting his lip. Aubrey laughed kind of sadly. "Yeah. But I'm sure you'll see me again. Maybe I'd even meet you here tomorrow." she slid in a tiny suggestion. Zane smiled at her. "I'd like that. I want to get to know you more. You seem . . . well, interesting. I like interesting people." Aubrey smiled at him, then made a split second decision. She threw her arms around his chest and hugged him for a second. "See you tomorrow," she whispered against his chest. She turned around and walked away, sneaking one glance at him and his shining grey eyes.
