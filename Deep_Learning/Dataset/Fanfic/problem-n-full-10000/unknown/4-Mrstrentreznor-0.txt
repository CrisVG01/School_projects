and it wasn't hard-" "No. You have to leave." There is a knock at the door. "Bells? You okay? I can hear voices." "Dad?" "Dad?" says the bar guy. "Oh, fuck." He flips off her but still lays on the bed next to her. She pulls the sheets up to her chin. The door lock clicks, slowly opens and Charlie stands in the doorway with his firearm lowered. "See! Shoot you," Bella hisses. "Seth?" Charlie asks. "You're back early." "Yeah. Look what I found in my bed." "Oh…I should introduce you, Seth, Bella, Bella Seth," Charlie says waving between them with his gun. "Jeez, Dad, point that thing somewhere else." "The safety's on." "Seth?" Bella screeches. "Your bed? B-but y-you're twelve." "What the fuck is g- oh, hey, Seth," Leah says as she peers around Charlie. Bella looks totally confused. "Guys, can I just have ten minutes?" Seth asks. "We'll be out to explain in a minute." "Sure." Charlie frowns at Bella but goes. "Five minutes," he mutters as if he knows something is wrong but can't work out what it is. Seth stands and closes the door and leans his back against it. She looks at him in disbelief. He has no shirt on. It isn't fair. "Y-you-" She has nothing. "I thought I would never see you again." "How old are you?" she ignores his statement. "And here you are… after I let you go... just waiting in my bed as if the tribal gods had placed you here for me." "How old? Leah said you were her little brother." He is silent. "I met you in a bar," she argues. "A bar that I am only just able to be in legally." "Don't I look twenty one?" "You look twenty five but answer the question." "Sixteen. I never get carded." He shrugs eloquently. Of course he doesn't. Dear God. Look at him. "Oh, my God. I have broken every law in the country." "Not quite, our parents aren't married yet." "Oh, my God. I'm the worst kind of cradle snatcher." "Might be - but we are still not related." She isn't listening. "A five year gap. Five years." "Hey now," he approaches her carefully. "Stop panicking." "You're a child." He looks irritated by the accusation. "I am not a child. I showed you that." Had he ever. "It doesn't matter. You are in calendar years." She waves a hand frantically. "My father will kill me." "He won't. He likes me." "Not when he finds out that we …" "Fucked." She stares at him. "What are we going to do?" "Did you miss me?" "What?" She tries to clamber out of bed, find her clothes and hold the sheet over herself. "Did you?" "Yes." It is a confession. She sits down with a thump. "I kept thinking about you. I kept having flashbacks." He kneels in front of her. "Me, too." She has to touch him. She strokes a fingertip down his cheek. He leans into her hand. "I'm not losing you again," he says. His hands are behind her calves. He looks earnest. "What do you want to do?" She shakes her head. "I don't know…" "Talk to me. We are good at that." "I…" She huffs out a breath. "Okay…" She tries to think it all out. He waits for her to speak, his hands rubbing gently at the back of her knees. "That tickles." "So come down here." Sit on his lap? "Oh, no. That would be way too distracting. And this close to the bed? Uh-uh. No way." "So you feel it, then." "Feel it? I don't know what you mean… but I need to touch you. I don't want you to be upset or hurt and I don't know why that is. All we did was fuck." "We did more than that." "Okay… we fucked lots of times." "We connected." "Even without names." "Have you finished running?" he looks as if her answer will matter. "I don't want to run from you," she confesses. "So we will work it out." "I'm seriously weirded out by the age difference." "I know. It won't matter as much, when we get older." "How do you know what I feel all the time?" "There's something… a thing that I thought was a burden and a removal of choice - a thing that made me run as well and then let you go without a name or any way to contact you." "I don't understand." "But in this case, it's a solution." He lays his head in her lap and wraps his arms around her hips. She feels so much better when he touches her. As if it will all work out somehow. She brushes over his long hair; tucking the ends in, before her hands slide down his muscled back and holds him there. They breathe quietly together. "Charlie's coming. You need to get dressed." "How can you hear him?" "That's another thing I need to tell you. I will explain, I promise." He stands and finds her clothes for her. He helps her get dressed. Charlie knocks. "Just a second," Bella says. Seth uses both hands to push her hair off her face. "We can do this." "Seth?" "Yeah?" "Nothing. I am just trying it out." He smiles at her and when Charlie opens the door they are kissing. That is when the shouting starts, but Seth holds fast to Bella's hand the whole time. Sue wakes up, and then she makes them all sit at the kitchen table before she clears her throat and starts to explain a few things. Seth is still holding Bella's hand and she looks at him with new eyes. Bella and Charlie both learn a lot more about the Quileute that morning. Seth smiles at her and now she knows where that confidence comes from. She can be utterly certain of him. He will never cheat on her with her best friend. She will never need to run away again.
