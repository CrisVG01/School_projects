very long time my wolf and I both started to feel relaxed when I held her in my arms; I could feel my heart wanting to burst out of my chest when she laid her head against it, I almost felt bad when I gently nudged her towards the stage. I watched as she made her way towards the stage but when she got about half way there a strange man grabbed her arm and he tried to pull her to him, I could feel how scared my mate was so I rushed as fast as I could to them ready to tear the guy apart. (Akiko's P.O.V) As I made my way towards the stage I felt someone grab my arm and jerk me around, once I saw that it was Michael I started to panic "What the hell do you want Michael, I told you years ago that I never wanted to see you ever again" "Shut up bitch, do you think you can really get away from me? I own you and your mother" he growled, I felt tears begin to fall from my eyes as his figures started to grip my arm tighter and I knew there would be marks. "Is there a problem here Akiko" I almost jumped for joy when I heard Sam's voice from behind me "This is between us, mind your own business if you know what's good for you" Michael said as he tried to pull me closer to him, Sam grabbed his wrist that was attached to my arm and he began squeezing it which caused Michael to cry out in pain and he released me "I'll only say this once, leave Akiko alone or the next time I'll make sure to remove your arms" Michael nodded and Sam pushed him away, as Michael walked away he called out from over his shoulder "You'll both pay dearly for this" he said as he disappeared in the crowed. I turned to Sam and I smiled when I saw him looking down at me with concern written all over his face, I heard him growl as he lifted the arm that Michael held and I gasped when I saw the dark bruise "Sam it's ok he didn't hurt me, look at me" I laid my hands on both of his cheeks and I lifted his face up so he could look me in the eyes, once his eyes locked on with mine I kissed him quickly on the lips "Thank you for coming to my rescue Sam, I have no clue how he found me " before he could replay we both heard James yelling for me to get back on stage, I was about to walk away when I felt Sam's arm wrap around my waist and he escorted me to the stage. "Thank you ladies and gentleman I'm going to take you back in time with this song but I want to dedicated this to someone in the audience tonight, he hurt me a few years ago and tonight I would like to sing a song in his honor" I went to an old karaoke machine and I turned on a disco beat: At first I was afraid I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live Without you by my side But then I spent so many nights Thinking how you did me wrong And I grew strong And I learned how to get along And so you're back From outer space I just walked in to find you here With that sad look upon your face I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key If I had known for just one second You'd be back to bother me Go on now go walk out the door Just turn around now 'Cause you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye Did you think I'd crumble Did you think I'd lay down and die Oh no, not I I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give And I'll survive I will survive (hey-hey) It took all the strength I had Not to fall apart Kept trying hard to mend The pieces of my broken heart And I spent oh so many nights Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry But now I hold my head up high And you see me Somebody new I'm not that chained up little person Still in love with you And so you felt like dropping in And just expect me to be free And now I'm saving all my loving For someone who's loving me Go on now go walk out the door Just turn around now 'Cause you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye Did you think I'd crumble Did you think I'd lay down and die Oh no, not I I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give And I'll survive I will survive [x2] (I will Survive- Gloria Gaynor) When I finished the audience started erupting with whistles and applauds; I looked down and saw that Sam was still standing exactly where he was before looking at me smiling so instead of walking off stage like I did before, I decided to jump off the stage and right into his arms.
