my gaze from my mom's back, I turned to the imposing man standing before me. As stated before he was rather tall, with longish black hair that fell in a curtain around is sallow face. He had sharp, dark brown eyes and an intimidating aura./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Hello Miss Colyns. My name is Severus Snape, I was a friend of your mother's while attending Hogwarts. She has asked me to help guide you during the rest of your schooling. As I am the Potions Professor, this will not be an issue. If you will follow me, I will introduce you to someone I believe you will get along with," he explained in a deep baritone. He turned away with a snap of his cape (I know it's a robe, but come on...). I had no choice but to follow. We entered the train and walked to the back of the train. As Professor Snape (apparently I couldn't say Mister as I was in Europe) lead on, he explained the housing system at Hogwarts and told me that he was Head of House Slytherin. I simply hummed whenever a rhetorical question was asked, only slightly paying attention./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" This was proven when I ran into Professor Snape's back when he stopped in front of a room. Rubbing my head and slightly pouting, I side-stepped the man waiting to be introduced. However, after giving me a vague look of amusement and exasperation, Professor Snape left with another snapping of his robes. I balked, then pouted again, suddenly shy. I knew I had to introduce myself, but I was still slightly self-conscious./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Hello. I see Uncle Severus deemed you worthy of his attention. Congratulations," said a platinum blond haired man. That's what he was too. A man. He looked strong, confident, patient, and yet still had an air of cunning and mischievousness./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Thanks...?" I really didn't know how to answer./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "My name is Draco Malfoy. These are my friends, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle, and Vincent Crabbe. We are all in Slytherin, yourself?" Draco said all this with in a slightly mocking way that peeved me./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Althea Colyns. I haven't been sorted yet," I replied quietly. Draco sneered at me. I raised an eyebrow, unamused./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Why did my Godfather bring you here if you're so unimportant? Not to mention a first year. Get lost, squirt." If there was one thing I couldn't stand, it was when people judged me based on my height. I snapped back at him./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "According to the letter I received, I'm a sixth year. Which makes sense considering I'm sixteen, Mr. Malfoy," I growled. I hated people like him. Arrogant. Selfish. He stared at me./span/div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "Unless you transferred from another school, that's not possible. I know you aren't a transfer. My father is a school governor you see," he continued with pride. "So, you are lying." Having enough with his attitude, I all but shoved my letter into his preppy face and sat down close to the door. You know, just in case. I watched Draco's face as he read./span/div p class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /p div class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" "I technically did transfer. I never said it was from a wizarding school. I'm from Canada. They don't have magic schools there. We just recently moved here and that's when I received the letter. And before you say anything you might regret, no, I am not a muggleborn, nor am I a half-blood. Both my parents' families were wizards. I'm apparently a pureblood." I knew that I couldn't reveal the whole truth, but nobody said I couldn't explain a little about my background. I was just glad that both Mom and Professor Snape had warned me about people who were obsessed with blood purity./span/div div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1486831330175_5514" class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial; min-height: 14px;" /div div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1486831330175_5511" class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px; margin: 0px; line-height: normal; font-family: Arial;"span id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1486831330175_5513" class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;"strong id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1486831330175_5512" class="yiv2523172830" style="-webkit-padding-start: 0px;" So that's it for the first chapter. Short, I know, but what did you guys think? Was it good, bad, need editing? Don't be too hard on me now, I haven't written anything in quite a few years you know. Anyways, I should be posting a new chapter for my other three stories soon, so ya. Probably not today though, I work in a few hours and won't be back home until around 9:30pm. I'll most likely go right to bed. I love you guys! -Ashebr /strong/span/div /div /div /div /div /div
