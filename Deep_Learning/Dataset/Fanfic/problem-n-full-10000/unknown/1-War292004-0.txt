said Caesar. "Is uh… this what you had in mind?" "Heh… well… can't say that it was, Caesar…" said Yosuke. "But there's not much I can do about it now other than work the hardest I've ever worked at anything. With my partners here, I don't think we'll have a problem coming in first place… after all, it's not our first rodeo, right guys?" "Well, a lot of our lower-performing Districts seem to have optimists in their ranks tonight, so that's one more refreshing twist on this year's Hunger Games," said Caesar. "Finally, Mr. Narukami… as the last interview of the night, you get the closing arguments… so… what should we expect from District 12?" "You should expect four friends who have conquered their dark sides to bring forth all their innate power… and crush the competition," said Yu, in a very even voice. "A common sentiment repeated right out to the very end… friendships will certainly be tested tomorrow!" Caesar exclaimed. "Well, folks, it's time for our last District to receive their scores. Delta, we call upon you one more time..." "Yosuke Hanamura… your score is 3 points," said Delta. "Wh-what? Just three? That's… impossible, you saw me… er… I guess I can't say…" Yosuke said, catching himself. "Rise Kujikawa… your score is 6 points," said Delta. "Eh… for a Beauty, I'll take it. Don't they average like… 5 points usually anyway?" said Rise, with a shrug. "Yu Narukami… your score is 11 points," said Delta. "Wow. Really?" was all Yu said, his eyes wide with shock. "Naoto Shriogane… your score is 6 points," said Delta. "As is to be expected," said Naoto. "Thank you." "Thank you, District 12, you may return to your seats," said Caesar. Once they were back, he stood and addressed the group at large again. "Well, folks, there you have it! This will conclude the Parade and Interviews! The Hunger Games starts tomorrow; don't forget to make your last-minute preparations tonight. Let's have one more enthusiastic round of applause for all 48 of our tributes!" The stadium blasted out one more ear-shattering round of applause, whistles, cheers and chants. Once everything died down, people filed out of the stadium. You glanced back once more just before you left, as the many tributes also turned to head out to their training center and accommodations for their last-minute fine-tuning before the festivities began. You could feel the excitement building inside of you as you imagined which match ups would be the most entertaining, as well as which parties you might attend after you got outside, not to mention when and where you were going to watch the show itself. At least you only had one more night to wait before the 2012 Hunger Games began. Author Note: Woah. That got out of control fast. 15.5K words later, here's the first part of the full Hunger Games Galaxies, which finally brings all the Tributes together. Yes, like everything else, the scores for each Tribute were decided by a roll of the dice. And this time, unlike the Games itself (which is mostly completed at the writing of this chapter), I did these live as I was writing the dialog. Thank you for reading, and may the odds be ever in your favorite characters' favor!
