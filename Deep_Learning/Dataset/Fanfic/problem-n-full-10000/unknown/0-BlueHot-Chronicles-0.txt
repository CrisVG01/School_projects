telling the truth and she's right. Lily was about to kill me in that clearing, it's why I sent Harry here, to keep him safe from her as she'd said she was going to get rid of him. No one, not even Lily had she lived, would think to look for him here. I have no idea how she was killed; a delayed spell or potion might be the answer. I just don't know." "And you will never know. Are you taking him to his family now?" Mrs Diya asked speaking for the first time; she didn't want her family in trouble with the Powers That Be, and she didn't want her daughter's heart to be broken anymore. "His paternal grandparents died a year ago and his maternal parents were mentally damaged because of Lily. Her sister, I believe now, was damaged the most." "He's right Priya, you've seen Henry and Heather when Petunia brings them for a visit; they're different," Mr Diya said. "Yes, Darius," Mrs Diya paused and glared at Severus, "but, I know what you're thinking and the Petunia Evans we know would never harm a hair on Harry's head." A throat cleared and all eyes turned to Xhara. "Actually, mum, dad, I found this on my bed this morning. I was waiting for the right time to give it to you; guess that's now." She brandished two letters, one addressed to herself and one to her parents. While Priya and Darius read the letters, Xhara turned to Severus. "Petunia wants my parents to keep Harry until she... heals," she said and she bit her lower lip before she continued, "Petunia knew Lily was going to die, Severus, and she knew there was a chance that Harry would be put in her care." "She's afraid of what she might do, isn't she?" Xhara nodded, but Severus' gaze was inward. Lily had caused so much damage to everyone around her. The Evans' were mentally compromised, Petunia had probably been cursed often long before he ever met them, and now this family had an extra mouth to feed that they hadn't been expecting. Not to mention the fact that they no longer had anything to do with the wizarding world since Xhara had to abandon her Hogwarts education in her fourth year. "I am sworn to protect Harry Potter, Mr and Mrs Diya, and I promise that you will want for nothing as long as you keep him safe." "We're well off enough to keep him, Mr Snape," Mr Diya said softly at his wife's gentle nod. "I know, but you will need the extra finances once you move to a safer location." "Why, would we need to move?" "Voldemort isn't fully gone from this world." Severus rolled up his sleeve, they all looked at his unmarked arm in confusion, until, with a closer look, they saw the faint outline of the Dark Mark. "We all now have a part to play in this boy's protection and unfortunately, my role will take me far from here and for a long time." ~~~(*)~~~(*)~~~ The next day, Severus gave the Diyas a packed duffle bag and by the end of the week their home on Miller's Row, Cokeworth was empty. Twice a week, Severus would visit the Diyas in their new home to ensure Harry's good health. The child was obviously happy with his new family and seemed to enjoy Severus' visits. It was on one of these days, just two weeks since his first visit, that Severus entered the Diyas new home to find the dead bodies of Priya and Darius. Harry Potter and Xhara Diya was nowhere to be found. ~~~(*)~~~(*)~~~ "I had asked you a question a long time ago; I'd requested that you not answer until you were sure of the correct response. You answered anyway." Solemn grey eyes met dark tortured orbs. "Yes, I'd heard your reply, young one; you always were an impatient one." Severus pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, "The Diyas, Harry... Xhara; they didn't deserve the kind of life they were forced into. They deserved better; I should have been there to protect them." There was silence for a few minutes as the energies of Master and Student pulsed around the room before dissipating. "You've unlocked the final stages of training." "I know." "And what will you do with such power Mr Strange?" "I want enough power in my hands to tear planets from the heavens…" his voice broke, and tears gathered in his eyes, " and place them in a new sky." ~~~(*)~~~(*)~~~ Dear Aurora, I know it's been years since we last spoke and I apologise for my negligence, but I must ask a personal favour and I hope you decide to at least hear me out. A mutual friend of ours is in dire need and I request your intelligence of the happenings of our world. If you agree to meet with me, please reply immediately. This note is set to self-destruct upon your releasing it. Signed… ~~~(*)~~~(*)~~~ Aurora frowned at the signature and muttered to herself. "Who the hell is Stephen Strange?"
