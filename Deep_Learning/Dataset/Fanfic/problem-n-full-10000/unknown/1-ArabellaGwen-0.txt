shrill crescendo of pain assaults his ears and he can't. He just can't. But then - Silence. All that remains is the violent thump of his heart and the gasping of his heaving chest. (Katniss?) (Is it over for today?) (Katniss?) A deep voice booms out from the box. "Prisoner unable to withstand questioning." A pause. "Everdeen is dead." And as the waning tide pulls him swiftly towards an unnavigable shore, Peeta Mellark dies too. He didn't come back soon. He didn't. He won't. Gale. The news comes through at midnight. Rory knocks at our door and collapses into my arms. He chokes out the story and something snaps within me. Peeta comforts the boy as I explode with rage. They both have to physically restrain me from storming right up to Command to attack Coin myself. It crashes over me. Gale. And I'm done. I'm out. Snow took Peeta from me. Coin took Gale from me. Neither of them has my loyalty anymore. I'm out of this war. This is no longer my fight. I am no longer their Mockingjay. I will be nobody's plaything, a piece in nobody's game. Gale didn't see it, but we were all just tributes in the 76th Games. Not anymore. I have Peeta. He has me. And we're done with the Games. Katniss. No. Scream. Stop. Katniss. Your hands. Katniss. Your hands, Mr Mellark. I don't know. Stop. Stain resistant. Count. No. Katniss. No. Katniss. No. Stop. Black. Katniss. Stop. Your hands. Stop. Black. Smoke. Smoke? No. Black. Choking. Smoke? Gas. Door. Light. Always. Keys. Katniss. No. Gas. Door. Light. Guard? No. G? G. Gale. Gale? Katniss? No. Katniss. No. No. No. No. Your hands, Mr Mellark. Gale. No. Gas. Katniss. Black. A lifetime ago, a handsome man told a young girl that if she saw something sweet, she'd better grab it quick. These words echo through my mind as I watch Finnick across the dining hall, his face about to split in two from the beaming smile that has spread across it. Annie sits beside him, their hands entwined as always. Together. Grab it quick. And don't let go. Words to live by. Peeta sits beside me, his hands moving animatedly as he tells a story about his eldest brother to a giggling Prim. My eyes linger on his profile and I have to sit on my hands to stop them from running through his blonde curls. He turns mid-sentence and smiles at me, the special smile he reserves only for me. My heart leaps and my eyes quickly duck down to my tray. I stare down at the remaining piece of food on my plate and an idea slowly comes to me. Something sweet. I look up at Peeta. Grab it quick. Down at the plate. A smile slowly works its way across my face as I sneak the food to my pocket in what I hope is a subtle manner. We finish our dinner and walk towards the exit doors. My heart begins to pound within my chest. This shift's dining hall guards are notoriously good at picking out hidden food. But we walk through the doorway unhindered and I let out a sigh of relief. Peeta looks at me quizzically but I just shake my head and he takes my hand as we walk briskly past the hallway that leads to Command. I still haven't yet told Coin that I'm done with her war. I haven't seen her since the news about Gale. Gale. Thinking about him still wrenches my heart, leaving me doubled over in physical pain. Peeta will hold me and rub my back and press soft kisses down my neck until it passes. Then we sit together and he makes me talk about him. About Gale. About the times we shared, what I loved about him, all the memories good and bad. We do the same for his family. For Madge. For Rue and Mags and Wiress. For all those we have lost. We weep and laugh and remember them as they would want to be. We promise to live well to make their deaths count. As Peeta and I see it, we've already won our war. We've been torn apart so many times, but now we grow back together. During the day, we explore the halls of 13. During the night, we explore each other. We have no idea what the future holds. But whatever may come, we will go into it as we do everything else â€“ together. Live or die, we will be together. And that's enough for us. It's hours later as we get ready for bed that I remember the contraband in my pocket. I pull it out and turn the small loaf of bread over in my fingers. I smile. "Peeta? Do you think we could make a fire?" The walls are grey. Paint. But no stains. Why no stains? People walk by, rush around, they talk, they poke, they stick needles, shine lights, shake their heads. Where? Who? Why? Doesn't matter. (Katniss.) No pain, no tears. Numb, dead. Thirteen? Doesn't exist. Doesn't matter. Haymitch? (Katniss.) Concern on his face, relief on his face, guilt on his face. Words flying by, but they don't matter. " Rescue." Too late. Why bother? Already dead. (Katniss.) (Katniss.) (Katniss.) Door. Haymitch keeps glancing towards it. Who's coming? What's coming? Doesn't matter. Look around. Table with a tray. Tray full of needles. Needle full of air and finish the job. Haymitch is saying words again. Pointing to the door. It opens and- (Katniss.) Not real. Not real, not real, not real. Dead, dead, dead. Your hands, Mr Mellark. (Katniss?) Heart stops beating, head stops thinking, eyes stop seeing. Can't trust them. Lies. Not real. Dead. (Katniss?) But she looks so real. (Real?) Crying and smiling and running towards. Real? Katniss? Real? Doesn't matter. Arms reach out. Thanks to my beta, for-prim.
