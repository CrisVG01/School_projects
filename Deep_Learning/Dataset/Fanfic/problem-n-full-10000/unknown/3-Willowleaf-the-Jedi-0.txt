Leo teased. "I've thrown a taco at you twice before, and I'm not afraid to do it again." I mumbled. "I can burn you." "I can shadow-travel you into the Underworld." "… I cannot burn." I face-palmed. "That definitely deserves an award." Leo smirked. "See? I can bring out the jokes in you." "Why are you not afraid of me? I can summon skeletons and choke you in darkness; and my sword-" "Would I be scared of someone I share tacos with?" I growled and bit into my taco. "Touché." "Ha!" In my mind, I gave him the finger. "So, what's with you and aggressively eating tacos?" Leo asked. "It's addicting." Was all I said. Leo raised an eyebrow and stared at his food. "It is?" "Very," I nodded solemnly. "You should try it." The Latino shrugged before trying to take an aggressive bite. I laughed before I could stop myself. Leo's eyes widened. "Oh my gods. You laughed!" "You should have seen yourself. That was golden." I said awkwardly, taking a bite of my taco. "Then should I do it like this?" he tried taking another aggressive bite. By the end of the night, I was practically howling with laughter. The next night went somewhat similar than the last. Leo was already sitting on the table, eating a taco, smiling. "Hey, taco thief. Wasn't expecting you." "Yeah, right." I casually hopped onto the table beside him. Only the taco platter was in-between us. "Did you know that twenty one pilots wrote a song about tacos?" Leo asked eagerly. "It could be our theme song." He began humming. "Twenty one pilots? Who are they?" Leo's jaw dropped. "How can you not-" he stopped himself. "Right. Different times." I nodded quickly, hoping that he'd get that I didn't want to touch on the subject. Leo reached into his tool belt and pulled something out – something I could only assume was an iPod. "Uh… is that an… iPod?" Leo nodded absent-mindedly. "Yeah. I'll show you the song." "But doesn't technology, like, make it easier for monsters to sense us?" I questioned. The last thing I'd want was for a legion of monsters to attack the ship. What if they'd steal our tacos? Leo raised his eyebrows, still looking at the screen. "Monster proof." Was all he said. I shrugged it off. Leo was a son of Hephaestus. He knew how to work technology. Said Latino handed me the iPod with a grin, and I was met with a weird – and I mean, really weird – song. I mean, what was this? Nobody makes six minute long songs. Right? Leo must have seen the odd look on my face when the song finished, because he smirked. "So, you like it?" "Your taste in music scares me." He smirked. "So, little Nico the Angel is scared? Of moi ?" I crossed my arms. "Why did I even come down here?" I said in exasperation. "Why, you missed me of course!" Leo cried. I shoved him. "Can we just eat our tacos in peace?" Seriously, I was starving. "Wanna have a contest to see who can eat their taco more aggressively? Will that get you to shut up and eat a taco?" Leo shoved me playfully. "You're gonna win. So… no." I smirked. "Ah, so you're accepting your defeat? Of course, it was meant to happen sooner or later." Leo clucked his tongue. "Oh I'm gonna get you for that." "Are you?" I taunted. Leo broke off a piece of his taco's shell and threw it at my face. It bounced harmlessly off my nose. "Oh, you're scaring me." I deadpanned. Leo scowled and bit into his food. I had to restrain myself from jumping up when I said: "Dude, you got it! You got the aggressive biting!" "I did?" Leo's eyes were wide. "You just did it!" Leo pumped his fists – forgetting he was holding a taco. I got salsa and other taco toppings all over me. "Leo!" I whined. Leo blushed. "Sorry, di Angelo." I threw my taco at his face. Leo threw his at mine. I blinked at him incredulously. He smirked, but the look in his eyes told me he was on edge. We both grabbed for a taco. And we threw. Food fights in the middle of the night were a lot of fun. In the mess hall the next morning, Leo and I looked the sleepiest. "Nico!" Hazel had rushed over and was cooing over me like a mother-hen. "What were you doing last night?" Jason smirked and folded his arms as if he knew something. "Yeah. Leo, you look sleepy too. Last I remember, you guys weren't on guard duty last night…" All eyes were on us. Hazel was fanning her face. I gulped and looked at Leo. He looked like a deer caught in the headlights. Piper was the first to break the silence. "Man, Percy and Annabeth will freak when they find out you two are dating!" The matching horrendous looks on our faces was enough to break the silence. Everyone laughed. Jason held his hands up. "Don't worry. We won't tell Hedge." "Oh – gods – guys, that isn't what we were doing-" Leo spluttered. "Yeah, we – were – just – eating tacos!" I added, face flushed. Jason smirked. "Yeah right." Oh gods. Why did I ever start midnight snacking? Yay? Did you like it? Was it good enough? On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate it? Tell me in reviews! And... question time! Do any of you guys like Bakugan? Because, I dunno, I wanna start a 'Bring back Lync Volan and give him to Alice' club. His ending was so unfair~! (oh, and yes. I ship Lync and Alice. But I also ship Shun and Alice. But I also ship Shun with myself...) Yeah, well, you don't need to hear me rant about Bakugan. I save that for my friends. Well, peace! Thanks for reading!
