into work." he says looking down at the ground. She closes the door behind her, "Oh." "Yeah, so I just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick, in person, you know?" he asks. She steps in front of him. "Yeah, of course." "Katniss. . . I want to say that I'll support you no matter what. . ." Katniss sighs in relief, "Oh-" "Wait, wait. That's. . . that's what I want to say. But that's not how I feel . I want to start a life with you. And I don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid. And I'm sorry if that makes me a bad person, but that's how I feel." Gale admits. Katniss draws in a deep breath. "Please. For us." he says again, "Don't have this baby." And with that, he walks away without another word. After her teenage husband, Hunter, told her not to have the baby, Lily had a real problem. She knew she wanted the baby, but she also knew her mother did not want it either. And so, she made her mother promise to keep his identity a secret. "Your grandma asked me to to never tell you what she said, and I. . . I didn't want you to look at her differently." Lily tells her daughter. Katniss smiles, "Look at you, being all selfless. But no more secrets. Okay?" Her mother looks down, "I-I just wanted you to know that you had a choice, because having one – it helps, I think. Whatever you decide." "I don't know what to do, Mom." Katniss shakes her head. "Gale doesn't want it. And I get why, of. . . of course I get why. But Dr. Alver called and said that the father. . . Peeta, he had cancer. This is his only sample, and he and his wife, they're this great couple, loving and wonderful, and all they want is a child." "You want a divorce?!" Glimmer asks her husband. Peeta nods, "I do." "I took care of you when you were sick." she exclaims. He cuts her off, "Which is why I didn't do this a year ago. And I think, if you're being honest, you knew that. I also think it's the reason you used my sample." Glimmer slaps him. "And regardless. . . I think we bring out an ugly side in each other. Don't you think?" He walks away, leaving a stunned Glimmer behind. "Nothing, sir." Gale says. "He had some girl come in there, she took off." His boss use a telescope to peer into Boggs' room, "Boggs' the contact. I'm positive. I.D. the girl." "Already sent the images down to the station." Gale replies. "Lily, some guy's here to see you." the bartender calls out to her. She slips on her jacket, "If it's Bruce, tell him I'm serious. I don't want to see him-" "It's not Bruce." She turns around to see Hunter Everdeen (teenage boyfriend-turned-husband, huge movie star. . . Katniss and Prim's father.) "How could you keep my daughters a secret all these years?" he asks. She shakes her head, "I wrote you sixteen months ago! What took you so long?" Gale hears whoops and wolf-whistles as he looks through the photos of Carter Boggs and the mysterious blonde woman. He looks up to see Katniss walking into the office. "Catnip. . . what are you doing here?" "Trying to be brave. But before I propose. . . you need to know all the facts. And the fact is, I'm having the baby. And we're giving it to the father. He and his wife, they really want it. And they're a really great couple." "She's giving us the baby?" Peeta asks Glimmer. Glimmer nods, "Yes. She just called. She said she wants it to grow up in a happy home, where both parents want it. So, under the circumstances, I thought it best not to mention our previous conversation." Katniss forces a smile, "Gale?" "Yeah." he says. "Okay. I'm okay with that." Katniss laughs, "Okay." She begins to go down on one knee. "Oh. . . you can stand." Gale says, helping her up. She gets up. "Okay, instead of telling you the reasons why I love you, I'm gonna tell you the reasons why I don't." She says. "I don't love you. . . because you're smart and kind. I don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive." "I am not defensive." his co-workers laugh at this before she continues. Her eyes begin to well with tears, "I don't love you because you're incredibly sexy. I love you because you're my best friend. And I want to grow old with you. And right now, I'm confused about every single thing in my life. . . except you." "Wow." Gale whispers. She reaches out to him, "I love you." With that, he pulls her into a deep kiss. And in that moment, in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well, Katniss Everdeen really believed that to be true. And then. . . everything changed. I really hope that you guys enjoyed this! Jane The Virgin is my absolute favorite show, and I've watched it a hundred times over. So when my mind melded my favorite book series and tv show, I couldn't help but write it out for your guys' enjoyment. Now for those who watch the show, not everything will be exactly like it, so please don't get upset if some things change. P.S. – I will update once every two weeks, as I found that this chapter took a long time to write. And I can't use up too much of my time when I have school and athletics to worry about as well. Just wanted to let you guys know. (: With love, Daisy Written : December 6th – 8th, 2015 Posted : March 8th, 2016 (my two year anniversary on this site!)
