Annie as we wait. The train doors open, finally. I thought they would never show up. I turn around to look at them. Rose seems infuriated, and Luke seems calm. What a pair of opposites. "Hello, my name is Finnick Odair, this is my wife, Nikki Odair, and that's Annie Cresta. Mags is probably in her room, resting. We are your Mentors." Finnick introduces us. "Yeah, I already know who you guys are. The whole District has been talking about you guys non-stop." Rose snaps. "It's nice to meet you guys." Luke says sweetly. He walks over to Finnick and shakes his hand. He stops before me next, and shakes my hand. Lastly he goes over to Annie and shakes her hand. I really like Luke. "Nikki!" I hear an urgent whisper from the hallway. I look over and see Silvarius waving me over. It's time. "Uhh…I'll be back, you two got this, and you don't really need me for this part." I excuse myself and quickly walk over to Silvarius. I follow her to me and Finnick's room. "Okay, so this is how it works, just take this out of the box, and pee on it. Yeah, I know, it's gross." She explains. I sigh. "Thank you Silvarius." I say, taking the box from her. I sit down and think of the ocean, the rain, anything to get me to pee. After I pee on the stupid stick, I place it on a piece of toilet paper on the counter. "Okay I'm done." I tell her. She peeks her head in. "Now we wait." She smiles. "How long?" I ask. The longer I'm gone, the more Finnick will want to know what happened. "Like two minutes." She informs me. I lean against the wall. "You're excited about this, huh?" I ask her. "Yes. I remember the excitement of having a baby." She plays with her necklace. "You do?" I ask. I never knew Silvarius had a child. "Yes. But unfortunately, I lost the baby." She says, her eyes glassy. "I'm so sorry Silvarius. That must've been awful." I say. "It was. But I got over it. That's probably why kids don't like me at first." She says. I raise an eyebrow. "I had to distance myself from them, I couldn't bear it. I had to distance myself from my motherly instincts too. When people first meet me, I come across as icy and detached." She clarifies. "Oh. You were just trying to survive. It happens to the best of us." I say. She smiles. "I think it's done." She looks over at it. Her hands immediately fly up to her face, her smile spreading even wider. "I can't look. Is it positive?" I ask. "You are having a baby!" She says, jumping. She hugs me tightly and we jump together. I can't help the smile that finds it way on face. Watching her so happy and joyous is contagious. "When are we telling Finnick?" She asks. "Not until the right time." I say, breathless. "Go out there! I'll clean up in here." She orders, pointing her finger. I run out and see Finnick and Annie sitting on the couch next to each other, and Rose and Luke on the couch in front of them. I take a seat in a chair next to Rose. "Sorry. I just had a fitting." I lie. Finnick gives me a questioning look, and Annie glares out the window. "So what have I missed?" I ask awkwardly. "I can take anyone down that comes after me. I have five brothers. Beat that." Rose spits. She is very obnoxious. If she doesn't shut up, I'll have to 'take her down' myself. Finnick has been training me in hand to hand combat. I've been doing great actually. I'm still the best with knives. "I guess I'm strong. I haul around cargo all day. My dad oversees the storage unit, so I have to help him with carrying stuff." Luke says politely. I nod at the both of them. "Dinner time!" Raquel says, popping out of nowhere. Annie pushes herself off the couch and seats herself at the table. Finnick grabs my hand and sits across from her. Luke takes his seat next to me, and rose sits next to Annie. Raquel sits at the head of the table, like always. Silvarius and our prep teams join us. "Who are these freaks?" Rose asks, gesturing to Lavendaria and Quinton. "We freaks are here to make you look decent, although makeup can only do so much. Your personality will have to stay-" Lavendaria begins to say. "Hey! Look there's hot chocolate." I interject before things can get ugly. Rose glares at her, and Lavendaria grinds her teeth. We continue with dinner, with no more fights. Actually, no one speaks. Silvarius keeps looking at me and giggling. Finnick looks between the two of us, who look too happy, considering what's going on. After dinner is done, we each head off to our own rooms. Mags never came out. I guess she must be really tired. Finnick walks into the bathroom, and starts the water for the shower. "I'm going to take a quick shower." He calls. "Kay." I yell back. "Would you two shut up?!" I hear Rose faintly from the other room. "Can you relax?!" I hear Luke scold her from his own room. I laugh quietly to myself. I pull out my sketchpad and pencils. I start sketching a baby's face. I wonder what our baby will look like. I hope he or she takes after Finnick. He's gorgeous. I continue sketching, and then I hear the water turn off. I snap the book shut and throw it in my nightstand. I can't have Finnick asking any questions. I don't think right now is the right time. It's not special enough. "Nikki…What's this...?" He asks, holding up the stick that told me I was going to be a mother. I cover my face with my hands. Great.
