have feelings for each other" Dani said "Just leave it alone not everyone is meant to be together" Jess said looking out the window as they finished the 15 min drive to Dani's house ~…~ "So, Danny and Joe are trying to convince me to to join the academy, but I have to say I'm leaning towards Harvard Law" Jaime said as the gang reunited at Dani's house "Seriously though has there ever been a Walsh that wasn't a cop" Stefan said grabbing another handful of veggie straws "What does Pop think of this" Dani said referring to Jaime's grandfather "He wants to keep the tradition alive, Dad wants whatever makes me happy, and Mom hopes I stick with wanting to be a lawyer that way she doesn't have to worry about another son" Jaime said leaning back onto the recliner "Well whatever you decide we have your back, always" Dani smiled "Hey…we got Pizza" Matt yelled as he entered the house with Lucas, Ryan and Emmett trailing behind "How was practice" Dani asked as she got up to get the plates and napkins "Great your brother is one hell of a coach, we might actually have a chance at winning" Matt said "Well at least someone appreciates my talents" Emmett said grabbing a beer from the fridge as Dani jokingly rolled her eyes and pushed him away from the fridge "What does everyone want to drink" Dani called out "Gatorade" Lucas called "Iced tea" Stefan said "Dr. Pepper" Ryan hollered grabbing a slice from Stefans plate "Mountain Dew" Matt said with a mouth full of pizza "Coke" Jamie said as he got up to help her with the drinks "Sparkling lemon water" Jess said "Hey the gangs all here" Esme said as she and Carlisle walked through the door "Hey Dr. Cullen, Mrs. Cullen" They all said "How was the first day" Carlisle asked as he and Esme grabbed slices and drinks and joined the kids at the table "Eventful, especially when J…" Matt started to say but Jaime kicked his leg and Dani took over "When Jess asked Lucas to the dance" Dani finished "Well good for you Jessica, changing the roles around" Esme applauded "Thank you Esme" Jess said "Jaime, hows your grandfather doing" Carlisle asked "He's doing well thank you" Jaime said "Hey guys, bye guys" Alice ran through the door, through the house "Alice don't you want a slice theres Ceaser" Dani asked "Maybe later" Alice said running upstairs "The daily struggle of being a fashion intern" Esme said "I smell pizza" Jasper and Edward said as they too came home "We got Ceaser, pepperoni, regular, and artichoke" Dani announced "So how was practice with Emmett" Edward asked Matt "Oh please don't start" Jess and Dani groaned "It was great, we might actually have a chance at winning this year" Matt ignored the girls "Next Friday is homecoming, if we practice 4 days a week 2 hrs a day, I'd say you guys have a good chance of winning" Emmett said as he reached for his third slice "I forgot how close Homecoming is, Dani that means we have less than two weeks to find a dress" Jess gasped as Dani and Jamie tried to avoid eye contact with the gang "You're going to the dance" Emmett, Jasper, and Edward said at the same time "Um, yea why not someone has to watch this one" Dani tried to joke as she nudged Jess "So no one asked you to the dance" Emmett asked "Emmett Xavier Cullen" Esme yelled smacking him in the head as the guys snickered "Actually I did" Jaime said out of no where as everyone looked at him "Wait, are you two together" Edward asked "Umm" Dani said wishing she could just disappear "Why dont we change the subject" Jess said "Good idea" Dani said as she bit small pieces of her left over pizza. After the embarrassing moment involving her and Jaime, the rest of the night continued with laughter jokes and comfortable conversation. " Sorry about my brothers outburst" Dani texted Jaime from a few feet away " My family is full of cops, theres no secrets or privacy allowed" Jaime responded " Apparently that also applies to younger siblings" Dani said with a laughing emoji "Danielle" Esme said when she saw her daughter on the phone. "Yes" Dani responded casually "Who on earth are you texting, everyone is here" Esme said as Jess looked towards her "Just checking my email" Dani said quickly opening her email and showing her mom "Smooth move" Jess whispered as Dani nudged her to silence her as all of a sudden an array of car horns beeped in signaling that everyones ride had arrived "10:30 already" Matt groaned "Man they are never late" Lucas said "The joys of living in the neighborhood" Stefan said "So I guess I'll see you tomorrow" Jaime said rubbing his neck "Yea and hey listen I'm sorry about Emmett" Dani said as she walked him to the door "Hey no worries I have older brothers too" Jamie smiled as his brother Danny honked on the horn. "I'm coming" Jaime shouted "You should probably get going, its pretty late for a school night" Dani said leaning against the doorframe "Yea, goodnight" Jaime said as he kissed her cheek "Goodnight" Dani whispered as she closed the door behind her ~…~ "I'm going to bed, goodnight" Dani said to her parents after she cleaned up after everyone left "Honey wait, you and Jaime" Esme began before Dani stopped her "Mom he just asked me to homecoming we haven't talked about anything else" Dani groaned "Do you want this to evolve into something else" Esme asked "Maybe, I don't know, somedays I do, but somedays I'm like I don't want to ruin the friendship we have" Dani sighed "Only time will tell, never ignore your feelings. Goodnight baby" Esme said as she watched her daughter walk and close the door to her bedroom
