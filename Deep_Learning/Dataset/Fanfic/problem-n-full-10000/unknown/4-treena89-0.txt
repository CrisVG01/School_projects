caught you talking to my belly in the middle of the night, I couldn`t help but pretend to sleep and listen as you would tell are baby everything and anything, At 70 years old "I couldn`t believe I was burying my husband, I loved him so much" I hold that hands of all my children on and off all day long, Everyone that knew you comes out and tries to give their support, All I want is to go home and lay down, in our bed, where we use to sleep together, This was a shocker, a heart attack; I thought you were so healthy, The doctor said we were both still healthy for our age, By the end of the day and having been passed around by everyone, Having been giving to many hugs and handshakes to care about, All I wanted was you today, all I could do was think about you and our life together, All of our happy moments, all of our fights, all the people that have tried to come between us over the years, I will never be able to keep living on in this world knowing you are not in it, Once I am home for the night, all our children refuse to leave my side, It takes a more days than I expect but I finally have my mask in place, My heart is breaking and I refuses to think about you it hurts to much, But I have to keep going for our children and grandchildren, they are not ready to lose the both of us yet, At 80 years old "Slowly dying of a broken heart" I have come and visited your grave every Sunday afternoon since the day you were buried here, It has been 10 years now since I lost my heart, waking up to your side of the bed being cold every morning has been heart breaking, I am slowly allowing myself to remember all that we have lived through, I just wished we could have started together at 16 not 30 something, After placing flowers on your grave and making sure the stone is not dirty, I head home for the evening, tears slowly running down my cheeks, My chest hurts, feels like something is pushing on it, making it hard to breath, I feel like something is pulling my heart out of my chest, I skip diner that night and go straight to bed early, I can feel what is about to happen, I call all my children before I lay for my rest making sure to tell them all I love them and miss them, They all keep asking me if I'm okay, our son Tony says he's on his way, His family lives the closes to our home, Once you passed they moved close, He worries of me too much, just like you always did, he picked right up on that job, I can feel it, I am not going to wake up, and I swear I can feel your fingers on my cheek, Running through my hair, down my neck, across my collarbone, sweet kisses being place along the way, your cold breath fanning across my exposed skin, You always did like me in the silk short dressed nighties, You always told me I was the beautiful creature you had ever seen, kissed, touched, tasted, I close my eyes and within no time at all I can hear you whispering my name, I open my eyes, you are hovering over me with your hand extended, you look 18 again, and your eyes are sparkling and shining, I reach my hand out taking yours; you pull me off the bed and right into your arms, You are smiling so brightly at me, you lean down and kiss me so softly, You whisper my name against my lips, I tell you a missed you in return, You tell me together forever, even if we have to wait at times, I look behind myself and notice my lifeless body sleeping in our bed, I hear a sound and look over to the door, I notice Tony has showed up, Edward smiles at him and says he is so proud of our boy, all our children really, Tony leans down and kisses my forehead then picks up the phone beside the bed and starts calling everyone to tell them I'm gone. You tell me it's time to go to heaven, that we have some new choices to make, You tell me we can stay in heaven or be reborn, try our lives again, I tell you I need to think about it, but for now all I want to be is in your arms, You tell me you have a surprise for me, you kiss me again and we are off floating through the clouds We are sitting on a cloud looking down watching the sun come up, you tell me we can watch our children and grandkids from here You tell me you have been with me all along, no matter what, You point to another cloud and a man I know is sitting down on the cloud beside us, My father, that's your surprise to me, I love you so much Edward Cullen We spend a large amount of time just talking and hugging and laughing, You have always been watching, as I knew you were, I missed my father so much, I just hope that in our next life when we take it, we will always be together, no problems or troubles, I love you Edward Cullen, Together forever and ever and everâ€¦.
