"I figured she'd lost enough. I didn't want the distraction," he said, speaking about dating. "Yeah. I just…I picked such a jerk for her father. He doesn't even…he's never…you know?" she said. "Finish your sentences, Becker. You know that drives me crazy." "I was drunk. I never even looked him up. Never saw him again. Never wanted to. Probably some traveling salesman…with a wife and a mortgage." She felt immediate horror that she'd divulged this. And to her boss. Confusing as this was. "I wasn't like that. I mean…I can't hold my liquor. Hence the long…abstinence." "From alcohol or sex?" He asked this rather boldly. They laughed some. But he was asking. "I haven't dated," she said. That's all he was getting. But yes, she was a nun without the religious part. "Do you miss it? The guy thing?" he said. No. This was too much. She didn't even tell herself the answer to these questions. "I…I'm busy with work. Sara. My…my life is full. I don't have time…. I don't have…. It's very full." "Yeah," he said softly. "It's amazing how many parts of yourself you can shut off if you have to. Doesn't make them go away," he smiled. But it was sad. "I don't know," she said. But she did know. He was going to be sorry they had talked like this. They had to work together. He'd never given any clue…. Actually, if he had, even six months ago, she might have quit. "I learned something, Bridie. Right? You suffer. You learn, right?" She stayed still. "I learned how short time is. How you need to be in the moment. Seize it like they say. There are no guarantees about tomorrow, but that's no reason to miss right now." There was a semi-awkward silence. No, more poignant than awkward. "I thought I was the idealist," she said. He didn't look at her, but the corner of his mouth lifted a little. She put her gaze back on the girls. "I'm trying. To be present." "Then don't run away when I tell you I've been waiting to ask you out for two years." She couldn't look away anymore. "Two years, Mason. Seriously?" He still wasn't looking at her. "You gave no indication…." "I knew you weren't ready" he interrupted, eyes piercing again. "I knew you were closed off. And I wasn't sure I was ready either. So I was stuck there for a while." He took a deep breath. They both did. "Then the picnic," he said. "Our girls." "Sara was begging," she said. "Did you avoid it?" "I don't know. Yes." "Ever wonder why?" "Scared, I guess. And that was before I knew it meant anything…else." "Are you sorry you're here?" he said. She worked to keep it honest because of a real desire to lie. "I'm not sorry," she said. She felt his relief. He bumped her with his elbow, then he kept it there. "The other day you were in my office…and I knew it was time. Sink or swim, do or die. I said if she comes over…I'm going to lay it out." "Mason…," she wanted to give him an out. He was saying so much. "Just listen, Bridie. I don't want to waste any more time." She shook her head a little. "Mason. I need my job. It's a lot." "It's nothing compared to what we've been through. Right? We're soldiers already. This is good, Bridie. It could be. We…could be good." It had gotten heavy. He took her hand and said, "C'mon." It was time for that tour. But she could barely take it in. Her head was still in the kitchen. She snapped too a little when they reached the bedroom. That room was the most difficult, but only at first. It was his now. Just like hers was only hers. Life had continued past what he once knew, what he once had. It was a slow moving train that never stopped. And while she was on it…she looked at Mason as they stood on the balcony off of his bedroom and watched their girls play in the yard. Her great unease had not been because he was her boss. "We're very different, you know," she said. "No, we're not," he said quickly. "We're a lot alike on the stuff that matters," he said. "How are you so sure?" she said. "I've had a lot of time to think about it. To notice. I like your black pants, by the way. And that white blouse? Those are the best days, Becker." She laughed. "That's…outrageous." "Wait a minute. What I'm getting at? These jeans are my favorite." He glanced down and his eyes were alight. He took her breath. "Don't get so taken aback," he said, waving to his daughter to let her know he saw her cartwheel. "You notice me, too." "What? As my boss!" He just laughed. Notice him? It hit her. The truth. At work…he was her focal point. Her head felt swimmy. And at home, in-between being mommy, he was often…her focal point. Crap! And the real truth…as long as she saw him, crawling if he must, but as long as she saw him refusing to quit…on life, it gave her courage. That's it. He had always given her courage. And what she knew as she studied him…in some sneaky way…she was already on the road to loving him. "So when would we do this?" she asked, her voice thin. "Date?" He looked at her and rotated on his elbow against the railing. "What about Friday night?" he said. "Dinner?" "With the girls?" "Yeah. For a few times at least. Then…just us." "Yeah? Just us?" "Yeah. You ready…Bridie?" "I don't know." But she did know. "Maybe I'll get ready Mason. How about that?" He leaned in and she met him. They kissed softly and the girls kicked up from the yard below with oohs and aahs, and that was the best way to describe how she felt.
