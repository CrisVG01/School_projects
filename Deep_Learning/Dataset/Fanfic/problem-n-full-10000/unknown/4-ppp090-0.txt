Edward. " "Why'd you say it like that?" Geez, I am nosy, aren't I? "I didn't. You're a psycho-" "Renesmee." Edward warned. Okay, dad. Geez. He cleared his throat. It made me feel bad... I don't know why... But, of course he's like her dad- he's her blood relation, despite having been adopted into the Cullen family. That's probably why Bella acts like her mom, too. "It's a left here, then three houses down." I pointed, despite the fact that he couldn't see me in the backseat of the car. Real smart, Scar. "Is that in the reservation?" Edward almost slowed into a complete stop before turning into the street. "Nope. We're, like, bordering it. It's awesome." They're always running around shirtless on the beach and I have the best view of it. "Don't tell Renesmee." "What?" Me and Nessie said at the same time. His eyes flickered in the mirror and he winked at me. Oh my god, he's totally reading my mind. Awesome. I always wanted a super power. Yes. I'm one of those people. I love X-Men, and the Avengers and all of that. It sucks that Edward has one and I don't. Thanks, universe. Edward chuckled, "Okay, I'll see you two later?" He asked. "Yeah, see ya'." I jumped out and grabbed my back pack. "Love you!" Nessie kissed his cheek and climbed out. "Love you too." Edward grinned. "Love you three." I butted in. I can't help it. I think I'm really funny, don't you know? "Bye, girls." He pulled away and Nessie grabbed my hand, pulling me to my front door. "Come on!" She knocked on the door. "Ness, it's my house." I opened the door. "Momma!" "Girlie-whirley!" She skipped into the room. "Mom, I'm staying at the Cullen's house tonight, we're working on a project too, so don't think I'm slacking." "I won't." Mom laughed. She said hello to Nessie and the two started chatting about trees and what-not, so I ran upstairs. I went into my plain, blue, messy-as-hell bedroom. I packed a bag, grabbed my bio work and ran to the window. "Yes, run little shirtless men, run." I whispered to myself and laughed at my creepiness. I nearly screamed when I heard the floorboard creek. "Creep." Nessie came to the window. She started looking too. "I could say the same about you!" "I'm looking for Jacob." "Oh, yeah. He lives in La Push. Duh." "Yeah. They're setting up a bonfire." "Okay, La Push-expert." I pulled my eyes away from the very attractive men and grabbed her arm. "Come on." "Alright, mother! We're leaving!" "Your principle called." "No... no, he didn't?" "Yes, he did." "Nessie has to be home in ten minutes. Right, Nessie?" "What? No... I mean... y-yes?" "Fine. We'll talk tomorrow." "Awesome." We ran out the door. We were walked for around twenty minutes. Thank god she was lying about the ten minute curfew thing. "You do know where you're going, right?" "Of course. We just live really far from the reservation." "Oh. Well... can you carry me?" "No way." "And to think, I thought we were best friends ." "We are!" She kept walking, faster than me, who was being overtaken by snails, but stopped and walked back to me, crouching ever so slightly. "Aw, Ness." I jumped up, she flinched, but seemed to be fine with my weight. Awesome, we'd definitely do this again. "Run, Renesmee. I'm bored." "Ugh. You're a slave driver." "Yeah, but I'm awesome, so, that makes up for it." That night was awesome. Me and Ness had the best time, like we'd had sleepovers a thousand times before. We played monopoly (I lost), 20 Questions (I lost), Grand Theft Auto (I won) and stayed up all night chatting. Her family had 'gone to dinner' for hours and came back in messy clothes that made them look like they'd been running in the forest all night. I laughed at the twigs in her mother's (Esme) hair. They'd apparently gotten into a play fight on the way back. Why can't my family be that awesome?! Seth POV. "Ness?" Jacob and I walked into the ridiculously clean bedroom of Renesmee. It was white and innocent, with pictures of Nessie, the Cullens and even some of us. Mostly Jake, but I stole the show in one of them. "I missed you!" She threw her arms around Jake and everything got a little bit... Over PG-13. "Hello?" "Oh... Seth... I forgot you were there." Jacob said. I rolled my eyes but smiled anyway. They were in love. I couldn't blame them. I just... really wanted an imprint. The two went back to kissing and hugging and recovering from being away from each other for a whole eight hours (and we all know that Jacob was here all night). I stared at the photos on the wall, looking at a selection of five in particular. The girl was someone I didn't recognise, but, DAMN, could Paul make an inappropriate comment about her. Not only that, she was... well, I don't like to talk about girls that way... but she was... really, really hot. She had this... charm to her. She was mocking the camera and mocking the person looking at the photo. "Hey, Ness, who's this girl?" "Oh, my friend. Well... I think she's my friend. I hope she is." "She's..." "Really 'hot'? I know. She acts like she's not and doesn't really bother trying much, though. She's convinced she's 'fugly' though." "Why haven't you introduced her to us?" "Paul." "Oh. Introduce me ." "She's not much of a people person-" "Nessie, please." "Okay, for you, Seth." "Ness! You're gonna be late." Jacob practically pulled her out of the door to leave. Thanks for reading. I know that romance hasn't happened yet, but it will next chapter. I was just introducing Scarlett and her relationship with the Cullen's, before she met the wolves. Also, a special sneak preview to anyone who guesses who Scarlett bumped into in the office!
