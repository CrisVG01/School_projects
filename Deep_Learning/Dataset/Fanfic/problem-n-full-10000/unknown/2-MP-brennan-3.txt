wolf fell with a yelp, an arrow embedded in its shoulder. But, instead of slinking away to die, the creature gathered itself for one last spring. Aragorn's second arrow caught it in the throat. The wolf fell and did not move again. Staring down at the body, Aragorn shook his head. It had been decades since he'd allowed himself to become sentimental over an animal, but this one was something of a kindred spirit—a fellow loner, a fellow fighter. Wolves weren't meant to walk alone, any more than Men were. If there had been even one more of the creatures, he might have been the one to see his journey cut short. The thought was sobering. The thought was strangely hopeful. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ Once he left the splendor of the mountains behind him, he did not feel quite so small. His long legs served him well in the trek north through Hollin. This was familiar country. It offered easy passage, and plenty of time to marshal his thoughts like half-trained soldiers. He thought of all the glory that the line of Elendil had brought to Arda and all that it might yet bring, but that was nothing but petty vanity beside her grace. He thought of everything that Elrond himself had taught him about how the Doom of Men was, in fact, a Gift and not to be feared, but he knew he was not cruel enough to turn those lessons against the teacher. By the time he stood once more at the foothills of the mountains, less than an hour's journey from the secret valley, he was left with no argument but the one he felt in his bones: that he could accomplish anything and pay any price if he could but be with her all of his days. It was not enough. Evening was falling, but enough daylight remained. He knew this country like he knew his own heart. He could easily find the Last Homely House, even in the fading light. Instead, he made camp just over a league away and waited for the dawn. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ Morning brought no answers, at least no easy ones. High mountains now lay between him and his beloved. Her absence left an ache in his chest. It served as a reminder that the choice had already been made. The morning was not even half gone when he reached Imladris. Erestor met him at the gates with a smile and a warm clasp of his hands. "Welcome home, Estel. It has been a long time." He smiled at Elrond's chief counselor. "Only as Men account it." "Lord Elrond is expecting you." Aragorn swallowed. "Expecting me?" "Indeed, we expected you last night." There was a mild reproof in Erestor's voice. Aragorn looked away. Had he been tracked by an Elven patrol? Or had the Lord of Imladris simply foreseen his return? "The journey was long." It was not really an answer, but it gave him something to say. "No doubt. It is good that you have safely reached the end of it." Aragorn fell in step beside the Elf, and together they crossed over the splashing river and passed through graceful archways into the familiar confines of the house. "He awaits you in his study." Aragorn tamped down on the panic those words caused him. He'd hoped to make his appeal in his own time on his own terms. Instead, it appeared he would not even have a chance to wash away the dust of the road. Not that it would have mattered; Elrond could always see who he was, regardless of his raiment. Erestor paused to pull something long and slim out of a cabinet near the entryway. "He bade you wear this." The Man pulled away a loose cloth and immediately recognized the scabbard that held the Shards of Narsil. He grasped the hilt and drew a foot of steel from the sheath. He glanced up at Erestor. "I left this here for safekeeping." "And it is being returned to you." He bit his lip, pondering what it might mean that Elrond wished to see him arrayed with this symbol of his heritage. Pushing his qualms away, he sheathed the shard and buckled the scabbard to his belt. "My thanks." He offered Erestor a brief bow. "I'd best not keep him waiting any longer." /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ Elrond's study had changed little over the decades, but Aragorn had never before seen it like this. Though the sun was high in the sky, heavy curtains were drawn over all the windows. The only light came from the crackling fire in the hearth. Elrond was a shadow silhouetted against those flames. He stared into them silently, his hands clasped loosely behind his back. He turned at Aragorn's approach, but slowly—like an old Man. Aragorn bowed. "Master Elrond," he said formally, "You do me honor by receiving me." Elrond's face was set in lines of care, but he was not scowling. He had the look of one who feels his heart rent in two, but has resolved to stand silent in the face of that pain. "Aragorn." His eyes glinted in the low light. In that moment, Aragorn realized that he had foreseen this meeting. Perhaps he had been expecting it for years. "You have something you wish to ask of me." Aragorn swallowed. He looked at the ground. "Yes, my lord." His chest ached. He had made a promise. He forced himself to look up, to meet Elrond's gaze and let him see the love that was written there. "I wanted to speak to you . . . about Arwen." /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ " A shadow lies between us. Maybe it was appointed so, that by my loss the kingship of Men may be restored. Therefore, though I love you, I say to you: Arwen Undómiel shall not diminish her life's grace for less cause. She shall not be the bride of any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor." Fin
