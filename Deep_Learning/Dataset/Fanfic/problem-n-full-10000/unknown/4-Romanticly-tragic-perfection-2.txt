Harry," he said. Bella argued. Jacob argued. She yelled… And screamed… And threatened… "I can't keep dealing with this!" he yelled. "Are you leaving me?" she asked. Jacob didn't answer. He phased and ran into the trees. Bella stood frozen. "She jumped off a cliff," Sam said. Jacob sat in his room, defeated. "I shouldn't have left her," he said, lighting a cigarette. "Since when do you smoke?" Sam asked. Jacob laughed bitterly. "Since my life turned to shit," he said. Bella lay in the hospital. "Where's Jacob?" she croaked. Charlie sat at her bedside. "You jumped off a cliff," he said. "I tripped," she said. Charlie looked at her. "You tried to kill yourself," he said. Bella glared at him. "I tripped, Charlie," she said. "I should have sent you to that facility," he said. "I'm eighteen. You can't send me anywhere," she said. "I did it because I don't want to live if you didn't want me." She said. Jacob sat there. "Don't ever do anything like that again!" he said. Bella nodded. "As long as you never leave me again." She said. Jacob said nothing. He just grabbed her hand and held it. He was tired. She was his daughter. He loved her. But a part of him wished she hadn't come out of the ocean. And that made him need a drink more than ever. "I love you Bella," Jacob said. She smiled. "I love you too." She said. "I hate you so much." She said. Jacob took another drag of his cigarette. "You are nothing but a monster." She said, throwing a book at him. "You're worthless and you'll always be worthless." She said. Jacob closed his eyes and pretended that it didn't hurt. "Do you hate me, Dad?" she asked. Charlie shook his head. "No of course not," he said. Bella smiled. "I'll go make dinner," she said. Charlie nodded. Why did it feel like he was lying? "You are mine. You're the only thing that makes my life worth living." She said. Jacob smiled. But inside he felt nothing. "I love you," he said. Bella frowned. "Prove it," she said, kissing him. "I don't know what to do," he said. "Please mom, tell me what to do," he cried. His cellphone rang. He looked at him mom's grave. "Hello?" he said. "I need you to be here," Bella said. Jacob nodded. "I'm on the way." He said, hanging up. He took one last look at her grave and left. "You're hurting them!" Edward's voice said. Bella shrugged. "So? You hurt me." She said. "You can't keep doing this to them." He said. Bella smirked. "Watch me," she said. "You are wasting your time," she said. Charlie looked up. "I'm not your little girl anymore." She said. "Then who are you?" he asked. Bella looked away. "I don't know," she said and broke down crying. "Why are you doing this?" Edward's voice asked. Bella looked at him. "I don't know," she said. "Who are you talking to?" Jacob asked. Bella frowned. Her nails digging into her palm. "Nobody," she said, standing up. "You need to let her go, Jake," Sam said. "That girl will be the death of you," Billy said. Jacob chuckled darkly and took a long drag of his cigarette before crushing it under his foot. "Don't you guys get it," he said, eyes growing colder. "I'm already dead," he said, emotionlessly. "You have to let him go," Billy begged. "No!" Bella shouted. "You're hurting him!" Billy yelled. "I don't care!" she said and knocked him out of his chair. "Why can't I stop?" Bella cried. "Because you're a monster," Edward's voice said. "Congratulations!" he said. Bella sobbed and curled into a ball. "I hate this," she whispered. "What?" Charlie asked, looking up from the TV. "The silence," she said. "Don't you feel anything anymore?" he asked. Bella looked at Jacob. "I hate you," she hissed. "Is that feeling enough for you!" she yelled. She started throwing things. "Are you drunk?" Billy asked. Jacob laughed. "Yes, I…*hic*…think…so?" he said and passed out. "Bella?" he called. "Go away!" she yelled. "What's going on?" he asked. "I wish you had left me in those woods. I wish you had left me there." She yelled. Charlie was lost. He wished he knew what to do? Jacob lay on the floor. "Wake up!" Bella yelled, kicking him. The empty bottles of her pills just lay there. "Wake up!" she begged. The cans of beer sat on the dresser. There had to be at least 20. "Wake up!" she cried. There was a cigarette still lit in the ash tray. "Please…I need you." She said. There was a letter on the bed with her name on it. "You promised me!" Billy called 911. "You said you loved me!" Jacob never opened his eyes. She sat in the hospital. "He said he'd never leave me," she said, bitterly. Charlie slapped her so hard she fell out of her chair. "Stop pretending to be the victim!" he yelled. "If that boy dies it'll be your fault!" he growled. Bella rubbed her cheek. "Why daddy?" she asked. "Because You Are A Monster! Because I watched you suck the life out of that boy and I said nothing. You tortured him Bella!" Charlie yelled. "I loved him!" she yelled. "You don't love anybody." Charlie said. "Not Jacob, not me… you need a heart to love someone." He said and left. The light in her eyes faded. She'd finally gotten her wish. She was a monster. Just not the one she wanted to be.
