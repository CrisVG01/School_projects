I closed my eyes for two reasons. 1) I was scared, and I don't like being grabbed. 2) My eye's were starting to hurt from the light. When I opened my eye's, I was in a dark room. My eye's had to adjust to the darkness, and when they finally did, I was amazed. Sure, my uncle was gone. And sure, I was just kidnapped. But, really, the room itself was amazing. The roof was, higher than any roof I had ever seen. The walls were dark red, with symbols all over it. There was a grand, but dim, chandelier hanging on the roof. A table was set up against the wall, and papers were stacked on top. The floor was also dark red, but clear of symbols. Maps were pinned to the wall, along with posters of Nash Grier and Justin Bieber. I, was on the floor. My kidnapper was no where to be seen. I wondered where Uncle Randolph was. I got to my feet and took a step. Some alarm went off./span/strong/p p style="margin: 0px;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""What the..." A hand covered my mouth, and me, being the stronger person, yanked it away and spun around. A girl about my age stared back at me. She had blonde hair and blue eye's. She was very pretty, but I forced that out of my head quickly. She was the one who kidnapped me. The alarm was still blaring. Something grabbed my back and threw me into the wall. Great. Now my head and back hurt, emand/em my head was ringing from the alarm, which was still on. Suddenly, the alarm stopped, but my head kept on ringing. A man's face appeared before me. He glared at me and left my view./span/strong/p p style="margin: 0px;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""He's dead," the man said.
