up in shock, I looked into his eyes to see if he was serious and then bust out into a fit of laughter, oh my god I wasn't expecting that shit. When I finally calmed down I looked up at him again "well in that case you're welcome." I said with a smirk playing on my lips. He stared into my eyes, stood up and walked over to me...he held out his hand and said "Edward." Suddenly I was at a loss what to say. I was pinned by his stare, It felt like his eyes could swallow me whole, I was struck dumb for a second. Inside my head was screaming…'fucking snap out of it Bella and speak for god sake!'...yeah that did it. I finally took his hand with great effort I might add. As soon as our hands touched I was hit by a bolt of electricity, it shot straight up my arm and made me gasp in surprise, my eyes shot to his to see it he felt it too but his face was calm almost blank, his eyes piercing mine. I cleared my throat and said "Bella" He kept a hold of my hand a little longer than necessary, when he finally let go he said "I'll see you around baby girl." Well ok then...that was slightly weird I thought but, true to Bella form I had to snark back and say "I have a name you know" as I sat back in my chair and folded my arms across my chest. He stood there looking at me for a second, and then unleashed the most dazzling smile, it could make you go weak at the knees, my breath hitch in my throat, which he must have heard because it made him smile wider if that was even possible, then he said "Oh I know baby girl, I'll be seeing you very soon" then the fucker walked away! "Fucker!" I said, and heard laughter as he walked through the door. I looked over my shoulder and watched as 2 men in suits flanked him on either side. I watched him walked to the black flashy car that sat in front of the window. Just before he got into the back seat he looked up at me and smirked...yeah he weren't getting away with that...so I smirked right back at him...and then gave him the finger and laughed at the shocked look on his face. The 2 guys in suits that were with him also laughed, which in turn made me smile wider as he got in his car and drove away. I sat back and looked at Alice who was now supporting the shocked look "Well that was interesting" I said with a nod and took a mouthful of my food. "Yeah id fucking say so. What the hell was that?" she asked as if I had all the answers. "I have no idea what just happened" I said. "I was just trying to prove a point...it kinda got out of hand and then went right out the window from there" I said confused. "I think he likes you" She said with a goofy smile. "Don't be silly...I'll probably never see him again anyway, besides I don't have time for a man now I have the bar to get up and running." I said, I could just imagine her trying to set me up. "I kinda recognise him from somewhere, but I can't put my finger on it. I will say he looked mighty fine in that suit though, he had an air about him...kinda screamed respect and danger...I don't need that" I said looking at her. "Yeah I know what you mean, I can't put my finger on it either, Oh well, we'd better get going...that delivery will here any minute" she said, yeah I wasn't looking forward to that. We paid the check and headed back to the bar, just as the delivery truck turned up, I felt a slight unease wash over me...like I was being watched. I turned around and scanned the street, I saw nothing there...strange not only have I got a big mouth, I've also lost my mind...great!. By the time we'd set the table and chairs up, and set them in their right spots. We unpacked the fridges and turned them on behind the bar, we were finally finished…it took hours, and I was knackered. We just had the bar to stock, the interviews to get through and then when the slot machines and pool table turned up, I'd place those..oh and lets not forget dressing the place as Alice puts it, it's all about the little things...yeah whatever. It was finally time to go home. I shut the door and felt the same shudder I did earlier, I looked around as I locked the door but saw nothing, so I brushed it off. I said goodnight to Alice and told her I'd see her tomorrow and then got in my car to drive went home, it didn't take long. I went straight in made a sandwich, had a shower to wash the sweat and grime of my day off me, set my alarm and crawled into bed..it wasn't long before I was in the land of nod dreaming of green eyes with thick lashes. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ HEY GUYS ..ERM I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS STORY IS GOING, I KINDA OF JUST STARTED WRITING WHAT WAS IN MY HEAD I WAS MAKING IT UP AS I WENT ALONG I HAD NO SET PLAN IT KINDA JUST TURNED INTO A CHAPTER, I GONNA TRY EDWARD 'S POV NEXT, I DO KNOW I WANT EDWARD IN THE MOB NEXT IN LINE FOR THE BOSS AND I WANT HIM ROOFLESS AND COLD AND I WANT BELLA THE SAME BUT I WANT THEM TO BREAK EACH OTHER DOWN AND WORK TOGETHER WITH IN THE "FAMILY"...ANY IDEAS?, I HAVE SOME IDEAS IT'S JUST GETTING IT DOWN IN WORDS I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH!
