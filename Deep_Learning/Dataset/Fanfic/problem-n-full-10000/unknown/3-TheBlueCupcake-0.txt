I find out today." Percy whispered. " I am late on my period so I did the test." She took another gulp from her beer. "I tested positive. Guess who is going to be a mommy." Clarisse smashed the bottle Percy was drinking from out of the girls hand. "What the Hades?!" "You are pregnant you idiot you can't drink beer or anything with alcohol." Clarisse explained. "Really? So the stork doesn't bring them?" Percy asked playing dumb " Of course I know that, I just thought who cares. I could take an abortion." "You? An abortion? Don't make me laugh, Perce." Clarisse laughed. "I know, I know… Maybe I should talk to Solis, I mean Apollo." Percy said. "You want to talk to the man who kidnapped you and raped. So you just go talk to him about if you should keep the baby? What do you think he is going to say? No let's do an abortion because I raped you without any reason. Man, sometimes I think you really have seaweed in that brain of yours. Did you even think about what your dad is going to say? He is going to be furious, he will kill Apollo." Clarisse explained. "I will go to bed." Percy whispered. "Tomorrow we will tell Chiron." Clarisse stated. "What? No!" Percy yelled. "So you don't want to tell him? Why? You need to accept the fact that you are pregnant and he will know what to do." Clarisse explained. "You. Bed. Now." "Yes ma'am" Percy whispered before going to bed. BREAK Clarisse had dragged Percy out of her room an hour ago to force her to eat breakfast and to drink some water. After that she had forced Percy to go talk to Chiron. The centaur and Mr. D were playing a card game on the porch. "Perry, Chloe." Mr. D. acknowledge. "Percy, Clarisse what can I do for you two?" Chiron asked. "I need to tell you something Chiron." "Alright." Chiron said. "Well … You see it is about … Apollo." Percy whispered. The god and the centaur looked shocked at the girl in front of them. "Teak a seat." Chiron offered. "Thank you." Percy whispered. "So when I was with Apollo a lot of things happened and one of them was him … raping me. A week after the first time I got sick like really sick. I had to throw up and that kind of stuff… Eventually when he came to visit he said it was the flu and that I wasn't pregnant. He then forced himself a second time on me … only with a purpose this time … and he succeeded you could say." Percy whispered. Everyone kept silent. This was the first time she had talked about it with someone. " There is one other tiny detail I have been hiding. Apollo asked me to marry him a month of two ago." "You have to be kidding me." Clarisse started. "That jerk kidn – " "You were going to say yes isn't it." Chiron asked. Percy nodded, tears running down her cheeks. Clarisse stared stunned at Percy. "You are in love with him? That is why you wanted to go visit him! You really are an idiot!" Clarisse exclaimed. "You know that it really isn't that easy. I was alone for gods now how long. He was the only person is saw. You don't know what he did. Would you raise your kid alone when you know that the father is out there and there might be a chance for the two of you." Percy cried. "Let's take you to gods. I am sure uncle Poseidon would love to hear this development." Mr. D. stated, flashing the four of them to the throne room. "What have you done?" Percy whispered. Slowly all the gods appeared in their thrones. The last one to arrive was Hermes. "Percy what is the matter?" Poseidon asked kindly. "I… I …I needed to tell you something." Percy explained. "Now … You see… I have been thinking about somethings and I thought you would like to know … So here I am … About to tell you." "You are avoiding the question." Athena exclaimed. Percy sighed. "Oh gods. If she needs to tell it we will be here for days. One she is pregnant. Two Apollo asked her to marry her and she was considering and she wants to talk to him." Clarisse explained. "What?" – "that explains the vibes I get from her." – "that explains why she is so thin." "Something else." Poseidon asked softly. "Yes." Percy said quietly. "I want to become a god and preferably in the sea." Poseidon sighed. "You can say a lot about you Percy but you sure don't disappoint." "I like to do six impossible things for breakfast." She told them. "Well I will arrange everything and in a few hours you will be a god until then dismissed." Zeus declared. "Wait I need to see him." Percy said. "Fine. Follow me." She followed Zeus and her protesting father to the house of Apollo. The house was yellow and gold. Surprise. The sun was figured a couple of times together with the bow and the air. "If you are in danger, just give a scream." Percy nodded as response. She entered the golden building, the inside was beautiful modern but classic. "Dad? Is that you. Ow." "I became an ow?" Percy joked. "What are you doing here? You aren't save here." Apollo exclaimed. "Someone told me that is gave to many second chances." Percy joked. "You know, you did it. I am pregnant and I want to marry you. You made me fall in love with you. But next time just a date no kidnapping." "You are serious?" Apollo asked stunned. "I am. Everybody declares me on nuts or Stockholm syndrome." Percy laughed. "But I am sure Aphrodite called it love." She gave Apollo a passionate kiss on the moment . THE END
