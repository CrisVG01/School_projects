bed," I told her. "What?" Tyler said. "No. This is your bed-" "Which I'm letting you use," I interrupted. "It's only one night." "We could share the bed," she offered. "It's big enough for three." "Just sleep on the bed," I said. "I'll take the floor." "Why the floor?" she asked. "I could take the floor. I'm pretty used to it." "That harsh, huh?" I asked. She nodded. "He mostly does that when my mom's not around, so she won't be there to stop him." I snorted. "Spells coward to me," I said. I got her under the covers. "Goodnight, Tyler." "Goodnight Skyler. And thank you. For everything." "I'm feeling generous today, I guess," I said. "Now go to sleep. You'll heal better if you sleep." I had a lot of lessons from Mrs. Everdeen. "Yes, doctor," she said sarcastically. "But I need my pjs." I smiled. "I like you," I said. "We might be really good friends." I was walking out when Nick walked in. I had a feeling he purposely came in late to let us talk. "Where do I put this?" he said holding up the small duffel bag. "You can put it in the closet," I said. I walked out and went into the living room to wait for Nick. He came down a minute later. I stood up. "Thanks for letting us talk," I said. "That obvious?" he said, smiling. "Nobody takes that long to get a bag of clothes," I said. "Why'd you do it?" "Maybe you'll make great friends with her," he said. I could sense some negativity in his voice. "Jealous?" I teased. "Maybe," he admitted. "The famous Nick is jealous?" I said, trying and failing to lighten up the mood. "It's just that she's a whole lot like you," he started. "You have the same sense of humor, same style, you like to do the same things, she even likes songs from hundreds of years ago just like you, she can play guitar just like you, she can plat piano, she can dance, and she even has a great singing voice. She's more suited to be your best friend than I am." He looked down and fiddled with the chain on his neck. I gave him that chain, and I have one just like it that he gave me. He said the next part more quietly. "She's more like you than I'll ever be. She's practically you in another body. I'd be proud to call you my best friend. Being your best friend is a huge honor." "First of all, Nick," I said, "I know it's an honor, and it's an honor that you have." He still wouldn't look up. "Look at me, Nick," I said. He looked up. "I know she's a lot like me, okay? But I don't want my best friend to be just like me. I want my best friend to be just like you, Nick. You know, being your best friend is an honor, too." His gaze shifted back to his necklace. He fiddled with it again. I pulled on mine. "Look at this, Nick," I said. He looked at my necklace, then back at his own, then back to mine again. "What is this?" I asked him. "A necklace," he said matter-of-factly. "Duh." "And what's that?" I said, taking hold of his necklace. "A necklace," he said again. "Shut up," I said, smiling. "I'm not stupid." "I never said you were," he said back. "You were thinking it," I said back. "Ah. Well played," he said. "What about the necklaces?" "They're proof that you are my best friend. No one else, okay?" He nodded. "Come here, Nick," I said, holding my arms out. He stepped into the hug, and we stayed like that for a couple minutes. "I love you," I said. "I love you, too," he said back. "Always." "Wait a minute," I said. I pulled back quickly and looked at him suspiciously. "How did you know all those things about Tyler?" I asked. "Uh..." he stammered. I could see him blushing madly. "I gotta go. Goodnight!" He turned to bolt out the door, but I caught his arm. I grinned wickedly. "Stalker," I teased. I leaned in and whispered, "Does the famous Finnick Odair Jr. have a crush?" He pulled back. "Pffft. No," he made a miserable attempt at scoffing. I stared at him hard. "Maybe," he said. I grinned at him slyly. "Don't worry, Nick," I reassured. "Your secret's safe with me." "Thanks, Sky," he said, hugging me. "You really are my best friend." "I have been since over two years ago," I said. "You're realizing that now?" "Shut up. I'm trying to be sweet," he said. I laughed. "I promise not to tell anybody about this. You trust me, right?" "Well," he said, "You are a very, very convincing liar." "True," I said. "But," he interjected, "you take your promises very seriously. So I trust you." I kissed him on the cheek and hugged him. He hugged back with a squeeze. "Goodnight, Sky," he said softly, kissing the top of my head. "Thank you." "Goodnight, Nick." I pulled back and walked him to the front door. I opened the door. "Now get out of my house." "See you tomorrow?" he asked hopefully. "I better," I said. I closed the door as he started walking away. I smiled secretly. "Your secret's safe with me, Nick," I murmured while walking to my room to set up the floor for me to sleep in. That turned out to be longer than I thought it would be. I can't promie you I would update chapters as long as this, but if it's too long, let me know by reviewing on PM me. This is my second story ever. I won't update again until I get a certain number of reviews telling me to go on. Review please. :) Also, I might do a Q&A for my characters, but only if you submit questions. Bye. :)
