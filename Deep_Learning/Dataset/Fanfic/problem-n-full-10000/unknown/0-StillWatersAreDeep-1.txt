something which wouldn't be sold at a place like the Hog's Head. So, Snape had to have gone to get something which was most likely illegal in Britain. But, this could wait until later, now he just wanted to know what the prophesy said. "It said, 'The one with the power to assure our Lord's reign approaches ... born to those who have thrice stood with him, born as the seventh month dies ... and our Lord will make him his equal'" Severus repeated the part of the prophesy he had heard word for word to his Lord. "Nothing more?" Riddle asked, hoping that it may have said how his reign would be secured. "I believe that there was more," the Potions master admitted. "But," he added before he could be interrupted, "I was unable to hear it as the voice of the Seer was drowned out by Aberforth's loud yell. I, of course, tried to find out the rest but, unfortunately, the Seer had been alone in the room, so no one knows if anything else had been said or what it was." "How very unfortunate," Riddle said in a calm, calculating voice. "So, who else knows of this prophesy?" Lord Slytherin asked after some moments of silence. "Besides you, my Lord, and myself, only the Seer and Albus Dumbledore are aware of the prophesy's existence," Severus answered the question. "And why does the old fool know about it?" Tom questioned, angered that of all the people the meddlesome headmaster of Hogwarts knew about it. Tom Riddle had never liked Albus Dumbledore because the old man had never treated him with the respect he deserved during his Hogwarts years, simply because Tom, while being part of the royal family, was still a half-blood which made him nothing more than a commoner in the eyes of the pure-blood traditionalist. He would love to get him replaced as the headmaster of Hogwarts but with Dumbledore being the defeater of Gellert Grindelwald, he was still too popular to easily sack. So, Riddle had no other choice right now than to wait until the old man would either resign or die. "Headmaster Dumbledore entered the room while I was trying to get the second half of the prophesy out of the Seer. Apparently the woman had been waiting for him to arrive because they had a job interview for the Divinations post scheduled," Severus explained Dumbledore's knowledge about the prophesy's existence. And because he knew that there was no love lost between Hogwarts' headmaster and Lord Slytherin, he added, "Though, Dumbledore doesn't know what the prophesy is about." Riddle only nodded his head in response to the words. "You did good, Severus, in reporting the prophesy to me," Lord Slytherin praised. "You can go now," he then dismissed his Potions master, wanting to be alone to contemplate what he would do with the new knowledge. While Severus was unable to bring me the whole prophesy, the part he heard is at least informative enough to point me in the right direction, Tom thought after Severus closed the study's ebony door behind him. Especially the last sentences gave Lord Slytherin many details about the second person the prophesy was referring to. So, the person to assure my reign will be born at the end of July, most likely in this year, Lord Slytherin thought. Also, this person will obviously be male. A male carrier even, or otherwise I wouldn't be able to marry him and thus make him my equal as the prophesy suggests, he deciphered from the last part of the prophesy. At least not many male carries are born, so that will considerably cut down the number of probable candidates, Tom thought with a smirk, getting up from his chair; it was time to finally retire for the day. It is a shame that prophesies aren't automatically recorded* when they're made, Lord Slytherin thought as he closed and locked his study's door to walk to the master bedroom of Slytherin Manor on the third floor. Lord Slytherin of course was right with his assumption that the male being a carrier would severely cut down the possible persons the prophesy could refer to. Only about one out of fifty wizards had the ability to get pregnant. Thus, a male carrier―or a Foreas* to use the technical term―was only born every one or two years in Britain. And in nineteen-eighty only one boy would turn out to be a Foreas. -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-Verbuar―Blinded-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Maybe Severus would never have told Tom Riddle about the prophesy if he had known the second half of it. Or maybe he would have done his best to make sure that the other path the prophesy proposed would have been followed instead of the path to destruction we unknowingly followed. But, as Fate had wanted it, on this snowy evening in February the path my life would take was already decided to be the path of destruction instead of the path of happiness it also offered. And so, the story of my life set out to end in a tragedy... -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-Verbuar―Blinded-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- Verbuar: Blinded in Albanian according to Google Translator. Northallerton: As Great and Little Hangleton don't exist in reality, I searched for a real town which like Little Hangleton was located in the North of England and was about 200 miles away from London. I found Northallerton, which is about 230 miles away from London and located in the North of England. It also has a Country club nearby. So, it would be a good location for Slytherin's manor. No recorded prophesies: In my AU a Prophesy room doesn't exist in the Ministry, so Tom can't find out the second half of the prophesy from the record which exists in canon. Foreas: Greek for bearer/carrier according to Google Translator, though there it is actually written as Foréas. -~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-Verbuar―Blinded-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~- AN: Thank you for taking the time to read the prologue. Should I continue writing, or are the story warnings too much for you?
