1 November 2006: Unsent letter to Draco Malfoy Draco Nearly one hundred addendums in a single month… I vow to finish this journey for you. I may not survive, but I will set you free in the end. The dark is rising, clouding my brain and making it difficult to write...to breathe...to live… But my love for you is strong, so strong. I must… . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 November 2006: Travel Log #87 St. Marinov Magical Hospital, Moscow, Russia I am such an idiot. I've been admitted to the Wizarding hospital here in Moscow. Yury found me the day before last nearly comatose in bed. Severely dehydrated and exhausted, I'd been unable to answer the phone or get in touch with the front desk for a few days to pay my room fees. They'd sent up the bellhop to check on me. I feel horrible for scaring him as I did, but he saved my life. After sending word to Kingsley and Ron, I also finally replied to Harry's letters too. I need to floo my mum and dad when I'm finally released because apparently they've been worried too. In all the time I've spent fretting over my damn addendum drafts, I forgot about myself and how losing myself would affect those around me. I'm going to try and be better. I should go home to London, but I'll stay until the holidays like I'd planned. It can't get much worse than this. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 November 2006: Travel Log #90 Red Square, Moscow, Russia I'm sitting here people watching in the Red Square. It's cold, far colder than I need to be subjecting myself to right now. The Healers told me to rest, relax, and make sure I eat and get enough fluids. I'm trying. Honestly, I am. My parents will be arriving on the 4th of December so I just have to keep myself together until then. I asked Yury what else there was to do in Russia this time of the year and he gave me a few suggestions. I might try them out, but I also might just try and get myself put back into some sort of order. I don't know who I am anymore, and I don't like it. Not one bit. What do you do when the person that made you whole leaves you behind? Where do I start? I need guidance. I'll find myself eventually. I never give up. It's getting late and I still have to find a quiet restaurant to eat. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 December 2006: Unsent letter to Draco Malfoy Happy anniversary… . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 December 2006: Unsent letter to Ron Weasley Ron, I hope you understand why I'm staying away again this year. It's just too hard being around your huge, loving family. I want a family like that… one of my own… It's going to be hard enough coming back and re-immersing myself in regular life. It's going to kill me being in Draco's presence every single day at work trying to solve that new case. How am I going to stand knowing he's happy? That he has the family he always wanted? When is it going to be my turn? What do I have to do to get my happy ending? Run to the edge of the universe? Because I would. I would do anything to be happy again. I'm going to need you, Ron. I know I don't usually ask for help, but I am now. I need your help, Ron. Please.

My parents and I will be celebrating the New Year at St. Basil's Cathedral tonight, and then tomorrow they fly back to Sydney while I apparate home to London. It's hard to believe that this time last year, I was packing my bags for Sydney. I never knew this journey would turn into such a huge part of my life, but here I am. Mum and dad think I am going to run myself into the ground, and they're probably right. I can't stop now, though. I just finished Addendum Draft #300 today which is a feat I never thought I'd achieve. In all honesty, I expected to give up before reaching one hundred. We'll see how many more I need to do before it's complete. Maybe, if the Minister allows it, I can do a bit more traveling after this new case and finish up before the next year rolls around. I'm also hoping this next year brings less teardrops and more happiness. Fingers crossed. Happy New Year.
