Then everything turned black. Rhode woke to screams. Sumerian from a PDF I found online Sumerian/Mesopotamian mythology taken from Wikipedia Translations: Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa! Ati Me Peta Babka.

I got this little plot bunny when I first started to play Bloodborne and it wouldn't. Fucking. Go. So, I wrote the first chapter. I may continue it in the future but I don't know. I started it like 1 or 1.5 years ago, and just finished it today/yesterday. I can't think of a good title for this fic so it's Untitled until I can think of a good one. This was my first attempt into the more adult-y, darker kind of writing and I have no idea how it turned out. So, tell me what you think if you wish. If you get inspired by this and what to write a fic based on this, please to tell me so I can pop a mention below! Ja ne! Deanna Saber
