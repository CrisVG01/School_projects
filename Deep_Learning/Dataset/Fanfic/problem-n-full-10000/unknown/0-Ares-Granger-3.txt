back to find the zipper of the dress. He wanted to see that body he'd felt through her clothes so many times before when he'd been lifting her up to repair the school. He found the zipper but the angle was wrong and he couldn't get it down. Hermione got off the bed and turned around so he could release her from the dress. Draco quickly unzipped her and leaned back to watch her slide her sexy red dress down over some very nice hips. Hermione Granger had a surprising hourglass figure. Draco was in awe. "Wow," he breathed, gazing at the nearly nude witch's rather impressive breasts which were heaving as she tried to get her breath back from their kisses. "You're stunning," he told her. She smiled and slipped her heels off before straddling him again, "You have the body of a god," she whispered to him, her fingers moving over his defined torso. Draco leaned in and kissed her, pulling her down onto the bed. Without a doubt, this was going to be the best night of his life. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% The next morning Hermione woke to Draco's hand cupping her breast. Their clothes were strewn throughout her bedroom. She leaned into his embrace and smiled. This was nice. "You're so sexy," he mumbled, keeping his eyes closed. Hermione smiled and turned her head to look at him behind her, "Do you need a hangover potion?" "No," he answered. "You?" "I'm fine," she kissed his shoulder, "last night was phenomenal." Draco grinned and opened his eyes, "It really was. You're incredible." Hermione turned to face him and kissed him on the lips, "Draco do you want breakfast?" "I would rather have you," he said, making Hermione giggle as he rolled so that she was underneath him, "Shag, shower, shag, and then we eat." "That sounds good to me," she smiled, her hands roaming his torso before their mouths met again. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Blaise woke on the living room sofa to someone knocking on the door to his flat. He got up, groaning at the nausea that came over him when he did. Rubbing his head he walked to the door and opened it, "Don't you have a key?" He asked a very chipper Draco Malfoy. "Yes but Hermione and I weren't sure if you were awake yet," he said. "She's making breakfast right now and we figured you and Ginny were probably hungry." "Sure," Blaise rubbed his eyes, "how long do we have?" "We'll give you twenty minutes," Draco said. "Did you have fun?" "We danced, we snogged, we talked. It was fun," Blaise nodded. "I'll take the hangover potion and shower. We'll see you downstairs." "Great," Draco smiled. "My night was bloody brilliant, by the way," he winked before heading back toward Hermione's flat. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Hermione leaned back into his embrace when he came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her, "Were they awake?" "I woke Blaise up but didn't see Red. Seems like he slept on the couch and gave her his bed," Draco answered, leaning down to kiss the side of her neck, "Breakfast smells good." "No one can resist the powers of French toast," Hermione grinned. "My dad swore my mum's French toast was the perfect hangover food." "Do you need me to do anything?" While Draco wasn't about to be a chef, he had learned how to cook the muggle way and he could do things in the kitchen without magic. Despite how his parents had raised him, he'd become quite self-sufficient that summer. Hermione smiled, "Get out the juice? And plates?" Draco released her and did as she asked. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Blaise and Ginny arrived just in time. Draco got out everything Hermione requested and helped her plate breakfast before they all sat down to eat, "So how was your night?" Ginny asked Hermione. She smiled at Draco but didn't say a word. He swallowed his first bite of food, "Hermione this is delicious." "Thank you Draco," she said before addressing the redhead, "I don't kiss and tell Ginny." "Oh come on," Ginny pouted. "Nope," Hermione shook her head. "I am very pleased with my choice of lover and have no regrets and that's all you'll get." Ginny looked at Malfoy, "How about you?" "Best night of my life," he answered. Hermione's smile grew at that and Draco knew he'd said the right thing. Hermione looked at Ginny, "So how did you and Blaise get on without us?" "Just fine," Ginny said, frowning at the lack of details. "Are you sure you don't want to gush?" "Positive," Hermione said. "Draco's ego is big enough." Blaise laughed while Draco looked smug for the rest of breakfast. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Ginny returned to the Burrow after breakfast and Hermione banished Blaise from her apartment so that she could have some privacy with Draco. "So how was your night?" Draco asked her, sitting down on the sofa. "Pretty incredible," Hermione sat on his lap. "Although this morning was a little better. You're a fast learner." "Six months ago I thought I'd die a virgin," Draco confessed. "Let's just say I'm highly appreciative of not being dead and getting a chance with such a beautiful woman." Hermione smiled and offered her own confession, "I had the same thoughts when Bellatrix was torturing me. That was it. I'd die there, at her hands, a virgin and not having done so many things that I wanted to do." "I will happily do loads of those things with you," Draco grinned. Hermione laughed, "That doesn't surprise me at all." "I can be a generous person," he smirked. "I'm not stupid Draco," Hermione deadpanned. "I've come to know you quite well these past few weeks and generous is not the first descriptor to come to mind." "I can be generous to the people that matter to me," Draco countered. "You'll see." Hermione kissed him. She was greatly looking forward to the rest of the summer and getting to know Draco even more.
