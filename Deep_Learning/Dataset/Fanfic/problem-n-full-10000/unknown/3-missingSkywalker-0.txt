a good thing or a bad thing. I decide to figure out later and look at Piper's tray. Piper's consists of chocolate cake, an apple, and a veggie burger. Piper quickly drags me to an open table on the right side; she smiles innocently at me when I sit down. My arm has a light pink hand print from Piper dragging me across the Cafeteria. I roll my eyes at her and hide my small smile. Piper and I are sitting in between a boy named Dylan who had perfect white teeth and a snobby look, and a beautiful girl named Silena (Piper's older sister) that had perfect white teeth, light pink full lips, bright blue eyes, and black hair plus Charles a fit, muscular boy with dark brown skin, perfect teeth, and dark brown coffee-colored eyes that had specks of orange and yellow on Silena's right. "Silena!" Piper nearly shouts as she gets up and squeezes her sister to death. Silena laughs a beautiful high laugh as Piper hugs her. "Love you too, Pipes!" Says Silena to Piper. "I missed you!" Said Piper. "It has been lonely since you left; all I had was Lacey and Michael. Plus Drew was the worst." Silena laughed. "It couldn't have been that-" Piper sent her a death glare. "Okay, okay, so it was that bad. By the way, this is my boyfriend, Charles, but everyone calls him Beck-" "Yo, Three, over here!" Yelled someone from across the room. I looked over my shoulder to see Three talking to Thalia. I was almost jealous if it wasn't for the fact they acted like siblings. Thalia grinned and walked over to my table, dragging Three along. "Hey, I'm Thalia!" Said Thalia. "Duh!" Shouted Octavian. Thalia glared at him intently and touched the hilt of her sword. "As I was saying, everyone's trial results have been evaluated from when you are ten, and this year, no one will be sent to work in the government camps. You will be tested tomorrow by Three." Piper and I shared a look. Tested for what? Could they be searching for Divergents? 'I hope not.' I thought. I wondered if I was the only Divergent in the room. Piper seemed like a likely candidate; she was perfect for Amity or Dauntless. Thalia, Silena, Charles, and Three all seemed like they were Divergents too. My mother, Malcolm, and Katie mostly likely were Divergents too. I missed my mother and our chats on architecture. She would hug me and tell me stories. Stories of long ago, stories of a place called Greece and their Gods, the stories have always fascinated me. For some reason, I used to believe that my- "Beth." Said Piper sternly. Piper gave me a what-the-heck-are-you-doing? Look, just like Malcolm. My stomach churned at the thought of him; I always thought he was perfect for our birth faction, but now I'm not so sure. I quickly force thoughts of Malcolm away as I tune in the conversion. "Yes, Piper?" I asked. Piper grinned and rolled her eyes. "Thalia and Three invited us to come with them to have fun." Piper said. I looked over to Thalia and Three; Thalia gave off as dangerous and fun, while Percy gave off mysterious and laid-back. No to mention, I wouldn't mind getting to know Three better. "Sure, I'm in." VvV I had butterflies in my stomach as I watched the elevator move up floors. I don't recall ever being in one before and definitely never by cute boys like Three or Luke. Thalia, Luke, Three, Charles, Silena, Clarisse, Piper, Dylan, and I all were together in this elevator. Of course, out of those people, I end up Mr. Three here. Three is currently chatting with Charles and Silena who have been dubbed 'Cutest Couple Ever', Thalia and Luke are laughing together, and Piper had a Kill-me-now face on as Dylan chats with her. I smirk. Poop Piper. I stop and think; what would my family do if they saw me now? It hasn't been a day, and yet I feel at home and have changed so much. I never had felt like this before. My parents probably would barely recognize me now. I wonder how much I would change before I saw them again. I watch as the floor numbers go up and waited. Things are looking up; now if I could just get to know Three better. ################################################################# Edited as of 08/30/16. Hey, guys, I'm back! ;P -MissingSkywalker ################################################################# Sofia Nightshade knew a when a person was hiding a huge secret. She knew the moment she met Three that he was hiding something. She knew it when she met Silena, Luke, and Tori. She also knew that Annabeth was hiding something. Something big. They all were, and as an Erudite, it was her job to get to the bottom of this. After all, they ll had something to hide. The last person who had something to hide was Sally Jackson. She was found guilty of high treason against all the factions. Her son was among the dead and as is those who tried to help her. The Jedi, the pirates, the Shadowhunters, superheroes, the Divergents, and their other allies shall regret the day they crossed the line of treason. For now, they were safe. But for how long? How long could they hid? How long can they stand it? Sofia has the patience to wait, but do they? She paused in her thinking to stare down at the Dauntless compound. Soon, so soon, they would be exposed. Then the world will be safe. Inside the compound, Annabeth felt a chill down her spine. Something was terribly wrong, and it would only lead to Chaos. Unless they stood up and fought. There was a dangerous glint in her eyes as if something had awoken in her. Perhaps she had found the skills she never knew she had. Maybe it was a missing part of her abilities or someone locked it away.
