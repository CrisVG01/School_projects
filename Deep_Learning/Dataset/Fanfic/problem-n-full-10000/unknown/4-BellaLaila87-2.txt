much longer. Elizabeth was shocked, "You concider...a...killer...after someone...who could easily kill someone...easy?" she asked incrediously. I looked at her and laughed. she looked back at me shocked that I was laughing at her I assume, "Ma'm I was taught to fight a 500 pound man. I was taught to know that you are not wearing any make up bt lip gloss and a bit of cream colored eyeshadow and haven't yet to brush your teeth" she covered her mouth, I smiled "and that you were just inside the kitchen making eggs and toast with jelly, grape by the way. Only for Alice because Emmet and Edward are not home. Oh and orange juice and DunkenDonut's coffee." If she wasn't shocked before she was shocked now, "How did you-" I cut her off before she could say anything else, "I was trained to." carisle was fighting a smile. Esme the same. They were impressed. "Now, Mrs. Masen, if there is anything else that you would like to ask please do." Carisle said "Just one." She said as she turned to look at Carisle. "What is that?" He asked Then she looked at me and hugged me. Ah more hugging. When she pulled away, "Would you all like to come in for brunch?" Esme smiled. Carisle lightly laughed. I suppressed to roll my eyes. But I didn't smile I just nodded. She noticed my stiffness. "Well good. As you all already no Emmet and Edward aren't home at the moment but they should be coming home in a few minutes, now if you would follow me." she walked towards the house pulling my hand along, so that I would follow her. this was going to be long mission. And a lot of hugging. **************************************************************** EPOV Em and I went out to the grocery store to get some stuff for mom to make her special honey. Our Aunt and Uncle were suppose to come today. We never saw any pictures of them. Mom said that once Esme and her turned 18 they went separte ways. They still taalked but they never kept contact. granpa and granma didn't like it that they never kept contact. Frankly we only just found out that we have an Aunt and Uncle and cousin at all. They were moving next door to us. Mom wasn't sure if they had a child or not. I was hoping so. It would be fun to get to know a little kid. There real cute. Tanya wasn't much into kids. It sucks honestly. "So? What do you think they will be like?" Emmet asked me. "I dida no." I said. I was still sleepy. "Well, were about to find out." He said as we pulled into the driveway. We walked into the house with the groceries. Emmet shouted into the house, "MOM WE ARE HOME!" We set the stuff down on the counter. Alice was giggling then we turned around. And oh my god what was behind us. Alice was sitting next tall blonde man and to his right was a woman that looked like mom but she had honey blonde hair next to her was mom, then next to her was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen before. She had pale pale skin and big brown chocolate eyes and long mahogany colored hair that came to the middle of her back. My mouth was opened. Alice got up and pushed my mouth closed, then she turned around and stood next to me. "Edward Emmet, this is Carisle, Esme and Isabella." She said. Carisle stood up, and he was the same height as Emmet. Which was saying something, he spoke, "It is nice to meet you both." He stuck out his hand, Emmet ignored it and huggged him, I did the same to be polite. Isabella looked sort of irrated by the hugging thing. Esme came up next behind Carisle, she was smaller but not that far. She was mom's height. She hugged us gingerly, 'It is nice to meet you both." She said. There was double meaning in the words somehow. Isabella was next, Emmet lifted her offf the ground. "It's nice to meet you cous." She didn't seem very fazed from the hug. Like she was anticipating it. She went to me next, I pulled her into a more gentle hug, "It is really nice to meet you Isabella." I said when I pulled away. She looked at me and just nodded. Okay... "Well, if you don't mind Elizabeth, I think that it is time for us to go and unpack." Carisle said. My mom shook her head, "Please call me Liz." carisle laughed, "Alright Liz." Esme smiled. "Well we will come by for lunch alright Lizzy.?" Mom laughed and said, "Yes of course." She hugged all of them, but she hugged Isabella last and looked at her long and hard, with a concerned face. Isabella shook her head and whispered something to my mom, which made her laugh. She hugged her. Isabella stiffened again from another hug. But she patted my mom's back. As they left Em and I looked at each other. For once I knew we were thinking the same thing. Emmet was the first one to ask. "So mom, what's up with Isabella?"he asked. My mother stiffened before she turned around. "What do you mean?" She asked this warily. "I mean, why is she so nervous with the whole hugging thing." Mom visibly relaxed, "Well Isabella isn't really Carisle and Esme's daughter." All of us, including Alicce said, "WHAT?" She laughed at our reaction, "Yes that is right. Isabella's real parents...died. And Carisle and Esme adopted her when she was thirteen." she said solemly. We all were silent. Alice was the one who spoke, "Poor Isabella." she whispered, "When did her parents die?" My mom looked down and stopped cooking, "I don't know." We all were silent. This was going to be a long week. A/N: so? how bout it? any good? please review
