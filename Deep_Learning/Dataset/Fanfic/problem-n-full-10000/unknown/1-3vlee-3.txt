"Okay guys. (1) How bad? (2) How mad is she?" All at the same time; "Pretty pissed." "Oh double shit. Well let's get this over & done with. Send her in." Haymitch goes & gets Camille who marches in looks at her daughter; "Katniss Elizabeth, what on earth were you thinking?" "What I always do Mom, protect the family. If something happened to Cato, both families Gale's & ours would've gotten hit. And hit hard." "I don't know whether to be mad at you or Gale at this point?" Katniss "Me Mom. My choice & I swore Gale to secrecy until we got Cato home. Mom Cato has to finish the tour or, Snow's going to be pissed. There's only one left then Caesar can use the DVDs that I did for my part of the interviews Cato can still do his in person with Caesar & make himself the good guy. That takes care all requirements & I can go home & be the freak show outcast there. Get Cato to finish the tour. He gets to be the hero he's always wanted to be. No 12 hogging "his" spot light. It makes sense. I'm tired Mom. So damn tired. He's at the willow mom." "Who Katniss?" "Dad. He's at the willow said you know what it means." Katniss falls asleep as Camille tears up. The doctor has the room ready, where the staff wheel Katniss in. On its door there is a sign 'NO Roses allowed.' Upon hearing the news Gale takes a train to District-2 to fulfill his promise to Katniss. Gale calls Haymitch tells him his promise which Haymitch told him he found the three DVDs. Gale said there's more, a lot more. Upon arrival Haymitch meets Gale at the train station. "How's she doing Haymitch? Why the one way ticket?" "She woke up for a few but there were three clots near her brain from the games. She's hanging in there. Still fighting all the way. I'll let Cato explain the one way ticket." Haymitch then takes him to Cato at the hospital. "Although you don't deserve her time of day, I am fulfilling a promise of OUR Victor, Katniss Everdeen. The copy you have is DVD number 3. Here are all the originals. I made a promise to deliver all of them directly into YOUR hands Cato. " "Thank you, Gale." Cato outstretched his hand in a token of peace & friendship. Gale turned it away saying; "You have no idea what she suffered for you & because of you. Katniss thought it was atonement for failing me in getting my father out of the mine when she was only 11. Catnip never forgave herself for my dad. Yet she's done more for us than we can ever repay her for. I could only stand by & give minimal help because she thought she failed her best friend. YOU have NO CLUE what that's like. The pain she was in would drop most men to their knees but not Katniss." "Want to help me get the ones who were doing this to her?" "Hell FUCKIN' YES! Duh. (while giving Cato a no shit Sherlock look) What you got 2?" " Mr. Everdeen show Gale the arrest warrants please. Gale my friend, how would you like to serve these on them? For Katniss Everdeen, your best friend." Gale smiling "With Pleasure. Now give me your hand 2." Has they both shake on it. Johnathan Everdeen tells Gale the plan since he will be flying back with them. Hospital room district two (3days later) I n a hospital room in district two Katniss wakes up again to bright light. This time members of Cato's Family are there. Camille is asleep on a cot nearby while Johnathan sleeps in a chair. The uncles along with Cain Adams are in route back from 12 with the Mellarks, in irons after dropping Gale off. Amanda Adams is the first to notice; "Hi there. I'm Cato's mother, Amanda Adams. Better wake up your mother & grandfather." Katniss looks at the two in question amazed; "Holy sh.., they're in the same room, together. Damn I'm good. Mrs. Adams allow me. Mom, Grandpa when do I get to eat? " Both of them eyes shot open as Johnathan said . "Well welcome back. You were right about the tour. Sent Cato to One yesterday. He's there making his speech now. Oh & the President hopes you make a speedy recovery." "Give Cato a buzz Grandpa." Johnathan Everdeen called Cato who in the middle of the speech politely excuses himself when Brutus gave him the phone & got a surprise when Katniss said; "Cato deliver the damn thing like you got the pair that YOU claim to have. For Pete sakes, damn it. It's dull as dirty dishwater here!" Brutus gets on then; "Hey kiddo? How you feeling?" He then started laughing when Katniss replied; " Well I know I don't want to have booze ever if the headaches are like this. The hangovers suck. Maybe I should get a professional opinion. Is Haymitch there with you?" Cato breaking away from the speech announced; "We got her back folks. The Girl on fire is back, SHE'S up! Then finished his speech." The crowd roared as it applauded their response. Hospital room District Two (2 days later)-fallout. Remember no good deed goes unpunished. Well it applied in this case for Katniss big time. Besides the hair loss, she lost most feeling in her right heel due to slight nerve damage & some mobility in her right hand. Katniss but her vision is already returning to normal & PT (Katniss calls it physical torture) will help gain most if not all mobility back. Yet the doctor wants her to stay in district two for the rounds of torture until they can determine if feeling will return to the heel or, if it's permanently damage. ************************************************** **************************** ******7/24/2014 I decided to redo.
