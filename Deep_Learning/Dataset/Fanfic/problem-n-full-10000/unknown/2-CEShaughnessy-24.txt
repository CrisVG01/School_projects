well as making sure everything was closed up tight against the weather. "Mum?" Pervinca's voice was small as she tugged on her mother's apron. "Is that true? Are we going to have another Fell Winter?" "Oh, don't worry, child. We may well receive a big storm but I very much doubt we're going to have another winter like that one." She frowned at Pimpernel, who simply shrugged as if to say her mother knew it was the truth. The weather conditions over the last few weeks had proven to be very erratic and even Da had made several comments about having a harsh winter. "Come, children. Let's get supper started before everyone comes in. I have a great deal to accomplish before bedtime and I'll need all the help I can get." In the barn, Paladin worked with two of the hired hobbits, Tomias Hornblower and Togo Burrows, rushing about to get everything secured for what might prove to be a long and restless night. As if that wasn't enough, Orangeblossom was due to freshen any day now and Paladin hoped it would be before they left for the journey to Brandy Hall. While he knew the farmhands were quite capable of handling things he preferred to be present in case there were any problems. "Hurry up lads, that wind is picking up more every minute and I want everyone to get inside where it's warm the minute the chores are finished." Paladin made another circuit around the barn, checking to see that all the stock had been fed and plenty of fresh hay had been put down. Tomias nodded and trotted off to finish his work. All around them, hobbits scurried about, anxious to be done with their tasks and inside sipping a hot cup of tea and enjoying a pipe filled with good Longbottom leaf. _______________________________________________________________________________ Pippin shrieked in delight at Merry's idea, and clapped his hands. "I want to do it, Merry!" He was practically dancing a jig around his older cousin in his delight with the scheme. "We have to talk your parents into it first, you know." "But it's ForeYule and that ought to be all right. And then Frodo can come to the Hall with us for AfterYule!" Pippin tilted his head in thought. "Or perhaps we can persuade everyone to come to Bag End instead!" "Now, what a surprise that would be." Merry sighed. "But it might not work. The best solution would be for everyone to simply come with us to Bag End to celebrate." "YES! Cousin Frodo would be thrilled!" "Shh! They'll hear," Merry cautioned. "What are you giggling about, Pippin?" Pervinca studied her little brother suspiciously as she rounded the corner and entered the parlour. Merry said nothing and turned away to place another log on the fire. "You lads had best fetch in some more wood from the shed," Pimpernel told them as she hurried past, her arms full of blankets. "The night will be very cold and we'll need to keep the fires burning. Come now, everyone must shake a leg and help out!" "Pervinca, come back and help us get everything that we've brought from the cellar into the kitchen," Eglantine called. "I want to get the doors closed up tight the moment your father gets in." More scurrying about, accompanied by giggles and some pushing and pulling amongst the younger ones. Eglantine took a moment away from her work to enjoy the sight of her children gathered around all safe and sound. The youngsters seemed to find joy in everything they did, even when things were serious. She smiled and resumed her work with a shake of her head. BAG END HOBBITON The wind continued to pick up even more during the night and now it was snowing. The sudden smack of a tree branch or perhaps something else against the window of his room had stirred him from his slumber. Frodo pulled the blankets up to his chin and settled back into the warmth, trying to recapture the lovely dream he'd been having. Bilbo was back and everyone was together for Yule. Frodo was much younger and filled with the wonder of the celebration as only a child can be. Gaily decorated tables groaned with bounty, the scent of rich foods filling the air of the smial. He sniffed the air in delighted anticipation. The holly and mistletoe were hung and the warm fire caused beads of sweat to form on his brow, but he didn't mind. The music had begun, and it was soft and low, sweet with the warmth of a summer's sun. The voices of his family murmured around him and there, in the corner of the parlour in his favourite chair, sat Bilbo, regarding them all with a customary twinkle in his eyes. It was perfect, all of it, and he wished to settle back into his dream and remain there. Soon, he was asleep again. The insistent rapping at the front door forced him from his warm bed at last. Frodo peered out a window at the blowing snow and rubbed at his bleary eyes. He glanced at the clock on the mantle. Midnight. Who would be fool enough to come calling this late, and in the middle of a blizzard, no less? Frodo pulled the round, green door open; it was difficult in the screaming wind, but at last he managed. On the doorstep huddled a small, shivering form wrapped tightly in a cloak. "Whatever are you doing here?" Frodo cried, his alarm increasing when he realised who it was and pulled him inside. "Get in here, it's freezing out there! What, surely you're not alone?" Pippin giggled into his mittened hands. "Of course not!" He gestured over his shoulder at the glistening world beyond Bag End. "Look at what I've done!" Frodo stared where his little cousin pointed, his eyes widening at the sight. "Oh, Pippin," he breathed and knelt to embrace the child. "What have you done?"
