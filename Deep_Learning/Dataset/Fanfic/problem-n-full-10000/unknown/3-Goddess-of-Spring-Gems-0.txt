with them? To use as a table? "Missed us!" I called out, testing the sword. It wasn't so hot anymore. "No I didn't!" Minos yelled. I looked at everyone else. Couldn't they see the shade? It was then I saw that no one else was there. "Take that!" He whipped out a staff at tried to hit us with it. Of course, my first reaction was to yell and throw the sword at him, effectively shutting him up. "Finally. Some peace and silence. Now can you explain what's going on?" I asked my two friends, picking the sword up. "Umm..." Zagreus trailed off. "I mean, the vaporization of Minos? Him reforming? Most of all, him being supposedly dead ?" I asked, my voice rising and I glared at them. "Your glare is just as efficient as Zagreus'." Nicole said. "Deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out." She demonstrated, as if I didn't know how to breath. "I know how to breath!" I yelled, earning weird glances from people near us, as we went to the tables, and met up with the rest of our class. "Anyways, go on." I added, taking my food out. "Where were you?" Father walked up behind us. "Outdise. I mean outside." I was so annoyed, I mispronounced the word. "She figured out, didn't she?" Hades asked Zagreus, sitting down. "Kind of, but not really." Nicole said. "Speaking of that, why did you come here? To get exposed?" Dad frowned. "If thunderhead found out..." "Who's thunderhead?" I asked. Nicole and Zagreus stifled laughs. "My younger brother. Youngest actually." Father said, looking upwards. "Mom called him that too." "Can you explain what happened?" I asked him. "What?" He asked me. He actually did look confused, so I asked Nicole and Zagreus. "What happened?" I asked again. "What do you mean?" Zagreus asked, attaining the same look of confusion that my father had just used to me. "I think she means what happened when we were at the garden." Nicole said, snapping her fingers. I felt my memory start to fuzz over and, wait. What happened? I was pretty sure that Nicole had pulled Zagreus over to the garden to show him something about black flowers and had stayed there for a few minutes... "Oh, right! We were interrupted by your dad, when he asked us where you were." Zagreus said. I felt a small tugging at the back of my mind, as if that hadn't been the truth. But how did I know that? 'Remember what you learned, my dear.' A calm and sweet voice told me. It was so calm that it felt sick. 'Remember how to get rid of Mist.' Frowning, I tried out the instructions I remembered from my dream. ' Clear your thoughts, take a deep breath and blink three times. All of a sudden, my mind cleared. They never went to the garden. This shade guy -Minos- had tried killing us and all that. Why did they lie? Watching them smile and laugh about gardens being the last place that dad would usually go to, I doubted that it was to hurt me. But what had they used on me? It felt as if this was a giant illusion. Father seemed to notice me zoning out. "What's wrong?" He asked. "I know that they're lying." "About what?" My dad stared at me weirdly and snapped his fingers, much like Nicole had done. All of a sudden, my thoughts changed. Nicole and Zagreus had been at the garden when Minos attacked, and in the throne room, they had left for a while. My thoughts were all jumbled. Did Nicole and Zagreus know what was happening? Wait. What was happening? They weren't there when I killed Minos. I think. A wave of nausea overwhelmed me and once my head cleared, I remembered what happened with Minos. "What are you doing after school?" Zagreus asked me once dad left. "To the ice-cream shop." I said. "Cool! We're also going there!" Nicole said. "Do you know Minos?" I asked them. "You mean the greek king Minos?" Nicole asked, frowning. "It really wasn't fair to make people get eaten by the Minotaur." "And then become a judge of the dead once he died." Zagreus added. "He tried to attack me." I said. "He did what?!" The two of them asked, quietly. "He snuck up on me today. And then you called him a shade." I said, staring at them. "We did?" Nicole blinked, owlishly at me. Sighing, I gave up. "I'm going to the museum shop." I told them, picking my purple backpack up and walking over there. The sign beside it wrote; Stuffed Pegasi for $5 dollars each! Going inside, I bought a stuffed black pegasus. It was really cute, actually. "I guessed that I would see you here." Someone said. Turning around, I saw Ms. Leors. She was a devil. The worst teacher ever, and she seemed to hate Nicole, Zagreus and I. "What are you doing here alone?" She asked me. "I wanted to visit the shop." I replied in a duh tone of voice. "Don't use that tone with me, young lady." Ms. Leors' eyes seemed to glow red. Or maybe that was a trick of the light? "I have to go." I payed for the toy, stuffed it into my backpack and left. Deciding to put the sword in my backpack, I used some wrapping paper that was in my backpack to wrap it up and put it in. I heard Ms. Leors turn and shift through some things behind me. "What did you get?" Zagreus asked me. He seemed really anxious for some reason. "A black pegasus. Why?" I answered. "Nothing. Just wondering." Zagreus replied. "Let's go check out the 'rooms'!" Nicole said. "I heard they have good architecture." I sighed as I followed her. I saw Zagreus roll his eyes, and look around the place. "Fine." We both agreed. I saw Ms. Leors watching us from the corner of my eye.
