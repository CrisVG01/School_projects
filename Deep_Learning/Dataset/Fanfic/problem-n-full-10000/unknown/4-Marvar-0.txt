I've been too timid to do more than lightly brush over it. "Can I have this?" I ask. "Mmm, Yes." I push down his underwear, letting his erection spring free. He's beautiful and long and thick. The purplish pink tip is shiny and resting on his belly. I reach out and give it an experimental stroke. Edward grabs my hand and strokes slowly with me. "I'm going to make you completely let go and scream out something dirty when I make you come again," he says. He rolls on his back and pulls me on top of him. His erection is hot and hard and rubbing between my lips. "Ohh," I whisper. He rolls his hips, pushing himself into position. He lifts me up and holds me over the tip of his erection. I bite my lip when he pulls me down, slowly filling me up with him. "Good?" he asks with a grunt. I can feel the tension in his thighs. I know he wants to move. "Yes. You feel so good." He kneads my ass, thrusting up, slow and deep. I brace myself, hands on his chest. "Oh my god, please." I can feel the steady heat, low and deep. His slow upward strokes turn into a deep, quick snaps of his hips. He holds me down, pressed against him. I can feel him, so hot, so thick, stretching me. Making me burn. "Oh...don't stop...please." "Never, baby." "Please...I love it." "You feel so good. Tell me what you need," he whispers. "I need to come...Edward," I plead. He speeds up, hitting the spot that has never been found before, that I never thought existed. I gasp for breath, panting and begging for this not to end. "That's it, Bella. You're almost there." He keeps pumping into me, and I my breaths are so shallow I'm almost sobbing, and oh, I can't anymore...I'm going to, "Fuuuccccckkkk!" "Mmmmm, yes. I can feel you coming." I collapse on his chest as he slows down his thrusts and stills. It's all heavy breathing and sweat for a few moments. He slides out of me and tucks me into his side. "I knew it would be like this," he says. "You were right." "I just said that." "No. About what I needed." "Yeah?" "I needed a good, loud, 'fuck.' " . . . . . "I love you." "I know," he says, nuzzling my neck. We're sitting on the couch in our living room, entertaining Emmett who's been kicked out of Rosalie's house once again. "Entertaining" is being polite - we're waiting until he gets the hint that we need alone time. "For fuck's sake. You two are nauseating," Emmett complains. "Can you please stop with your Star Wars love fest, Han and Leia?" "Then get out, Emmett. Go be with your...whatever she is." "My baby mama." Edward laughs and grabs my hand dramatically. "Do you want to be my baby mama, Bella?" "Shut up, Edward." I push him away, playfully. "You better put a ring on it first." "I better do that, huh?" he says, kissing my left hand. "I guess this one wasn't enough." He nods toward the giant rock on my fourth finger. "Look how she controls you, Edward. This is how you talk to your woman." He takes out his phone and makes a call. "Babe? Yeah. I'm horny. Yeah. Okay. Be over in ten. Later." "That's how it's done," he says smugly. "And now I have to go. I need to stop and get some diapers and a bottle of vodka or Rosie will kick me out again." "You are a fine example of a baby daddy, Emmett. Edward, take notes." "What can I say? My spunk is unstoppable." "Yes. It was amazing that you knocked up a woman who already had four kids. That's like a medical miracle, right Edward?" He stops kissing my neck long enough to reply, "Only if he inpregnated her feet." Emmett laughs. "Well, she does have cankles now. But I like it. More to bite." I roll my eyes. "Nice. She'd kick your ass if she heard that." "She's going to do that anyways when she finds out I spent all my paycheck on my new tattoo. I'm just going to try to get some before she sees it. That's going to be hard since it's right by my balls." We both turn to each other and say, "I've got a bad feeling about this." This sends us into a fit of laughter. Emmett shakes his head in disgust. "You two are so weird. But I guess that's why you work as a couple." "We definitely work as a couple," I say. "I'm outta here. Bye, Bella. Bye, Remington Steele, Jr." Edward groans. "Why did I say that my mam dated Pierce Brosnan when they were teens? I will never hear the end of that, will I?" "I'd shout it out to the rooftops if I was your mom. He's still hot." "Should I be jealous?" he asks. He pulls me onto his lap. "Maybe in 1984. But now, you've got him beat." "I'm a little insulted." "Have you seen him in a tuxedo?" "Have you seen me in a tuxedo?" "Next month I will. Then I'll let you know." "I haven't seen you in your wedding dress and I already know that you'll be the most beautiful bride." "Dr. Cullen, you say the most wonderful things. Are you trying to get in my pants?" "Do. Or do not. There is no try." "I vote do. As in do me now." Edward laughs as he fingers me. "Fuck. So proud that you brought me over to the Dark Side, aren't you?" "It is your destiny, Bella. Now it is time to unleash the power of the Force. I hope your pussy can take it." . . . . . AN: Thanks to Dr. Raina who preread and said my medical knowledge was passible.
