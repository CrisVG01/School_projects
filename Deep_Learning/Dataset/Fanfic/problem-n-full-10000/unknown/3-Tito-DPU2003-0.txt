and they saw a monster on Leo's working desk. It was Leo's box! " Draw back, Leo!" Percy walked to the front with his magic sword. He had a fought with the monster. Suddenly, the monster jumped up and grabbed Percy's arm. His sword had thrown out. " Percy! Careful!" Annabeth screamed to him. Suddenly, the monster box jumped up again, but this time was into them with it sharp spikes. Then everything went black. 4. Chapter 4: The Matrix Of Darkness Calypso woke up in dark and silent. She felt a little bit hurt at her head. " What's this place and where are everyone?" Calypso talked to her mind. " Hey Callie! I'm here!" yelled Annabeth. She ran to Calypso. " Do you know where this place is?" asked Annabeth. " I don't know. I'm not sure we're in Leo's working room." said Calypso when she looked around. " Look, Calypso! Behind you!" Annabeth screamed. Calypso turned back and she saw... the monster box! It was running into them. " Draw back, Callie!" Annabeth said. She went to the front with her weapon was a short knife. She had a slashing battle with the monster box. The monster box ran away after almost of it spikes were cut down by Annabeth. " We should find out where everyone are." said Annabeth. " But...how?" said Calypso. " Too dark in here. I almost can't see anything. And what will happen when the monster come back?" " OK, just try." said Annabeth. They walked slowly in the dark with their eyes were nearly blind. This place was too silent. Calypso can heard clearly they steps sound. " Hey Calypso, look at that!" yelled Annabeth when she saw a light. " Should we go into that light?" said Calypso. " Do it. And find out." said Annabeth with her voice clear. They went closer to the mystery light that they were not sure what was it. Suddenly, they heard a noise. " Hello? Anyone? I need help!". Calypso shocked. That was Leo's voice. " Leo, where are you?" said Annabeth with her voice loudly. " I'm here! Upper of you!" yelled Leo. Annabeth looked up and she saw Leo was entangled in a huge spider nest. " Stay there, Leo! We'll come to rescue you!" Calypso yelled. " Look, Callie! I can't go anywhere with this!" said Leo. " Ladies to the rescue!' yelled Annabeth. Annabeth tried hardly climbed up a wall near the spider nest. The wall was very old so it face was really scabrous. That made Annabeth climbed easier. When she climbed to the top, she grabbed a corner of the nest and tried to cut it. The nest fell down with Leo inside it. " Be carefull!" Calypso screamed when she saw Leo fell down the ground. " Are you OK?" asked Calypso when she walked to Leo. " I'm OK. This ground is pretty soft."smiled Leo. " We've got to find the others." said Annabeth when she climbed down the wall. " Annabeth!" yelled Percy. " Seaweed Brain, where are you all the time?" asked Annabeth. " I've got stuck in a water pond with seaweed grabbed my feet. They were trying to make me drown. But you know, I'm a son of Poseidon, the god of the ocean, so I... " OK, OK, I already know the end of your story." grinned Leo. They continued their journey to find everyone. After a few hours, they arrived to a giant statue of Zeus. " I bet that Jason must be somewhere around here." said Percy when he tapped a finger on the Zeus statue giant toe. " Why?' asked Calypso. " Cause' he is a son of Zeus." Annabeth smiled. They sat down under the giant statue, took a break. Actually, there is no signal to demonstrate that Jason was here. But then, they heard a sound. It came from under the statue giant foot. " It must be someone!" said Annabeth when she heard that noise. " Let's find out!" said Percy. " How can we get in?" Calypso asked when she tapped her hand on Zeus giant foot. Suddenly, the giant foot was picked up and there was a tunnel under it. " How strange is it!" said Leo with surprised. They went inside the tunnel. After a few minutes, they saw Piper, Hazel and were hiding behind a wall. " Piper! Hazel! Frank!" yelled Calypso. " Ssshhh!" Piper whisted when she saw her friends. " Come here." said Frank. " What's happening?" said Percy. " There's no time to explain!" said Piper. They quickly went behind the wall with Piper and Hazel. " Tell me, what's happening?" asked Annabeth. " Look!" said Piper. She pointed to a small shelf on the ground. And behind it was... the monster box! It was running to them with it sharp spikes. Everyone ran out of the wall. Frank jumped out with his bear arm, pushed the box to the opposite wall. After a slashing battle again, the monster box growed bigger and more dangerous." Now it's monster boss!" said Leo. The monster jumped on them, roared and wanted to kill all of them. It pushed everyone down on the ground, used it big claws to attack them. When it claws nearly touched Hazel, suddenly, the monster box stopped and fell to the ground with a huge noise. Everyone stood up, surprised and frightened. " Are you OK?" Frank asked Hazel when she stood up. " I'm OK." said Hazel, still frightened. " What's wrong with it?" said Annabeth. " I knew it! Leo said. " When I and Calypso were fixing it last few months, we've made it explored by putting to much electricity inside it! That's why it was dangerous!" " Oh, yes!" Calypso grinned. Everybody smiled and laughed. Then everyone tried to find the way out. Surprised, Piper met Jason at the way they went out. Life turned to normal to everyone. The End
