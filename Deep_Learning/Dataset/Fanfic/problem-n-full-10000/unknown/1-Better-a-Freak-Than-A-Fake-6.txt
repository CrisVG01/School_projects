course it had been days since he last got any sleep and though his body had gotten used to it even he wasn't able to keep his eyes open. He tried to fight it terrified of what would happen otherwise but did fall asleep. Unfortunately his father noticed and gathered the other students. "You all know the drill." He said, motioning to Kawino. "Yes sir!" They said grabbing their best weapons and swarming toward him. He was just barely starting to wake back up a little but it was too late as they all attacked and he shifted moving on instinct breaking one boy's neck. He turned and slammed his fist into a girl's trachea collapsing it. He pulled a knife and stabbed another girl in the heart. He turned and stabbed a boy in the temple with the same knife. The kids began to back away as their team members began to drop. His parents simply watch the scene go down with slight smiles on their faces. He finally woke up fully surrounded by bodies. "I never thought I'd say this but good job, Kawino." "Wh...what?" He asked looking over to them. "You did a good job." He said motioning around the bodies. "What did I do?" He asked confused. "Look around." He glanced around at the fallen students and the others backing away from him. "I did this?" "That you did. Don't you remember?" "No, I don't remember I was just moving." "Then that's finally something we can work with." "So, I did good?" He asked as they stopped in front of him. "Yes, you actually did." His mother said. "Okay." He said hesitantly. "Calm down, you're not going to be punished." She said figuring that was what it was about. "I'm not?" He said still hesitant. "No, as he said, you did a good job." "So, what happens now?" He asked. "You can go when everyone else does today." "Okay." He shrugged for some reason not seeming surprised. "You did great." She said hugging him. "Okay… one question…" he said awkwardly. "What?" She asked. "Who are you?" "I'm your mother." "Oh, okay." He said and returned the hug. "Thank you, Mom." "My pleasure, Sweetie." She said. "I'm sorry but I can't remember anything." "That's alright we'll fix that later." She said surprisingly gentle. "Alright, I trust you." "Good." She said soothingly. "What happened here?" Asked a shocked voice, having just gotten back from getting some things for the class. "Oh, Clove, you're back." Their mother said. "What happened here?" She asked again, staring at the dead bodies in absolute shock. "Nothing, Kawino had a bit of an episode is all." She said rubbing her sons back. "A bit of an… Kawino, are you okay?" She asked, temporarily disregarding the other students. "Who?" Kawino asked. "Who what?" She asked, with a raised eyebrow coming over to him. "Who are you?" She realized what must have happened and said carefully, "I'm Clove, your sister." "I have a sister?!" He gasped. "Yes you do." "That's fun." He said rubbing his head. "Mind if I take a look there?" "Uh, can she?" He asked their mother. "Yes she can." "Sure." He shrugged. She moved some of his hair to get a good look at the injury. "It looks pretty bad. What happened?" She asked their mother. "He fell asleep." Clove sighed. That's a rule that's in place for everyone, in every class, in every academy, in all three Career Districts so she didn't think much about it. "So, what happens to him now?" "We need to find a way to get his memory back." Mantear stated. "Well, I am not sure how." Clove said. "Neither am I." "Maybe he needs rest?" Cato suggested. "Could be a good idea." Mantear said totally out of character for her. "Yes it may be the best option." "Just take him to his room. I'll get him excused." She said since being his mother and trainer both give her the jurisdiction. Clove nodded helping him to his feet. "You can trust me right?" She asked him carefully. "I suppose so." He said. "Good, just follow me then." He did, not questioning her. She took him up to their shared bedroom. "Which bed's mine?" She pointed to the mattress on the floor. He looked at it oddly and then at hers and back. "Oh… o…kay." "What?" She asked. "It's just… odd." He said, not sure what else to say. It seemed extremely unfair but he figured there must have been a good reason. "Okay?" She said confused. He laid down on the mattress trying to sort this stuff out which was pretty much impossible to do when you don't even know who you are. "Clove, can I ask you something?" "Sure, anything." "Did I usually stay in there after everyone else left?" He asked, since Mantear had said he could leave with the others as if that's a new thing though he was unclear what exactly 'there' was. "Yeah, usually." Clove shrugged. "Why?" "You train more." She said. "What do you mean train?" He asked, sitting up. "Train for what?" She sighed and sat on her bed. "For the Hunger Games." Once it was said Kawino did recognize the name. He closed his eyes again trying to focus on that getting some of the most basic straight up facts. "Where teens are force to fight to the death… right?" "Exactly." She said smiling a little that he was remembering. "So… is it normal to train for those?" "In some places. In most places it's illegal to train. Here it's illegal not to unless you're sick." "So I'm sick?" "Well, or injured and you do have amnesia." "I guess you have a point." "I do need to get back though." "Okay," He shrugged. "I'll come check on you after training though." Clove promised and headed down. So that's about it. Since I rambled your poor ears off in the beginning and leave it with a polite, please review.
