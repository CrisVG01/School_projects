smiled as I laid my phone down. I hope this date goes well, usually I freeze up on dates and rarely get asked out again. I hope it is different with Edward. I checked to make sure the door was locked and then I headed up to my bedroom. I always enjoyed the children's holiday parties, they had a lot of fun and we did many activities for them. We planned a little egg hunt for them and of course giving out their little baskets before they went home. I got ready for bed and then climbed into bed. It wouldn't take me long to fall asleep tonight. The day seemed to go well and I was happy to be done with school for a week. It will give me time to get things done and of course my date with Edward tomorrow night. I was nervous but I think it will go good. We seem to click, at least on the phone. I puttered around my house on Friday and then I picked out my outfit for my date. I texted him my address, but he called back to let me know he got it and we ended up talking for about an hour while he was on his lunch break. I decided that I would wear a skirt and my blue shirt that I would wear a black jacket with and a pair of black flats. As I got out of the shower, I heard the doorbell ring and I looked at the clock to see that it was too early for Edward to be there so I threw on my robe and went to see who it was. I opened the door to see Rosalie standing there. At least it wasn't Alice. Rosalie I could handle, she wasn't as bad as Alice. "Hey, I thought I'd come and help you get ready," she said with a smile. "Thanks, I just got out of the shower and I already picked out my outfit." "Awesome, I'll help you with your hair or just calm your nerves," she said with a laugh. "Edward is at my house, he's a bit nervous too." "I'm not nervous," I told her as I turned to walk upstairs. "Sure you're not." "I'm not, really. Just a wee bit." "I know you are, but I know that you and Edward will be perfect together. You have a lot in common and both have been crushing on each other for a bit. Don't tell him I said that though." "You didn't tell him that I thought he was gorgeous, did you?" "Of course not, Bella." I nodded as I sat down in front of the vanity and she picked up my hairbrush. "I was thinking of putting some curls in, what do you think?" I asked as she brushed through my hair. "That will work but I'll work my magic on it and I'm sure you'll love it. I know Edward will love it." I smiled up at her in the mirror as she did my hair, she parted it and then added some curls to one side and then she slipped in a headband. "Perfect," she exclaimed as she put the brush down. I looked at myself in the mirror and smiled, "It looks great, thank you. Better than just my normal everyday style." She nodded as she went to grab my clothes on the bed, "This outfit you chose is perfect, Bella." "You think so?" "I do. The blue will look amazing against your skin and I'll help with your makeup too," she said as she handed me the clothes. "Okay, I'll go slip into these. I'll be right back," I said as I went into the bathroom. I quickly got dressed and looked in the mirror, I hope that these nerves disappear soon. Once I finished, I walked back into my bedroom and let Rosalie work her magic on my makeup. I sat down and she started applying the various products that she laid out. I know that I could do it myself but she wanted to help me. "I can't wait to hear where he's taking you. He hasn't even told Emmett. He said he wanted it to be a surprise and he knows that Emmett would tell me and I'd probably tell you," she said as she was putting on some eyeshadow. "True, you would tell me. I think I like it this way, the element of surprise," I said. "You hate surprises though." "Normally I do, but it seems really romantic that he wanted to plan everything and not let me know where we are going. I just asked him what I should wear so I'd have some clue about how to dress." "You two are too cute. I know this is going to work out." She finished my face and I looked in the mirror and smiled at her. "Thank you, it looks great." "You look great all the time," she said as I got up and gave her a quick hug as her phone chimed. She looked down at it and smiled. "He just left my house." "Oh my word," I said as I rushed to grab my shoes and my jacket and my small purse, suddenly very nervous. "Calm down, Bella. It will be fine. You said it yourself you got along well on the phone. It will be just like that but you can see each other." I nodded as I slipped my shoes on and we went downstairs. "Call me later and let me know how everything goes. Smile, you look amazing and it will be fine," she said as she hugged me quickly and left. I took a deep breath as waited for Edward to arrive. It wasn't long before I heard a car pull up and then a car door open and shut. I could hear my heart beating loudly in my ears as I waited for him to knock on the door.
