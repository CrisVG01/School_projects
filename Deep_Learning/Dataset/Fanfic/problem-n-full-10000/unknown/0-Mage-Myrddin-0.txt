war. He used them to fight Voldemort, but no matter how many people died, he never ever used the Resurrection Stone, not since he'd died in the Forbidden Forest. He didn't want to hear them blame him. After Teddy died, the temptation grew, but so did the fear that those he called to him would hate him. Despite that, the only thing that stopped him from going ahead and seeing Teddy was something Dumbledore said in his first year. "It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, Harry, remember that." The knowledge that calling Teddy back wouldn't make him alive, wouldn't make him the same as he was before, was all that stopped Harry. And then the war ended. He had seen how much damage the Hallows could do and rightly concluded that leaving them around for anyone to find once he had died was a spectacularly bad idea. Harry broke and threw away both the wand and the ring numerous times, but they always seemed to come back. Eventually in a fit of rage, he had used the wand to destroy the ring, and to his delight the power of the combined hallows was broken. After that, the wand didn't fix itself when snapped, so he tossed one half in the Room of Requirement and placed the other in Dumbledore's tomb, to be found by whichever idiot tracked the deathstick to one of the most powerful wizards ever to live. Harry hoped they enjoyed the fact that they only succeeded in finding half of a hallow. All of which led them here, sat by the grave of one that he loved like a son, both wishing desperately to speak with Teddy again and afraid of what the dead child would say. Barely having contact with the outside world, rarely speaking to anyone other than himself, with no goal to achieve or direction to take in life. He might as well be dead. In the distance, the clock tower struck midnight. On the twelfth stroke, a ball of golden light appeared rather abruptly behind Harry. Noticing the light instantly, the wandless spell that indicated magical presence chiming crazily in his ear, Harry threw himself to the side and rolled up, stopping the magical detection spell and placing a wandless shield charm up instead. His wand appeared from it's custom holster and a curse was ready on his lips as he took in the unusual sight before him. "Who are you?" Harry demanded, his voice rough and his eyes gritty with grief and memories. "I AM FATE." The glowing entity spoke. At least, Harry was pretty sure it spoke. The words seemed to appear straight in his head without going past his ears. Harry's eyes narrowed. "Why are you here? You've screwed up enough, I think." "IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE ONLY HOURS AFTER YOU DID, BUT RULES WERE BROKEN AND HE SURVIVED. MANY PEOPLE WHO DIED SHOULD HAVE LIVED, AND MANY WHO LIVED DESERVE TO DIE. YOU BROUGHT THE BALANCE BACK BY KILLING HIM, AND FOR THIS I OWE YOU A DEBT." "You didn't answer my question." Harry said dangerously. "And why do I care? I didn't kill him for you." "DEATH ALSO OWES YOU A DEBT, FOR YOU ENSURED THAT NONE COULD BECOME HIS MASTER IN THIS WORLD. AND YOU CARE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HAPPY. WE WISH TO HELP." "I want nothing from you." Harry growled. "OH? WE WOULD SEND YOU TO A NEW WORLD, A NEW LIFE. YOU WOULD HAVE LODGINGS, MONEY, SEATS ON THE WIZENGAMOT SHOULD YOU CHOSE TO TAKE THEM. YOU COULD FIND PEACE." Harry snorted. "Trouble finds me like a magnet. It wouldn't be peaceful for very long." "YOUNG WIZARD, DO NOT DELIBERATELY MISUNDERSTAND MY STATEMENT. YOU HAVE NOT FOUGHT FOR THREE YEARS, AND YOU ARE NOT HAPPY. I MEAN PEACE OF MIND." "Peace of mind?" Harry looked at Fate oddly. "What the hell is that supposed to mean? Never mind." He said before Fate could answer. "Where exactly do you want me to go?" "AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE. A WHAT-MIGHT-HAVE-BEEN OF YOUR LIFE. YOUR PARENTS WOULD BE ALIVE, AS WOULD THE HARRY OF THAT WORLD. THE MAJORITY OF YOUR POSSESIONS WOULD GO WITH YOU. YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE YOUR INVISIBILITY CLOAK, AS THERE IS ALREADY ONE THERE. YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CALL ON DEATH AND I WHENEVER YOU LIKE, THOUGH I ASK YOU ONLY DO SO WHEN NECESSARY. THAT WORLD WOULD NOT HAVE A WAR, AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD LEAD THEM THROUGH THE CHANGES THAT OCCURED FOR THE BETTER AT THE END OF THE WAR WITHOUT THE SAME DESTRUCTION IF YOU CHOSE." Harry internally cursed his hero complex for making him want to accept before considering it logically. Was it worth it? Fate was telling the truth about owing him, but that didn't mean Fate was telling the whole truth. "People will figure out who I am pretty quickly if I look as much like my father as everyone says." Harry pointed out. "I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR LOOKS AND BACKGROUND. YOU WILL HAVE TIME TO ADJUST TO YOUR NEW LIFE BEFORE ANYTHING IS EXPECTED OF YOU." Harry hesitated. He knew that when something seemed to be to good to be true, it usually was. But still, what did he have to lose? He wasn't doing a lot - or even anything - here. "Very well, I'll go." He agreed. "DONE." Fate said, sounding oddly triumphant. Before Harry could wonder why he felt so uneasy at the obvious victory in Fate's voice, the world swirled around him and he fell into his first dreamless sleep since forever. So, first chapter again. THIS HAS BEEN REWRITTEN. One of my reviewers pointed out that it wasn't enough like C'est La Vie by cywscross to cause concern, and while that is true, I think I could write bits of it better. So here we are. Enjoy, Shib. :)
