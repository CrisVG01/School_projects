my work," she replied, smiling at him. "Sometimes the night shift is hard- oh, I didn't mean you!" Cho grew flustered as Harry quirked his eyebrows, and added, "You don't bother me at all. You're special to meâ€¦" The words flowed from her lips before she could stop them and she felt her face turn red. There was a sudden awkward silence. The pause in the conversation spoke volumes to her. Harry's kind nature was expressed by the sudden silence; he was trying to figure out how to let her down lightly. Cho coughed lightly and stood up, wanting to leave before anything more was said. But Harry stopped her, "Wait, Cho. If you couldn't get over me, I'm sorry." Damn, he knew. She glanced back at him. "You don't have to say sorry, Harry," she said, tears welling up in her eyes. "Call me if you need anything. Have a good rest, Harry." She decided after that day that she would stop seeking Harry out. But she couldn't break off her connection to him. One day, she received an owl from Luna Lovegood. Luna had loved Dumbledore's Army more than anyone. She had planned the reunion party. Cho noticed her DA coin was calling her during the night shift, but she ignored it. She smiled bitterly as she thought of how she always kept it in her pocket. The coin was a symbol of her connection to Harry. She should've returned it to Hermione Granger. Watching the hands on the clock tick to eight p.m., Cho started her rounds. When she turned the corner to the West wing, she noticed Parvati was standing in front of the bright yellow double-doors. "Cho, why didn't you come to the party? We've been waiting for you. I volunteered to come drag you over there," she said. "I can't, Parvati. Night shift, you know." Cho was walking pass by her. "Roisin will cover for you. Come with me." "But I don't have dress robes." "You look just fine in your Healer's robes. Come on!" She could guess what would happen if she went with Parvati. When they got to the party, she felt that she shouldn't have been there. All the members of DA got together to share the same emotions; missing their glorious days at Hogwarts and catching up with their friends. She felt like an intruder. Then she found Harry among the crowd, and her heart sped up. "Hey, look, Cho came! Look at the beautiful Healer!" Seamus said playfully, nudging Harry. How deeply she longed for his green eyes, the color of spring leaves. She knew the perfect jet-black hair was soft, as she happened to touch it many times while tending his wounds in the private ward. She knew all his scars which showed how many times he managed to survive. To help him to recover made her feel that she was fighting with him for greater things for the world. "Cho. Your robes suit you well," Harry said gently. "Thank you," she smiled at him, feeling supreme bliss; but the moment was broken suddenly, like a glass falling and shattering, when Ginny stepped forward and steered him into the platform. Cho heard her tell him, "Come on, Harry. It's time to make a speech." She'd prepared herself for this. She could behave as if nothing had happened, as if seeing Harry look happy with Ginny didn't hurt. She even found a new conversation partner - Michael Corner. He confessed her that he couldn't forget her after the war and had been waiting for the right moment to ask her to go out with him again. She chose him. But her nightmares started that day. She had sealed the memory of Cedric away in her mind, but he came back to her in her dream that night. Cedric was carried into the ward. His body was covered with blisters and nasty wounds. Cho tried to speak to him, but no answer came from the stiff body. She put sterilized gauze on one of the gaping wounds and stitched the other. As soon as she finished, another wound was found. He looked nearly dead, but she had to bring him around. She pulled out her wand to make sure his pulse was normal. When she pointed her wand at his neck, he opened his eyes and stared at her. She got startled as his face morphed into Harry's. His green eyes were cold and angry as he stared her down. "Why didn't you fight with me?" "I did, Harry. I did. I went back to Hogwarts." "Yes, you did. But you didn't believe me. You are not strong enough." Tears welled up in her eyes at his furious declaration. "Don't cry again. I'm warning you," Harry reproved her, standing up from the bed. "I won't," she shouted, and left him. She walked out of the hospital and started running down the hill. The ground was slimy and covered with moss; her lime green robes became stained with splashes of mud in an instant. When she reached the bottom, she was standing on a cliff which rose sharply out of nothingness. Beyond the edge, there was nothing but endless black space. When she awoke, Cho wiped the wet traces of tears from her in the early morning light. That was the day she left the magical world. The coffee shop was getting crowded. Her bitter memory was laid aside as she served coffee and snacks. The old man with the flat cap stood up from his seat and left for his lecture. It might be a good idea to study in the Muggle world to start a new life, Cho thought. Maybe next spring, She told herself, and wiped up spilled coffee from the counter. ************************************************************************************************************************ Author's Note Cherry blossoms started blooming here and there.
