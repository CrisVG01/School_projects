Antonia is who entered your room. Your honor is…" "Stop. Just stop." Isabella was tired of the ups and downs her emotions had taken over the past several days. She just wanted silence and peace, and no amount of words was going to change that. After everything that had happened, her honor was far down the list of things she desired. Edward wisely ceased talking. She looked over at the pile of widow's weeds strewn across her tiny room and sighed. It was a well thought out plan—her switching clothes and departing the train right under her uncle and Mr. Black's nose. She just had never imagined it was a man aiding her. "So I'm to put these on? Over my clothes?" He nodded, still with his back to her. "Agent Cullen, I am fully dressed now." There was the faintest tinge of humor in her voice which relaxed Edward as he turned around. She really was quite a vision in the dim oil light, her hair slightly mussed from dressing rapidly, cheeks flushed a rosy pink, eyes bright with excitement. He realized that was not the line of thought he needed to be taking under these circumstances. "Alice designed the skirt to create extra pleats to fit you," Edward mumbled, stepping out of the pool of black material at his feet. "Alice?" "My sister. Jasper's wife." "So he really is your in-law." Edward nodded. "And where you will be staying until you can go home." "If there is a trial." "Oh, with the information your uncle gave us, I am certain Mr. Black will see the inside of a prison for a long, long time." Isabella smiled, feeling that warm sense of hope creep into her once again. "Then let us do this." Two weeks had passed, and Isabella Swan sat on the porch swing at the home of Jasper and Alice Whitlock, a newspaper in her lap and a glass of cool water nearby. Jacob Black arrested. Crime king faces charges on multiple counts. The headlines had been more frequent since the Chicago police had converged upon the Black Hearted Gang's headquarters and finally found their leader hiding in a warehouse down by the lake. The papers were offering up to twenty-five dollars for stories related to the Gang's activities, the more salacious, the better. Jasper had teased Isabella she could pay for her own ticket back to Buffalo if she went forward about his brother-in-law wearing a dress. She had smiled politely and kindly shook her head. She was not certain she wanted to go back to Forks. A part of her liked Chicago—at least what she had experienced of it so far. Additionally, there was the fact that no one would ever believe a Pinkerton Agency agent would dress as a widow, exchange clothes with her, and then watch as she simply walked off the train while Uncle James, nursing a head-splitting headache searched high and low for his niece. His body had been found floating in a river a few days later. Jasper had tried to hide the information from her, but the newspaper hawkers had been almost gleeful in their shouting as she walked through the street market with a waddling Alice. Isabella did say a prayer for the soul of James Higginbotham, brother of her late mother, not James Hunter, member of Jacob Black's gang. She sighed at the memory, lightly fanning herself with the newspaper. That was the last time she had seen Agent Cullen. He was standing off to the side of the train platform as Alice ran to embrace Jasper as quickly as her seven-month-pregnant body would allow. And then he was gone. Isabella had asked Jasper and Alice as they walked to a waiting carriage where he had gone only to be told there was a report to be made, and it was his way to finish a job as quickly as possible. She had tried to hide her disappointment, but the look Alice gave her said she had not done a very good job. The sound of crisp footsteps on the sidewalk brought Isabella's attention around and to her surprise and delight, a certain gentleman she had just been thinking of was rapidly approaching. "Good afternoon, Miss Swan." "Good afternoon, Agent Cullen. Fancy seeing you here." His ears and cheeks tinged a faint shade of pink as he stood at the bottom of the steps leading up to the porch. "My sister has invited me to supper. Did she not tell you?" Isabella shook her head. That would explain the handsome black suit he wore. He dressed up to visit his family. "And I have received a message from your father that I wished to pass on." She had not heard from her father in almost a week. They were trying to mend their relationship as well as him find employment, but memories were long in a small town and Charlie was pondering moving west. Edward pulled a folded piece of paper from an inner pocket and held it up to her. Isabella opened it and read the single word, yes. It made no sense to her, and she turned toward Edward to ask what it meant. "I asked if I had his permission to court his only daughter. " Oh. OH! The comprehension of what he said finally struck. "With her approval, of course." With a shy smile, Isabella nodded. "Then perhaps, Miss Swan, you would do me the honor of a turn around the park before supper?" Edward held out his hand which Isabella took as she stood and allowed him to assist her as she descended the few stairs off the porch. He pressed a soft kiss to her fingertips before lacing her arm through his as they began their way toward the park, earning a radiant smile in return. "So, Agent Cullen, tell me what you have been doing since we last saw each other." And he did. I hope you enjoyed this! DeJean
