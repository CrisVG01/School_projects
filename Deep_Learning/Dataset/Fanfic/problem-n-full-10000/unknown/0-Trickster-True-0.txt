distance. He scrambled at the ground, pushing up with his feet. He shot to his feet, staring at Richie. The boy looked at him with a rather confused look in his eye, lowering his foot back to the ground and the path of scattered woodchips. Harry's eyes flicked in between all of them again as if something would change. He shook his head as if it would clear thoughts, slowly backing up. His gaze fell upon Dudley and narrowed. Harry waited only a second before turning around and booking it. He sprinted as fast as he could through the park, shooting out on the other side. The sun was closing in on the horizon, sending shadows over his path. The path was well worn, with footprints pressed onto every part. The path ran straight up to the sidewalk on Privet Drive, so all in all, it was only a five to ten minute run there. Though Harry couldn't run all the way. He paused once. Maybe twice. He was nine bloody years old, thank you very much. Number four was quickly approaching when the sun started to touch the horizon. Harry trotted the rest of the way there, calming his quick and shallow breaths. He turned in every direction but didn't see any of the members of the gang, much less Dudley. Harry crept back to the house, going into the garden. He was so, so careful not to step on anything, even hopping for a fair distance to avoid cat-grass. He ducked underneath the windowsill, nearly hitting his head on it. He waited for a second but didn't hear anything. Slowly, he peeked his head up to glance over the sill. His gaze met a blank looking living room with a rather large telly and two long couches neatly tucked up in one corner. On the opposite wall, there was a long counter made of light tan wood and a spider webbed gray granite. On the wall, there was a digital clock, which Harry's attention snapped to. 5:48pm Still twelve minutes until he needed to start cooking. He ducked back underneath the windowsill, examining his surroundings. The rosebushes were right in front of him but with a careful jump of the bunch hyacinths, he would be fine. Executing it as best he could, he managed to get over with only a disturbed spot of dirt. He quickly knelt and smoothed it out, placing wood chips over it. His attention slid over to a lone patch of cat-grass by his left elbow. Slowly, almost hypnotically, he parted the blue-green stems. The bumpy, dark green leaves and thin stalk glittering with tiny needles stared up at him, barely hidden within the cat-grass. Harry watched it sway slightly in a breeze, brushing up against the other stems. He remembered Dudley, the punch to his back, the foot squashing him into the ground. He looked up, but couldn't see the clock from there. But from a rough guess, Harry though he might still have ten minutes before he had to cook. Reaching forward, he began to pull off some of the needles one by one, wincing whenever one stung him. The stinging nettle stood strong throughout it all. Harry laid underneath the stairs in a tiny room that he had to curl his legs to his chest to fit comfortably. He was wide awake, having only been sent here a few minutes ago. His ears were pricked towards the ceiling, focusing, waiting. A cry of surprise echoed through the house down to him, and Harry Potter smiled. Dudley sure hadn't expected needles in his covers. Bam! Here's a new story I've had for a while. Sorry for my WDNWTF fans, but I want to also write this. This, to my knowledge and much scourging of fanfiction, is a very different story than most. I hope you can enjoy it and even offer suggestions. That's actually something that's very important to me; I want everyone to help out with this story. SO if you have even the slightest idea for me, submit it! You just might get in and there's no bad thigns that happen, so why not? Easy way to get your way in a (hopefully) good story! But let me make it very clear: Harry is NOT going to be dark and evil. He simply has a… disorder and a certain grudge against the Dursleys. He won't be torturing them or anything. Sorry evil Harry fans… :/ But anyway! Please read and review! Frost OUT! Hey Trickster True here. Now I'm sure that many of you will recognize this story and for those of you who don't know for whatever reason, FrostedDusk had put up this story, Stinging Nettles, for adoption. Quite obviously, I adopted it. I'm here to say I will be posting a chapter at least once a week so I can write more and edit where it's due. I'm also here inform everyone that all of the chapters that Frost wrote will not be edited and that, yes, I am keeping her ANs in here. Where she left off is where MY writing will begin, so if my writing doesn't do this story justice then tell me when the time comes so I can either fix it or – if there are too many people saying that my writing isn't good enough for this story – give it back to her so she can find someone better for it. Because this is just such an awesome story. The second she ever decides to continue this and I haven't gotten my writing up then I'll see if she'll want me to stop, if my writing is up then I'll try my hardest to not make it seem like it's a sibling story or whatever. If you're just stumbling across this then go to FrostedDusk's page and give her your praises, not me. This is her story at the moment, until my writing is up I hold no claim to it.
