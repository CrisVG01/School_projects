I scrambled for the sheets to cover the exposed parts of my skin. Edward shrugged. I narrowed my eyes angrily. He only shrugged? Oh…he was really pushing my buttons. He sighed. His expression turned painfully guilty. About time. "I've had all night to think about this. I am very sorry for acting so rashly. I would have liked to blame it on sheer impulse, but it was really me…just being a jerk." He said after a few silent minutes. I blinked, astonished. "I want you to go. I want you to go to New York. I am soo sorry for doing this. I want you to understand exactly how sorry I am. It pains me to have hurt you like this. Please believe me, Bella. I love you. More than anything in the world. More than my own life! Please forgive me. I can't do this to you…I can't. It's just…I'm so sorry." He said in a painfully honest voice. Oddly enough, I wanted to go and comfort him in his grief. I shook off the irrational thought. "So…I'm free?" I asked stupidly. He nodded. Yes! I jumped up, and gathered my things. "I booked you a flight for tomorrow morning." He whispered. I nodded excitedly. "I also had a hotel room reserved for you. I thought you wouldn't want to stay here any longer…with me." He said with a pang of regret. I also felt a little sad at the immediate departure. What? No…I was glad. Right. Everything flew by quickly. I now stood alone in my hotel room. I had to admit, it was beautiful. I was lonely, but the sheets were great. I laughed sourly at my wicked humor. "You're just a little confused…that's all. You need to sleep on it, okay Bella? You also need to stop talking to yourself." I said quietly. The night dragged on. I busied myself with my clothes. What would I wear tomorrow? I couldn't keep a straight head. All my thoughts went back to how gentlemanly Edward was…after he freed me anyway. Even when I went to take a shower…he was on my mind. Now that's just gross. I decided to go to sleep early that night. That was the first night I dreamt of Edward Cullen… The next morning I was jumpy and nervous. My emotions were frayed…and I didn't know why! I called a cab…and thankfully, I made it to the airport with an hour to spare. My flight was getting closer. It was going to be right on time. For some reason, I was dreading this. "All flights to New York are boarding in forty minutes." A voice boomed. I gasped. I was out of time. Out of time for what? For Edward. What? Now that I thought about it…it wasn't boarding the flight that I was afraid of…It was leaving Edward. How did things get so messed up? I didn't think about what I was doing…I just jumped up, and ran out to the parking lot. Luggage forgotten…dignity forgotten. I just ran. I tripped…a lot…but, I still ran the whole way. I was breathless. My heart was racing. My body ached…but, oddly, I was happy to feel him near. "Edward!" I shouted. I banged on his front door. "Edward! Open the door!" I screamed. I heard him approaching the door. He opened it…ugh…not fast enough. Once it was open, he gaped at my ridiculous form. I flung myself at him. He easily caught me. His strong arms wrapped tightly around me. I marveled at the feeling. "Bella…what are you doing here?" He asked suddenly. "I couldn't leave…not knowing that I love you." I said as I stared into his green-emerald eyes. They widened a bit. "B-Bella…I…I love you too…but, I thought…" He started, but I cut him off. "Oh shut-up and kiss me." I ordered. He gaped. "W-What?" He stuttered. "I said…kiss me." I told him. He started to hesitantly lean in. Then, he stopped. "I-I can't. Are you okay, Bella?" He asked as he eyed me warily. I didn't respond…instead, I slammed my lips against his. He gave in willingly. Then, he staggered back. I was hurt. What? I wasn't good enough now? "Bella…" He whispered as he touched his lips. "I love you…I'm never leaving you." I promised as I touched my palms to his cheeks. He leaned into my touch. "Never." He agreed. (Epilogue. Author's point of view.) *A week later.* They were happy. Though there were issues in their relationship that had yet to be solved. Bella knew she had to go to college. She had gotten a week's reprieve for the 'medical emergency of her brother.' Edward knew he couldn't keep her locked away forever. "Listen, I know you have to go to college…but, I know you want to stay with me." Edward said sadly. Bella sighed, then turned and looked at her true love. "So?" She questioned. "So, I think we should come up with a compromise." Edward said with a shrug. Bella thought it through. "What kind of compromise?" She asked. "Well, I want to be with you too…but, I'm going to Dartmouth." He started suggestively. Bella shook her head. "Oh no…you're not passing up the opportunity of a life-time. This is an ivy league…we'll meet up on weekends…" Bella told him with a glare. Edward smiled, and shook his head at his beautiful Bella. "No…I could transfer to NYU…then, we'd be together…I want to be with you more than I want professors breathing down my neck about my family's money." He said with a dismissive wave. Bella smiled at her expressive boyfriend. Then, shook her head. "No." She said. "Yes." "No." "Yes." "No." "Please?" Edward begged his love with pouty eyes. He knew they worked on her. "Why?" Bella asked him, a bit upset. "Because I love you…" Edward said as he threaded his fingers through Bella's. She sighed at his cuteness. "Okay…fine…but, you'll have to face Alice's wrath." She said with a smirk. Edward's smile fell. "Alice?"
