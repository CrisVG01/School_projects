Everyone was leaving. "Hey, sleepy head" said Amanda with a smile. "Hey" She replied as silence slipped into the room. "Well, I guess I'll see you later." said Amanda turning to leave. Kikona stood up. "Wait!" She cried, as she grabbed her friend's shoulder. Amanda turned around and looked at Kikona. "Look, I'm sorry for acting like that. I guess I'm just tired." she said quietly. Amanda smiled. "It's ok. I know Cate and Cloe act like total jerks to you 24/ 7. And when they're not after you they're digging down someone else's throat." Kikona smiled, hugging her best friend. "So are we cool?" she asked letting Amanda go. "Like we ever weren't." replied Amanda. "Come on. Lets go home." said Kikona as they walked out of the room. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& It was about five o' clock when they saw the mansion on the horizon. "This is my stop." said Kikona quietly, as Amanda stopped her small silver car at the beginning of the dirt road. "Thanks for the ride." she said, grabbing her backpack from the back seat. "Anytime!" replied Amanda with a smile. Kikona watched as she drove away, before walking up the long road that led to the house. She imagined what her aunt would say, when she walked in late. Aunt Claire would yell and accept no excuses, while the twins grinned evilly. Kikona would probably be grounded. She sighed. Life wasn't fair. Kikona stared blankly at the dirt, till she reached the house. Kikona took a deep breath before unlocking the front door, hoping maybe, just maybe, Aunt Claire would be late from work. "Aunt Claire! I'm home" she yelled. No answer. "Hello!" She closed the door and walked to the kitchen, setting her backpack, keys, and notebooks on a chair as she past. She opened a bottle of cold water, before she noticed a note on the kitchen counter- Kikona, The girls and I went shopping and won't be back till later. Do the chores and all of your homework, including Cate and Cloe's, they just got their nails done and it would be just horrible if anything happened to them. 'Just horrible, I'm sure.' Kikona thought sarcastically before reading the rest. And if you do a good job, I might consider letting you go to that big dance the girls keep talking about. - Aunt Claire Kikona smirked. No aunt Claire or the twins to yell at her for a while, and she may get to go to the fall dance. "I guess things are looking up." she said to herself, grabbing her stuff and walking up stairs to her room. 'I guess I'll do the chores first, then our homework, and then I'll ride Stardust." She thought longingly, wanting, more than anything, to ride her blond mustang. But she knew if she did, before doing any of her chores, she'd probably stay out to long, and Aunt Claire would not only band her from going to the dance, but she'd sell Stardust as well. And if that happened Kikona didn't know what she'd do. Stardust was the last thing her parents had given her before the crash. Stardust was the last, true family Kikona had left. 'Well then. It's settled. I'll do everything first, then ride Stardust." She thought, sitting down at her computer desk. 'But first those reports on Norway and Sweden." Three hours later... Ding! Ding! Kikona quickly ran down the stairs to answer the door. It was probably Aunt Claire and the girls. Thankfully, she had just finished the homework and chores, but not without seeing Stardust in between. "Hurry up, Kikona!" Cloe yelled as Kikona opened the door. Cate handed her two of the most beautiful elegant dresses she had ever seen. "Put those in the girls' closet." said Aunt Claire, not even bothering to say 'hello'. Quietly, she carried out the task, wishing she could have gone. Kikona didn't think she could feel any worse than she already did, when it happened. "Kikona!" Aunt Claire said sharply as she walked down the stairs. She stopped. "Yes?" Aunt Claire stared at her. "Why didn't you start painting the gym?" She asked almost sweetly. Almost. Kikona stared at her blankly. "What do you mean?" she asked, confusion evident in her voice. At this Aunt Claire forced a giggle. "Well what do you think I mean?" Kikona stuttered. "But...But you didn't ask me to." Aunt Claire frowned. "Kikona we took you in when you had no one else. And you can't paint a gym!" she questioned. Kikona knew the real reason Aunt Claire took her in wasn't cause she cared about her, but because she wanted every cent of the fortune her parents had. "I...I didn't know..." she started, but Aunt Claire interrupted. "Kikona, If you couldn't even do that then I guess you can forget about the dance." Cate and Cloe grinned, but that was nothing compared to what was about to happen. "And that stupid animal in the barn, you can say goodbye to her too..." Kikona's heart stopped. Aunt Claire kept talking, but she seemed too far away for her to hear. After everything she had ever gone through from Aunt Claire, this was the absolute worst., and finally she couldn't take it anymore. "You never listen!" Kikona said, continuing down the stairs towards her. Aunt Claire turned around. "What?" she asked. "I said 'You never listen' to me." Kikona said with a new found confidence. "Look, Kikona, All we have to do is sign the papers and they'll send you to boot camp..." Aunt Claire started, but Kikona didn't listen as she went up the stairs, grabbed her purple backpack, and walked out the back glass doors. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& So what do ya think? And yes I want an honest review. Oh and if you gonna be nasty and sarcastic about it don't even bother. I'll post chapter 2 some time next week. If I get reviews I'll post the chapters faster.
