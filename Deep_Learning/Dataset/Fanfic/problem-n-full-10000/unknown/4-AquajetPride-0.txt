listen." He looks as if I just shot him. I turn to Sam and Emily. "Sam I understand if you want to leave but I would really appreciate it if you stayed." "I'll stay. You go, Em." He says. Emily leaves. "Jacob, you broke me. You told me you would never do what he did and then you did. You left me alone and broken. So I don't have to talk to you. I came to talk to you because I would rather get it done now and not have to see you for the rest of my visit. I could have gone straight home and completely ignored Leah and you because I AM NOT YOURS!" I take a deep breath. Before Jake could say a word in response. My phone started ringing. My ringtone was Werewolves in London, so random song Andy found a couple of weeks ago and insisted it be my ringtone. I laughed to myself as I reached for my phone. "One moment, please!" I say to Jacob. I turn away and answer the phone. "Hello." I say quieter then I usually would. "El, you all good? You hung up on us pretty quick. We were worried." Said Marcus. Jacob huffs in disapproval. I glare at him "Oh I'm sorry M. I'm all good." I say reassuringly. "You seen him yet?" He asks cautiously. "He's in the room right now actually." I say unsure of how he would react. "He is what?!" Shouts Connor from the background. "Cool it, Connor." I say with a laugh "Connor?! A guy. Is that your whore of a boyfriend?!" Said Jacob in the worst tone. "I'm all good guys. I'll call you later." I said hanging up on them and turning to glare at Jacob. "First of all," I say crossing the room to be face to face with him. "Who I am or who I am not dating is none of your business. Second of all, no he is not my boyfriend. Third, he is not a whore. He is actually very kind. Fourth, I do have a boyfriend." "Oh so he is your rebound guy. Classy, Bells." He snorts "He is not a rebound guy. Let me tell you a story, 2 months after you broke my heart. I went up to the roof of my dorm. He followed me. Do you know why I went up there?" I ask He just stood there, completely unsure as to why I was telling him this. "I went up there to kill myself." I say. He was shocked. He reaches for my hand. "I'm so sorry, Bells. I didn't realize." "Of course you didn't." I say pulling my hand away. "You were too busy making out with what's her name." "Ann." He says. "What?" I ask "That's her name and I'm not with her anymore." He says hanging his head low. "Why the hell not?!" I ask furious he broke my heart for no reason. "I felt horrible for what I did to you. I couldn't bare to be with her knowing how I hurt you." He says still hanging his head low. "Are you kidding me? You imprinted on her. You are meant to be together. You broke my heart for NO REASON!" I scream. "I…I… I didn't know that's how you felt." He says a bit unsure about himself. Before I could fire an answer back, Seth walked in. "Oh my god, Bella!" He ran over and crashed into me with a big hug. "Oh my god, Bella! I missed you so much. We all missed you." He says hugging me tighter. "I missed you guys too, Seth. Now, I need to breathe."I say with a laugh. He push away quickly, but doesn't let go. "Oh I'm sorry. Wait Bella, why do you smell like other wolves?" Asks Seth confused. Damn it, I think to myself. "Umm… Yeah. Well. That's why I need to speak to the council and Sam." I say trying not to give anything away. "Bells what have you gotten your self into?" Asks Jacob moving to grab my hand again. I pull away and practically hide behind Seth. This angers Jacob. "What? You are ok with Seth touching you, but not the guy you lost it too." He says smug and arrogant. Moving towards me again but this time I couldn't get away. He forcibly grab my wrist and pulled me up against his chest. Then moves his hands around my body tight so I couldn't escape. "Stop, Jacob! Stop!" I yell. After he didn't, Sam and Seth intervened. They pulled him off me. "I'm going to go home." I say shaking. "I'll come with you" says Seth. "Thank you Seth and thank you Sam." I say already out walking out the door. I hoped in my truck and Seth followed pushing me over in to the passenger seat. He starts the car and backs out heading for my home. The drive was quiet. Seth tried to start a conversation, but I didn't go anywhere. We pulled up to my house. As we left the car, Seth began to speck, "We all missed you, Bella. I hope you know that." "I do. I just don't know why none of you reached out to me. Not even a call." I say exhausted. "Jake wouldn't let us. And we knew if we did he would find out." Says Seth sincerely. "Why are you all so afraid of him? Even Sam didn't want to get involved." I say "When it comes to you, Bella. No one can get in his way. You mean so much to him." He say. I simply nod my head and take the keys from him. I walk up the steps and through the front door. "Oh Bella. I missed you!" Says my dad wrapping his arms around me. I hugged back. "I missed you too, dad" I say holding on to him. I didn't realize how much I missed him till now.
