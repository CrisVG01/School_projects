and if he does come all he do is beg for you to run away with him." Peeta sighs. "Oh Catnip, we would have a good life together. I'd take care of you. You don't really love him, you love me." I laugh at his very accurate impersonation of my best friend. "But still, he is my best friend and he would be hurt if I didn't at least extend an invitation." "But Katniss, what if he tries to steal you away?" "Then I'll kick his you know what." I say, punching my left fist into my right. Peeta laughs. "I'll go pick up Rye from school. In the meantime, you should call your mom." "Okay." I say, robotically, dialing the number next to my phone. My mother's residence. "Hello?" Says my mother's voice. It's livelier than I remember. "Mom?" I ask. "I wasn't sure if you'd pick up." My mother doesn't take but a second to reply. "Of course I would you're my daughter and I love you." "You might want to take the next train to District 12." My mother is obviously confused. "Why?" "Me and Peeta are getting married." I say slowly. "Oh that's wonderful Katniss!" Mom says. "I'll take the next train." I swallow. That was easier than I thought. "Before I let you go, Annie is coming too but she needs someone to watch Nick while she helps me plan the wedding." "I'd love to watch him!" She says. "I should go pack. I'll pack for a month?" I nod before remembering that she can't see me. "Yeah, if it takes longer than that, you can use my washer and dryer." My mom pauses. "Alright, I love you Katniss. Goodbye." The line goes dead and I smile. That was easier than I thought. "Mommy?" Willow says. "Yes Baby?" "Are you and Daddy getting Mar-eed?" She asks slowly. I nod. "Yes." Willow's brow creases in confusion. "What's Mar-eed?" "I'll explain it later." The door opens and Peeta and Rye walk in. "Hey Kiddo! How was school?" Rye smiles. "It was good. We learned the first five letters in the alphabet." "That's good Sweetie." Peeta walks to me. "Can I talk to you?" "Sure." We walk to the study and close the door. "Did you call Gale yet?" He asks nervously. I shake my head. "Maybe I should be the one to do it?" "Why?" I ask, confused. Peeta swallows, his adam's apple bobbing up, then down. "He should know but he should also know that he's not to stay in the Victor's Village and that after the wedding, he needs to leave." "Peeta, come on. You're being paranoid." "Katniss, I've had nightmares about this. Where Gale comes and kidnaps you, leaving me all alone." Peeta stutters. "I'm not taking any chances." "Alright. Just be careful." "I will Babe." He says, giving me a kiss. Peeta POV I dial the number next to the phone that's labeled 'Gale'. The phone rings. Once. Twice. Three times before he answers. "Hello?" His gruff voice says on the other side. I swallow. "Hello Gale, it's Peeta." "Oh. Loverboy." "Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that me and Katniss are getting married. I'll let you know when the date is when we figure it out." I say, almost in one breath. Gale pauses. "And the reason you're calling me and not Katniss is?" "Katniss asked me too. She's helping Rye with his homework." I lie perfectly. Gale scoffs. "Oh right, you and Catnip-" "Don't call her that." I growl. "Anyway, you and Katniss had two babies before you got married." He laughs. I take a shaky, calming breath. "Actually, we tried to get married before Rye was born but things didn't work out." "Oh yeah, that's right, you had a little freak out at the word death." He taunted. "Gale, I'm warning you right now, you hurt Katniss in any way, shape, or form, you will pay." I growled. Gale scoffed again. "Oh yes, because a little Loverboy like you can hurt a big strong man like me." "I'll call you when we figure out the date." I say and slam the phone on its cradle. Katniss comes running down the stairs. "Peeta, are you alright?" My breathing becomes shaky and very agitated. "Katniss, I want you to take the kids and go over to Haymitch and Effie's summer house. They always keep a key beneath the doormat." "Okay. Rye, Willow! We're going to stay at Uncle Haymitch's old house." She shouts up the stair. The kids run downstairs with their shoes on and the four of them leave. I sink to the floor and curl my legs up to my chest. That's when the shaking starts. Shaking and flashes of pictures of things that never happened. This is what the Capital did to me. This is not me. This is Capital Peeta. Hijacked Peeta. I squeeze my eyes shut and block out the world. This better not happen at the wedding. It can't happen at the wedding. I won't let it. I have to get these attacks under control before then so that it can happen. Once I get calmed down I stand and grab a cool glass of water. I drink it all in one gulp and splash water from the tap on my face. Then I go over to get Katniss and the kids. I knock on the door, something that feel all too foreign to me. At least at Haymitch's house. Willow opens the door and I smile down at her face. "Hey Willow." "Come in Daddy." She smiles her wide, toothy grin. Katniss jumps up from the armchair by the fire and into my arms. "Are you alright Peeta?" "Yeah, Kat, I'm fine. Well, as fine as I can be." I murmur into her hair. She hugs me tighter, around the neck. My arms tighten around her waist in a protective manner. "I love you so much." "I love you too Peet." Please review!
