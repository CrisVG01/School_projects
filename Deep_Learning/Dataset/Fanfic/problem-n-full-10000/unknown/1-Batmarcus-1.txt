a terrifying thought." "Yeah it is, but I'll be okay." "I'm sure of it. It will start tomorrow." "Okay, thank you Katniss." She said. "You're welcome, Prim." "I love you." She said. "I love you, too." Katniss hugged her close. "It'll be okay." "You think so?" She asked. "Yes I do." "Okay, I trust you." "Good, you should." Katniss said stroking her hair. "Why us?" Prim asked "I don't know." Katniss said with a sigh. "Will we be okay?" "Yes you will. I promise that." "What about you?" "I will." Katniss said really just for her sake. "Okay." She said. Katniss woke up early the next day of course in for her and Haymitch's plan. She was nervous, but ready she knew this had to be done. So she got dressed, braided her hair, and headed over to Haymitch's house. She was surprised he was awake and had a list in front of him. "That everyone we need to get?" She asked coming over. "Yes it is." Haymitch said. "Worked all night on it." He said as she looked it over. "How did you remember all these names?" "I pay a lot more attention than you think. I could never forget anything about any of the children I've mentored." "Oh, I'm sorry." She said. "Not your fault. Besides, pretty much everyone but me and the people on this list had forgotten them completely." "Right, well, where do we start?" "It would make sense to start the closest and make our way towards the Seam." "Okay, so to the Candy Shop first." "Right," Katniss said not realizing the certain string there. "Good come with me." He said. So they both headed out and down the path towards the town. Katniss felt odd about this. She didn't say anything about it though and just kept walking. "Feeling off?" He asked. "A little," She sighed. "It'll be okay. We just need to be careful." "You really think we can do this?" "Of course I do." He said. "Then I can trust that." "Good then, we should be fine." She nodded and just kept walking. They walked into the candy shop which was a small room painted blue. The owner at the counter looked very sullen and scared given the announcement. "Hello." Haymitch said "Oh, hello Haymitch, hello Katniss." "Hello Orion." Haymitch said to the short red haired man "What brings you two here?" "We are her to offer you a deal." Haymitch said. "Alright, what is it?" "We want to train all of you." "Really? But, isn't that illegal?" "Yes but we need to make sure you all have a chance." "What if Thread finds out though?" "He won't find out." Katniss said. "Alright, if you're sure." "We are so are you in?" He nodded, "Yes I am." "Good, see you then." "When's then?" "Soon as we get the others." "Sounds good, where then?" "My house." Haymitch said. "That works, I'll be there." "Good, see you then." With that he and Katniss left Haymitch crossing him off. "Well, the hardest one's out of the way." "How was that hardest?" "Because it was for Maysilee Donner." Haymitch said and Katniss remembered the name from the previous day when her mother mentioned. "It was?" She asked. "Yeah, she was one of my district partners and my ally." "Oh, I'm sorry." Katniss said. "Yeah, if it wasn't for her there'd literally be no way I could have won. She was quite the fighter and even made it to the final five before her throat was skewed by bird mutts. We had split off the alliance before that but the second I heard her scream I went running and had held her hand until she died." "Did you love her?" He hesitated then said, "That's an awkward question to answer since at the time, I had a girlfriend." "Did you though?" "Well… yeah… I guess there was something there." "I am so sorry." "Nothing that can be done about it." He sighed. "I know. I wish there was." Then she realized something, "What ever happened to the girlfriend you did have?" "Hard to explain. Better move on." Haymitch said. "Alright," Katniss agreed seeing that he doesn't want to answer. "Next is the Mayor." "Right," Katniss sighed with a nod. "Come on then." He said. So they both headed over. The Mayors house was slightly larger than most and painted black this time Katniss knocked. A few seconds later Madge opened the door. "Hey Katniss." She sighed. "Hey Madge, can we come in?" "Sure, come on in." She stepped aside and let them in. "So what brings you here?" "We have a plan relating to the Quarter Quell which involves you and your family." "I'm listening." She said carefully. "We're going to train you guys. Everyone eligible for these games." "You think that's a good idea?" "Yes we do. It's about time someone evened the playing field. 1, 2, and 4 have been training their children for decades. Why not us?" "Well, you make a good point." "Exactly, so, you in?" "Yeah, I will get my brother." Katniss nodded as she left and ran right into Madge's brother causing them both to stumble. "Oh! Sorry Katniss." He said. He was about a year older than Prim had olive skin dark red hair and almost impossibly green eyes, and stood at what she guessed was about an inch or two taller than Prim. He also looked worried thinking he might have angered her. "I'm not mad, Measle." She said right away. "Are you sure?" "Yes, I'm sure." Katniss said. "We have a plan with you guys." "What kind of plan?" "We're going to train you guys for if you're reaped." "Is that safe?" He asked. "We'll make sure of it." Katniss insisted. "Okay, I'll be there." "Good, it will be at Haymitch's house." Katniss told them. "Okay, see you then." "See you then." They both nodded and Katniss and Haymitch left. A/N: All reviews are welcome. Thanks for reading.
