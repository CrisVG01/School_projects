when I first phased, but I didn't stop aging. I stayed like that for a whole year. I was so scared. I just ran to Volterra and hid in the shadows. I finally made it to the castle, took down my shield and let Aro look into my mind." "Everyone helped me. They finally tried the happy thought thing and I was naked infront of every vampire there. I ran for it. I got clothes and was okay. I left and traveled. I learn to keep my clothes in a backpack and phase to sleep. I still visit them. I came to America a few years ago." "How old are you?" Edward asked. "I'm not sure. I was born around about two thousand years ago, I think," I told them, as I scratched the top of my head. "Why did you run away instead of fight yesterday?" Emmett asked. "Why fight? If I did then you would have been considered me a 'threat', you would have killed me, and the Volturi would have come. Why would I want you to die?" I asked. "We never thought of that," Carlisle muttered. "Why aren't you in a coven or pack?" Seth asked. "Because any group I join I end up being used," I answered. "What do you mean?" Jacob asked. "Well, one time it was because there was going to be a war. They wanted me to surprise the other coven. Another was to experiment. They wanted to see my weakness and strength. And most of all my looks and powers. They wanted me get their ex-mates jealous. Or they just wanted a good," I stopped. I was going to say "fuck", then I remembered the kids. "They wanted a good time. One night stands. I didn't know. I was taken advantaged of a couple of times. Some covens wanted to fight the Volturi. They wanted me to protect them from Alec's and Jane's powers. I couldn't go against them. They were the only people who treated me like family." "So you've been," Rosalie didn't finish. I knew what she was saying. "Yes. Have you?" I asked. "Once in my human life," she said. "Well you're lucky," I said. "Why?" She asked, confused. "I've been threw it about six times, each with every guy in the coven. Each time is horrible. Yes, once messes with you, but the more times it happens, the worst it gets. After a while you start thinking no one cares. It's not like your loved. Why fight? Maybe they'll kill you and you could leave this cruel world where no one will miss me," I whispered. Everyone was quiet. "So who wants to fight me?" I asked while I jumped to my feet. "Are you bipolar?" Jasper asked. "You know, I've been wondering the same thing," I told him. He laughed. "How about Leah versus Isabella?" Jacob asked. "Bella," I corrected, "so do you want to do it?" "Yeah, maybe I can prove that I'm strong enough," she said I smirked. "Cocky are we," I said. She phased and I went behind a tree and striped. I phased and came out. I walked to Leah and crouched down. She did the same. I lounged and she did too. She tried to reach for my throat, but I didn't let her. I put my shield down. This is fun! I thought. "She thinks this is fun," Edward said, laughing. She got pinned me down and got near my neck. I used my paws to push her off and I pinned her down. I put my teeth on her neck. I win! I thought. I was tackled down. I saw Sam. He was growling. I whimpered. Is he going to kill me? Please tell me, I thought to Edward. "She's scared," Jasper said. Sam growled and snapped his teeth on my face. I whimpered and closed my eyes. I waited for the impact. I opened my eyes and saw Sam walk away from me. I sat up and went to phase back. I put on the clothes and came out. "I'm sorry," I whispered. "Why?" Leah asked. "I don't know. It's just my fault. He didn't get mad for nothing," I said. "Oh he does," Jacob answered. I smiled. I sat down and looked at everyone interact. Jacob sat down next to me. "This is your whole pack?" I asked. "No, one person is. Paul, he couldn't make it," he told me. I smiled at him. "Who's the fastest?" I asked. "Me and Edward," he said. "A race. You, me, and Edward," I told him. "You're on," he said. "Count me in," Edward said, as he ran to us. We went to the end of the forest. "Okay run from here to the Edward's house and back," I said. I went to phase, Jacob did too. "Ready, set, go!" Emmett said. We were off. I wasn't going that fast and I was tied with them. We were going back when I got bored. I ran my fastest speed. I put my clothes back when Edward and Jacob finished. "Nice, slow pokes," I said. Chapter 2: Staying At The Cullens: "So I stay here for this week?" I asked. "And next week?" "Yeah, and next week you go with the pack," Alice told me. "I stay here or the dog house?" I asked. "Where ever you want," Carlisle said. "So um tell me about Forks," I said. "It's cool. So uh, we registered you to Forks High School for the beginning of next month," Alice told me. "You did what?" I asked. "Your going to high school in two weeks," she said. "You know I've never been in school my whole life?" I asked. "What if they hate me? What if I mess up? What if I..." Alice interupted me by slapping my face. "They loose their temper fast," Emmett said. Sorry it's been like forever that I've updated! I've got anew story out. Witness Protection Program (A Bella/Sam story)
