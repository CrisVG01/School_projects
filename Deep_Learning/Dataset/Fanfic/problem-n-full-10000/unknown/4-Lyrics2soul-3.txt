make love to you so bad. Do you want me to keep going?" "What an unfair question," I moaned. He stopped moving inside me and gazed in my eyes. My breathing quickened. I swore I saw the next nine months pass by my eyes and saw what our baby would look like if I kept this up. I bit my bottom lip again and nodded my head yes. "I want you… all of you," I moaned, against my better judgment. "I just wanna tell you that I also believe that life starts at conception," he whispered. I let out a weird murmur and my leg started trembling. I guess my body was freaking out that I was deciding to do this. All of this was so crazy. I'm basically agreeing to have this man's child if he gets me pregnant. Jacob's child. My walls contracted at the thought of it like I was having a mild orgasm. I passionately kissed him and gripped his hair. "Damn Baby," he breathed in my ear. "But I'm gonna make you come harder than that." He thrust inside me at a medium speed. I gasped out loud inside his mouth. "Jacob!... Ohhh… Mmm… Oh shit," I moaned. He bit my neck and licked my ear. He stayed near my ear and moaned over and over. "Ahhh Jacob… Oh my God… you feel so good... too good. Ahhh… Oh... Jake what are we doing?" "Making love and possibly making… a baby," he breathed. My eyes rolled back in my head. My body actually liked the sound of that. I was completely out of control. I didn't even feel like my weight was on the bed. I felt like I was floating… hovering over the bed like some crazy science fiction movie. "Would you want… would you want that," I breathed. "Yes," he hissed. "Jacob," I moaned. "Yes Baby." "I… I think I love you." Oh my God. I just told him that I think I'm in love with him. Maybe it was a moan of passion. That seems to happen to people when they're getting fucked really well. Well this was more than well . This was a life changing experience. Maybe I am in love with him? Wow… I dare to say that I am. I love him. This is absolutely crazy. "I will make it my mission for you to know that you love me," he said. "Oh Jacob," I breathed. He thrust deeper still keeping a medium pace. "Oh shit!... Fuck… Awwww," I said as I felt myself reaching my climax. "I love you Nessie," he groaned. "I love you too." "Yeah?" He started pumping faster. I started screaming louder. I'm so glad our house is secluded or my neighbors would have been ratting me out. "Baby, do me a favor," he moaned. "Anything." If he wanted me to suck his dick or fuck me in the ass… I was down for it. Well maybe not the ass part… he's a big man. "I want you to moan I love you over and over… and when you come… I want to scream my name." "Ok," I breathed. This wasn't an off the wall request. I was happy to moan these things to him. He pounded harder. It was driving me crazy. "I love you… I love you … I love you," I moaned over and over with each breath. He grabbed my hips and pulled me onto him making me feel him more. I felt like my pussy was being abused… but I liked it. I've never been fucked like this before. There was no room inside me. His girth was probably stretching me, come to think of it. If I wasn't soaking wet… this probably would have been extremely painful. Then it hit me like a truck. I was coming on his dick. "Jacob!" I screamed as he requested. I probably would have screamed his name regardless. "Jacob… Jacob… Jacob," I continued as the waves were crashing over me. He thrust deeper and harder grunting with each movement. Then I felt his come squirt deep inside me. It gushed out of me soaking my bed even more. "Ahhhh!" he groaned. "Fuck! Oh my God!" I was trembling at this point. My thighs… my hands… I was trying my best not to hyperventilate. Then it felt like my entire body was vibrating. My teeth started chattering and I looked up at him. He was panting really hard looking down on me. The way he looked at me almost made me wanna cry. I never saw someone looking at me this way. It made my heart hurt. "I love you so much," he breathed. "It was destiny that I was here today. Who would have thought that I would have met the most amazing woman? I was actually going to take off today… but I'm glad I didn't; so glad." My breathing was still heavy and my thoughts were disjointed. "Jacob…" I breathed. "Yes Nessie." "We were very bad today." "What do you mean by that… I think we were very good today. Excellent I would say," he said obviously being sarcastic. "You know what I mean. The possible… um… The possibility of you..." "What… making a baby with the most beautiful woman in the world." I smiled… but it was a nervous one. "Yeah," I said faintly. "Well… there's only one stipulation with that." What in the world is he talking about? A stipulation? He just… I mean… I agreed… but he didn't make it easy for me. Now he's adding a stipulation. I was afraid to ask but I asked anyway. "What?" I breathed. "I'm not into having the whole baby mama drama… you will have to be my wife." A thrill rushed through my body and I let out a quiet moan. "Ok," I breathed. "Yes?" I nodded my head as he leaned in to kiss me. "You can change my last name to Black," I moaned. "I plan to."
