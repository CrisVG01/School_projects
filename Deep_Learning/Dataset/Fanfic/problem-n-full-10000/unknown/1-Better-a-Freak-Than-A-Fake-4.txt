way up over time." Clove sighed. "Okay, that is not too bad." "No, it's still bad that it is though." "Oh sorry." He said. "Again, it's not your fault." "Right, I will try to stop that." "It would be best to try but I wouldn't be mad if you do." "You wouldn't?" He asked. "No I wouldn't. I promise." "How odd." He said. "It isn't to me." "Is to me. I was told you do or you fail." "Well, that isn't true." "It always seemed true." He pointed out. "Well, you never really knew anything different." Clove said with a sigh. "I suppose not." He said. "When that's the case anyone's going to believe it." "Even you?" "Yes, even me. Kind of like how in the Capitol everyone's taught how amazing and wonderful the Hunger Games are their whole lives so they all believe it. You could make anyone believe anything if you isolate them from anything else." "Yeah, that makes sense." He said. "You trust me then?" "Why would I not?" "Because it must be very difficult for you to trust anyone." "I trust you." He said. "You, Cato, Cady, and Enobaria; those are who I trust. Cady was the only one that knew about what Mom and Dad were doing. She tried to tell people but knowing believed her and after a while I asked her not to." "She knew and you asked her not to tell anyone?" "I didn't want to burden anyone else with my own problems." "Kawino, you could have told me." "Look what happened when you did find out though." "I know but you are my brother I worry." "I don't want you to worry though." "I know but siblings worry about each other." "You shouldn't have to. You deserved to just be happy." He said to her. "No one is happy all the time." "You deserved to be as much as you could though." "Well, most times I am." "Not now that you know the truth though." He pointed out. "I will be happy when you get better." "What if I don't though? What if I'm just too far gone?" "You're not. Do not talk like that." "It will certainly take time, Clover. Lots of time." "I know, but you have me and mom now," She said. "Is having Mom supposed to somehow make me feel better?" He asked looking at her. "Not sure, but she seems to really care about you now." He snorted slightly and said, "It's obviously just a trap." "Kawino, they are about to get divorced over this. I can understand your thoughts but I think this time it's not." "There must be some other reason. That woman does not by any means deserve one bit of my trust." "I know she does not, but I think she is going to." "What do you mean?" "I mean we don't need to trust her yet but in this instance I do not think she is lying." "Well, I guess we don't really have any other choices." "No, we really don't." Clove said. "Well, I guess that's nothing new." He sighed. "You have me now." "I've always had you. If I didn't I would have killed myself years ago." "You would have?" She asked. "Probably, I'd have to have something worth living for." "Well then, we need to get you friends." She said hugging him. "What are those?" He asked returning the hug. "People you like to hang out with that are not family." "Hang out?" He asked even more confused and now a little scared obvious knowing what hang means just not the idiomatic phrase. "It means spend time doing fun things with." She said. "Oh, well, there's Cato, Cady, and Enobaria." "Yeah, that's a good." Clove said. "It would still help to have more though." She added. "Okay, I guess." "Trust me, it really will help. You just of course still have to be careful." "Why?" "Since, as you clearly already know, there are bad people out there." "Yeah, I do." He said. "Well, that's why you still have to be careful. Not all bad people are adults and as you've seen with Enobaria, not all adults are bad people." "Okay, so don't trust anyone?" "No, just not everyone and not right away. I can help you with that." "You can?" He asked. "Yes and I'd be glad to." "Deal," he said as their mother returned. As you'd imagine neither of them even wanted to look at her. "We need to go." She said awkwardly. "Where?" Clove asked. "We'll have to figure that out but for now just out." Mantear said looking at the bag of coins rightfully hers from her pay as a trainer. "Okay?" They said confused. "Won't we still have to come back soon for training though?" Kawino asked based off of when the other students would arrive. "I can call you both in or you can go up to you both." "I'm going." Kawino said simply. "Are you sure?" She asked worried. "Yes, I'm sure." He said still not looking at her. "Well, if you insist." "Kawino, I don't think you should." Clove said carefully. "What? Why not?" "Clearly your body desperately needs a break from training. At least for the day." "I don't want a break." "Kawino please, it will really help you get better." "But if I do not go I won't see Cady." "You could surprise her when she comes out." Clove offered. "I suppose..." He said. "So you will then?" She asked hopefully. "Okay, if you say so." He said. "Only if you do too though." He bargained give her cracked rib. "Fine deal." She said. See? Very shocking. I honestly hope you guys liked it but it's okay if you didn't. Please review and let us know.
