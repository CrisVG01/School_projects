I am glad that my clothing changes with me.

I choose to wear a blue bikini with short blue jean shorts. My rings on my fingers were one of the few things that never changed. Turning to look at them the looks of shock on most of their faces was comical. The only one who was staring at me straight faced was Nico. He had this look in his eye that betrayed his own amusement, he was not allowing it to colour his face./span/p p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;" /p p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;""span style="font-size: 11pt;"I think you should wear that form."

Annabeth mutters. She shoots me this look as we wander to where the Big House was. My heart is racing I am trying to remember to take deep breaths. I do not really want to be here. I do not get along well with other kids my age normally. I just do not understand the little groupings they tend to do and how they treat others. These are people you could end up on a quest with yet they treat each other so shabbily. Annabeth opens the door to the Big House and we all walk in. I hope the adults here are not going to be as bad about things as the other teen-agers were going to be. Well it be a wait and see game I knew that.

If he was here he had to be one of the good ones. I also wonder who this Mr D is? He must be a god.
