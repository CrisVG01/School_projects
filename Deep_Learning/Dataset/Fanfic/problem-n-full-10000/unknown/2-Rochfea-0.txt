was happening. That simple call distracted her enough to be hit across the stomach by the man's blade. Dinera went down on her knees, but refused to give into the pain. Rising slowly she went after the man who was about to attack Celeborn. At the absolute second she brought her sword down upon the man's back sending him to the ground. Celeborn stood stunned when the man came at him full force with an evil smile. Before he could even react the man's face changed to one of shock and fell to the ground. All the silver haired lord saw then was Dinera clutching her sword in one hand and her stomach with the other. Celeborn wasted no time and called for the nearest guard. "Quickly find a healer!!" The guard ran for a healer while the elven lord picked up Dinera, much to her distaste, and ran after him. The corridors soon came alive from the disturbance Celeborn was making. By the time the silver haired elf reached the Healing House a following had quickly formed made of the king, Arwen, the Galadrium brothers and Legolas. The healer had to push everyone out of the room but Aragorn and Celeborn. ****************** An hour past slowly for those in the waiting area till the door opened and a very reluctant elven lord was pushed out. The other four elves swarmed towards him to get any information they could. When all settled Celeborn began, "Dinera fought what I guess was an assassin and was cut across the stomach. The wound is deep and Aragorn and the healer are still working on her." Hours passed but there was still no word. Finally Aragorn and the healer came out to see the restless elves. The healer walked away grim faced which worried Celeborn. He did not wait Aragorn's report; he rushed past the king to see for himself. Mean while the King of Men looked towards the rest of the group and shook his head. Arwen immediately went to him and began to cry. The other three elves huddled together in a supportive hug. ******************** Celeborn walked into the room as if afraid to wake Dinera. He knelt by the bedside holding her hand and crying. He stayed there for hours. It took both Rumil and Orophin to pull him away from her body. "We shall leave tomorrow, no questions." Celeborn declared after he had calmed down. No one argued they all just left the room for their own chambers hoping for rest. Chapter 17 Farewell The time finally came for the Lorien elves to leave. Before they left Rumil made sure all of Dinera's belongings were within the packed supplies. He noticed her sword was missing. He ran towards the gardens before anyone could stop him. There he searched through the bushes were Celeborn said the attack took place. It took him sometime but eventually found it and walked back towards the horses without looking or addressing the questioning faces. He mounted his horse with the sword attached to his hip and waited for the others. Celeborn mounted with the body of Dinera before him and Orophin led her horse with all of their gear attached. *********************** Their journey was short for Celeborn and determined to reach Lothlorien quickly so he may grieve in peace. When they reached Lorien, Rumil and Orophin took it upon themselves to prepare the body for burial. They made sure she was garbed in the cloths of a Lorien guardian. The brothers also gathered her weapons to be buried with her, all but the sword Rumil wore. For this he had a special stone created for it to be mounted upon. The last thing they made sure was placed in her hands was the flute she always played. It took some time for the two silvered elves to find it among her things, but when they did a piece of parchment fell to the ground. Rumil grabbed it first before Orophin had a chance to get it. Before he could read it though Celeborn approach them and said, "It is time." nothing else. Celeborn led the way as the guardian brothers took an end of the pallet. The silver lord led them to a place next to the grave of Haldir. Here they buried one of the greatest guardians of Middle Earth. Finally Rumil had a chance to open the piece of parchment and realized it was a song she had written. Not caring what the others thought he began to sing the words. Where has the starlight gone? Dark is the day How can I find my way home? Home is an empty dream Lost to the night Why do I feel so alone You promised you'd be there Whenever I needed you Whenever I called your name You're not anywhere I'm trying to hold on Just waiting to hear your voice One word, just a word will do To end this nightmare When will the dawning break Cold endless night Sleepless I dream of the day When you were by my side Guiding my path But now, I can't find the way When he reached the end he realized it was unfinished and left it that way. When he finished, Rumil chose now would be the best time to place the mounted sword between the grave of Haldir and Dinera. The sword now had a new inscription upon it. Haldir e≈Ñ Lothlorien. A'mael, toror', utihu, meldir, cora ( Haldir of Lothlorien, Beloved brother, son, friend, leader) Elaman Dinera, Tel'dina vakka en' Arda ( Elaman Dinera, The silent guardian of Middle Earth) Finally Dinera has found the peace and joy in death, which she could not in life. Reunited with her family in the Halls of Mandos. Here ends the story of Dinera, the Silent Star. A story of lose, loneliness, discovery, and love. As for the three remaining silvered elves, they swore never to let her story be forgotten, and it has not been.
