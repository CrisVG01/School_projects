strict policy of keeping the highest level of propriety between masters and servants." Lucius bent down and whispered in her ear, "I don't have such a problem, as you can see." She tore away from him, her eyes wide. 'That voice,' she thought, 'That gait and that figure… he was the man with the mask! The one who killed my family!' "Is anything the matter?" asked Severus, appearing in the doorway. "Not at all," said Lucius, taking a step back and bowing politely. "I was just leaving. But, just so you know, Severus, you must truly be blind if you don't see it." He looked pointedly at the flowers and then back at Hermione before departing. "I see no difference," Severus murmured, looking around the room. He then turned to look at Hermione. "Did he bother you? I apologize. My friend can be rather bold with the servants." Hermione flushed. "No, nothing happened." She excused herself and went straight to her room to contemplate what she'd learned about the man in the mask… no… Lucius Malfoy. "I see that Lucius had his eye on you, if you try anything funny with him, you'll have me to answer to!" Lady Bella said to her two days later. Hermione shook her head. "You can have him. I do not care." Her answer didn't seem to satisfy Bella and, over the next couple of weeks, she became increasingly vicious. Whilst Lucius grew bolder in his untoward advances. Hermione began to suspect them of working together. As the weeks went on, Hermione became certain that they had something planned. At first, she wondered if Lucius recognized her, but if that were true surely he would already have silenced her. Hermione came to the conclusion that Lucius was fixated on her because she was the only maid who spurned him, it sent shivers of revulsion down her spine. She feared, if he couldn't have her willingly, he'd force her instead. She began to dread Malfoy's ever-increasing visits. Still, though he gave her no indication that he cared for her, Severus, (though she called him that only in her head), made sure to be there each time Lucius visited. One day, however Mr Malfoy caught her alone. Hermione was miserable. It was all her fault. The night before, Severus had finally asked her about the flowers. Lady Bellatrix had pointed them out to him- he still hadn't noticed them on his own. "They're for you," she'd answered from the heart. "All for you. As am I." At hearing her admission, he'd gone mad. He'd shouted at her about the audacity of her words and the sheer impropriety of her actions, before dashing the vase against the wall and storming out of the house. And now… now he wasn't here to protect her. Bellatrix leered from the doorway as Lucius descended upon Hermione, grinning evilly. "Well, well, well if it's not Miss de Flora, the untouchable maid! How the mighty have fallen. It would be quite a letdown to your parents, don't you think? It must be a relief that they're dead." At her terrified look, he smiled coldly. "Did you think I wouldn't recognise you? Girl, you're identical to your mother!" He had her cornered, his fingers twisting tightly around her arms. At that moment, a furious Severus entered the room. "What do you think you're doing?" he hissed, tossing Lucius aside. "Leave, now !" Lucius fled. "What happened?" Severus stared at her with worried eyes. Hermione broke down and told him everything, from her parents death to her learning who Lucius was. Then she recounted what had happened before his arrival. Finally she sobbed an apology as she confessed the depth of her feelings for him. "No, it's not fair for you to take the blame. I should have been here tonight. I'm sorry. I never thought anyone would come to care for me as you do. I don't trust easily but I think in time I may come to trust you. I promise, I will do everything in my power to make him pay for your parents' death and for everything that he has done to you." " Almost done," she whispered, but he didn't hear her. He was looking at the flowers in the vase. "Why do you bring fresh flowers into the house each day?" he asked her. "Because they are a symbol of my love for you. That's how I met you. With a flower. " He smiled. "Yes, I remember. Who would have thought that little servant girl I met back then was the lost girl of the de Flora family? In truth, you are richer than me!" Hermione blushed. "I don't think I am any longer. I am sure my riches are lost." Severus shook his head. "You are. The king has refused to let anyone touch your money and properties unless it was proven that you were dead. He had never lost hope that you would be found." "Well, he's going to get quite a shock when he sees that I'm back!" she exclaimed. When she tried to take his hand, however, he recoiled as though he'd been burnt and stood to leave. After that, he hadn't looked at her or smiled, but she knew he cared. He had saved her from Lucius and he had promised to make him pay for her parents' death. He could ignore her all he wanted, he could shout and scream and threaten her all day for tiny offenses, but he wouldn't succeed in pushing her away. She loved him, and she knew deep down he loved her too. In time, perhaps she would succeed in melting the walls he had built around himself and make him trust her. She would make him see she wasn't going to leave if it was the last thing she did. With these thoughts in her head, she put a single red rose in the vase. To think everything had started and ended with a flower.
