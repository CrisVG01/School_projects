she didn't have one thought of possibly dating him she saw him as a little brother already nothing more nothing less. O ndáiríre labhraíonn tú Gaeilge (O really you speak Irish) came her voice sending pleasent tingles down Percy's back Bheadh Ní hamháin Gaeilge ach Iodáilis agus Fraincis mhaith leat anois a bheith ag gabháil dom a lón (Not just Irish but Italian and French now would you like to accompany me to lunch) She was shocked that he actually could but bent down a little and looped her arms through his walking out the cabin arriving at the dinning pavilion she saw her boyfriend Sam smiling at her and wordlessly asking who was the kid on her arms she mouthed out "New bro" Sam just smiled and mouthing back "Cute" she gave him a look that said I know right. When they got to their table Percy sat down next to Brook,he saw that you had to wish for your food he wished for deep fried guinea pigs and it appeared on his plate causing everyone at the table to scream. "Hun what are you eating" asked Brook in her sweetest voice I looked up at her with a guinea Pig head in my mouth after swallowing it whole "it's a guinea pig I remember when I was 5 one bit me" then Percy did a little dance and went back to eating before he added "I never forget and I never forgive" before sending glares at everyone at the table. Everyone was a little scared now not wanting to get on his bad side, Brook informed him that he has to give half his food to his godly parent he got up and puts the food Into the grill and thought of his father not Poseidon. The night was coming to an end and everyone was gathered around the fire listening to songs sung by campers Annabeth decided to get her own revenge for Percy not helping her because after the last song while everyone was clapping she raised her voice "Hey guys Percy can sing" Percy who was snuggled on Brooks lap got up and glaring at the blonde not wanting her to win he turned asking for a drummer and a bass player two hands rose one who was Sam he is a son Aphrodite and Brook's boyfriend he raised his hands for drums and another was Chris a son of Apollo Percy just grunting asked they if knew any fall out boy they both did, Percy told them not to screw up he was trying to impress Brook. Say my name and his in the same breath I dare you to say they taste the same Let the leaves fall off in the summer And let December glow in flames (flames) They're all shocked by Percy's voice even the Apollo kids were shocked Erase myself and let go Start it over again in Mexico These friends, they don't love you They just love the hotel suites now I, don't, care what you think as long as its about me The best of us can find happiness in mi-i-i-isery I, don't, care what you think as long as it's about me The best of us can find happiness in misery I'll take a chance let your body get a tolerance I'm not a chance put a heatwave in your pants Pull a breath like another cigarette Pawnshop heart trading up; trading up I'm the oracle in my chest Let the guitar scream like a fascist Sweat it out, shut your mouth, free love on the streets But, in the alley it ain't that cheap, now I, don't, care what you think as long as it's about me The best of us can find happiness in mi-i-i-i-sery Said I, don't, care what you think as long as its about me The best of us can find happiness in misery (OH) (OH) 'Said I, don't, care just what, you, think; as long as i-it's about me 'Said I, don't, care just what you think as long as i-i-it's about me I said I don't care (I don't care) I said I, don't care (I don't care) 'Said I, don't, care I, don't, care (No, I don't) I don't care (Said, I don't care) I said, I don't (don't) care (care) I don't, care, what you think as long as its about me The best of us can find happiness in mi-i-i-isery I said I, don't, care what you think as long as its about me The best of us can find happiness in mi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-isery When the song was over their were loud applause's everywhere followed by a lot of screaming for an encore Percy was tired by the end of the song and said maybe tomorrow all the while Percy was thinking this whole camp thing can be fun. Tuath a Dé Danann "My king your son is the topic of much excitement to those Greek children" came the soft voice of a beautiful red haired women with jaw dropping yellow eyes she wore a smile while talking fondly of her Kings son. "he is isn't he Scáthach" came an ancient voice a voice that told a thousand tales each just as interesting as the last but the voice isn't what was intriguing about this deity but his aura, and the large hound that sat at his feet the old deity reached down and pets the hound softly "you can't wait for your friend can you Failinis" the king asked while the hound barked at a picture of a boy with green eyes that were shining with the light of a million suns. That hound of mightiest deeds, Which was irresistible in hardness of combat, Was better than wealth ever known, A ball of fire every night. Other virtues had that beautiful hound (Better this property than any other property), Mead or wine would grow of it, Should it bathe in spring water. Revising my work my dudes
