My cell rings again getting the best of me and I let out a growl before taking it out of my pocket and answering with a hiss. "What!" I spat. "Edward?! Are you Ok?" A frantic Alice asks taking me by surprise. "Uhm… yes, I'm fine why wouldn't I be?" My anger falters at her tone. "It's just… I saw…" "What Alice? What did you see?" "Edward?" That was Carlisle "Where are you?" "Came for a run, I told you. What's going on?" "I need you to come home, now ." "I'm on my way." I said, already going as fast as my feet would let me "What's the matter?" "Edward? Please don't do anything stupid." Alice cried taking the phone from Carlisle. "What?! What are you talking about?" "You disappeared… please Edward, I know it hurts but… don't do this to us! Think of Bella!" I winced at the mention of her name. "Whoa whoa whoa! Hold on a sec… what are you talking about?" I say as I jump over a slope. "You… you weren't going to Volterra?" "Why in the hell would I want to go to Volterra?" I ask incredulous. "Alice, I won't provoke the Volturi, we have talked about this… I'm not stupid… that time with James was whole other different scenario." "Well… then I don't understand… you… you disappeared…" She said confusedly. "You still can't see me?" "I don't know… it's all blurry… come home, now. Emmett and Jasper will meet you half way." "I'm on my way." I say before I end the call. What the hell? Three minutes later I hear my brother's thoughts before I even smell them. " Edward…" Jaspers sighs in relief "you gave us quite a scare, Esme thought you had decided to go to Italy." I rolled my eyes. "It never crossed my mind, I swear. I don't know what's going on." " Where were you?" He asked as he flanked my right. "Around." I say as Emmett jumps to run to my left. " The hill again?" I ignore his question, he already knows the answer. A few minutes later, my brothers and I jump into the back garden of our huge house at the limits of Anchorage and they all meet us there. "Edward!" Esme's cries "You scared us! What has gotten into that big brain of yours?" She chastised me at the same time she throws her arms around me. "I swear I don't know what's going on… I was just around." "So you are not going to Volterra?" Alice asks looking even more confused when she realizes I'm telling the truth. "I swear… what did you see Alice?" "Nothing… I mean, you are there but you are not at the same time… I can't see you that clearly…" She explains with her eyes out of focus. "Let's all go inside." Carlisle says calmly but I could feel his eyes studying me. " He seems to be saying the truth… I hope he is…" "Carlisle, I'm not going to Volterra." It wouldn't be fair to her… I made her promise she wouldn't do anything reckless, I thought I would do the same. " Maybe Victoria is coming back…" "Victoria?" I turn to Jasper. "It's a possibility… you killed her mate, maybe she's is seeking revenge?" "No that's not it…" Alice whispers still looking into the future. "Besides… it's seven of us against just her. She doesn't stand a chance." Emmett adds. "But what other threat could be out there for him to disappear?" Esme musses worriedly. "It's not that… I can see now he's not in danger but… agh! Don't know but this is giving me a headache… is that even possible with vampires?" Alice whines as Jaspers rubs her back soothingly. "Alice… try to see further into the future… can you see him at all?" Carlisle inquires. "I can see him… but only tiny bits… it's not him making this, something's changing. Someone or something's undecided." "Keep a close eye… we need to know if he's in danger." "Of course…" Alice answers slowly, her eyes studying me close. "Maybe we should call the Denali's, if Edward is in danger it means we won't be enough to help him." Emmett interjects. "Is not that… this is different, he is there… I just can't see him." "How do you know he'll be Ok if you can't see him?" Esme asks. "Because I know… it's something else." "So there's no threat?" "No." "Then why can't you see me?" I asked frustrated. "I don't know!" … … "Is… is she in danger?" I ask with my heart on my throat. "I don't know." " I'm afraid to look." She thought in spite of herself. "Look." I urge through greeted teeth. "Edward… I'm sure she's fine." "LOOK!" I yell and everyone startles at my sudden outburst. Alice makes a pained face before closing her eyes and looking into the future and… there she is. Sitting on a rocking chair… looking out of a window, but I frown at what I see… she's pale, thinner than I remember… beautiful as ever but still she looks sick. Her eyes are hollowed and empty… the image breaks me and I fall to my knees. "What? What did you see?" Esme asks desperately. "She's alright… although, I think she's sick… she looks thin… and sad." "But… she's alive, she's there right?" Esme asks with big eyes. "Yes… she seems Ok…" "Keep an eye on her." I hear myself say. "I… I want know if she'll be Ok." I say ignoring what I had been debating with myself earlier about peeking. "Ok." Alice responds softly "But she is there so don't worry." "Still." And with that I go upstairs to my room, blocking all thoughts from my family. I know the start is a little like One More Chance, but believe is going to be veeery different, for instance... Edward is a vampire ;) Please let me know what you think! Saludos! tpec
