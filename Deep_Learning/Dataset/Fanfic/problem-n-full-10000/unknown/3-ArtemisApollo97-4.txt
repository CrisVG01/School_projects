Your father is in the car now; we want you to come home." Joe's smile vanished instantly. "I… I can't… I can't do that, not… not since…" "I won't let him hurt you." "But he might hurt you. Mom, don't… I've seen you flinch, I've seen what happens, I'm not stupid." "Wait, I'm callin' time." "Lou!" "No, hold up." Louisa waved Leo away. "Uh, Meghan. I figured you 'n' Harrison weren't on great husband-wife relations, but he ain't… has he hit you?" "No! He just… has a temper and sometimes things get broken, he'd never hit me!" "But he hit Joe." "That was years ago and only the once." Even to Meghan her argument sounded weak. "Look, I'll be frank with you- ya get on my nerves. But I ain't gonna stand by 'n' let someone be bullied. He may not be hittin' you, but his breakin' things 'n' temper tantrums are signs that he wants to hit you." "No, that's not…" "True? I wish." Louisa dragged a hand over her face, thinking furiously. "Valdez." "Mm?" Leo pressed a hand to the small of Louisa's back. She looked at him over her shoulder and a silent conversation passed between them. "She can have one of the girls' old rooms." "How about that then?" "What?" "I'll drive you 'n' Twatface back 'n' you can pack some overnight stuff for you 'n' Joe." "You… you want me to stay here?" "I know it's not as posh as what you're used to," Leo smiled, resting a gentle hand on her shoulder, "but at least you're not in a toxic environment." "Why- I don't understand, why are you doing this?" "Because we're nice people." Leo cleared his throat. "Excuse me?" Louisa looked at him challengingly. "There, proves my point. Meghan, we help people where we can. We both know what it's like to be… to be on the outside looking in. Joe needed our help, here we are. You need our help, it's there if you want it." "I… what about Harrison?" "I can take care of him." "No." Leo grabbed Louisa's hand. "No." He repeated firmly. "Leave him at home. We'll sort Meghan and Joe out first." "Ya know, I didn't really expect for things ta go like this tonight. We've got Jolie and we're stickin' up for Meghan . You put somethin' in my hot chocolate, didn't ya?" She wagged an accusing finger in Leo's face. Leo laughed and pushed her hand down, lacing their fingers. "If I did, it would have been sedatives. Are you alright, Meghan?" "M-me?" "Yes. We only know one Meghan." "I… um… I t-thi-think so?" Joe furrowed his brow, watching his mother in confusion. Meghan didn't look any of them in the eye, tucking her hair behind her ear. "You're so human." "Excuse me?" "Without his lordship around, you're human ." Louisa poked Meghan's shoulder. "I always swore blind you were some kind of robot or somethin'." "OK?" "I'm thinkin' if we keep you 'n' Fatty apart, you'd be a pretty decent person." Louisa looked to Leo, who nodded once in agreement. Meghan wrung her hands nervously. Louisa grinned. "I like me a project. Valdez, get the duct tape." "You are not allowed duct tape." "Says who?" "Says me." "Irrelevant." "Relevant." Leo half-turned, pushing his son's bedroom door open. "Charlie, you can come out now." "I did that years ago." "No. Come out of your room, not the closet." "Oh. Right." Charlie wiggled under his father's arm and smiled. "So, I hear Meghan is staying here too?" His parents nodded. "On one condition- she stops calling him Joseph, it's so weird." "And Josephine isn't?" Meghan retorted. "Ooh. You're right." He told his parents. "More human without the baggage." Charlie considered this new opponent. "Keep this up and we could be friends." "No thank you." "She secretly likes that idea, you secretly like that idea, I can see it on your face. You can't not be friends with me, I'm awesome and lovable. Very lovable." He smiled angelically. Joe laughed. "Don't trust a word he says, Mom." Joe advised. "He's not as innocent as he looks." "Innocent until proven guilty!" Charlie declared. "Proven guilty about ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine-" Louisa went on and on and on until she had to draw breath, blowing a raspberry at her son. "May as well round it up to a hundred." "No." Charlie stuck his bottom lip out. Louisa messed his curls, smiling. "Sleepover!" "Joe's sleeping in Kia's old room." "Wait, what?" Charlie sulked. "I don't think Meghan can handle Jolie just yet." Leo laughed. "And she hasn't met your sisters yet either." "Lots of Valdez!" Louisa grinned, throwing her hands up. "But your son." "Your son." "If neither of you want me, I'll go and see Frank. He'll have me." "I highly doubt that, but be my guest." Leo caught his son in a headlock, blowing a raspberry on his cheek. Charlie wailed in protest, wiggling to get free. "No way out of it." "Mama!" Charlie looked at her desperately. "Mama, tell him!" Louisa held her hands out and Leo let go. Charlie barrelled into his mother's arms and hid his face in her shoulder. "He's mean, Mama. Tell him off." "Bad Valdez. Go sit in the corner 'n' think 'bout what you've done." "No." "Eh. I tried." Louisa shrugged, rubbing circles into her son's shoulders. "Mama's boy." Joe smirked. "Demon." Charlie stuck his tongue out. "You lot are very strange." Meghan commented. Leo and Louisa grinned at each other and then Leo held his hand out. "Welcome to the Valdez life. You'll get used to it." OK, I know I said this was a one-shot, but it turned into a story. Sort of. I've spent about seven hours on this. I just sort of rolled with it and I'm quite happy with the Leoisa in this as well ^_^ Also, I have a thing up- Headcanons of the Arty Universe - go and check it out! :D
