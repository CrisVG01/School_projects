college and was actually looking forward to the future. I still ached when I thought about him, and my breathing still felt shallow, but I was getting closer and closer to being okay. "What exactly are you sorry for, Edward? For continually stringing me along for the last two and a half years? For letting me believe I stood a chance? Or are you sorry that I found out that you moved on?" "Bella, Baby, you don't get it. I love you, and I have always loved you. I don't want to let you go." His voice trembled as he spoke. "Please let me go. Please, please let me go," I begged, knowing it was the only way I'd ever be free from him. I held my breath, trying to keep the tears at bay. I'd been so good for months, and now the love of my life was begging to see me. I didn't want to need him, but I did. "Please," he begged. "Please come see me next weekend. Mom and Dad will be gone so we'll have the house to ourselves. We can talk. Not seeing you for all these months has really woken me up, Baby." Needless to say, I drove the five hours from my new home in Atlanta to the Cullen home the following Friday. You opened the door the minute I pulled into the driveway, and you looked genuinely excited to see me. My heart restarted that day, and for the next two years, we took turns making the journey. There were weekends we met halfway, and weekends you came to me. I never suspected a thing. I never questioned why we never saw your parents anymore, and Emmett had his own life, so we lost touch, or so I thought. *****Reckless***** The picture of the two of you is gorgeous: a beautiful blonde staring up at you and you looking back at her with such reverence, the love so obvious. All I can think is "Why can't it be me?" I wonder if she knows what desperation feels like. Even though she has you, I hope she never finds out. I don't want her to know that while she was preparing to start your life together, you were playing house with me. *****Reckless***** "You okay in there, Bella?" Maggie yelled from the other room, the glass shattering on the floor having gotten her attention. When I didn't respond, Maggie made her way into the kitchen where I'd been reading. The advertising firm I worked for had placed ads in papers all over the southeast, and my boss had asked me to find copies of them and verify that the ads were as they were supposed to be. I'd left early and hit a few major chains in search of those papers. After finding them all, I went home and poured myself a glass of wine before sitting at the bar to start sifting through them. The number made me was glad we ran a weekday campaign instead of Sunday. I was on my fifth paper, the Nashville Post , when I saw itâ€”the engagement announcement of Katherine Elizabeth Wallace and Edward Anthony Cullen. The wine glass in my hand hit the floor and shattered as I just stared at the picture under his name. "That son of a bitch," Maggie whispered behind me. I didn't say a word. I don't remember if I cried. Hell, I don't even remember the five-hour drive I made that night. I arrived at his parents' house at two o'clock in the morning. There were no cars in the driveway, so I just sat, staring at the window that I had crawled through more than once. When we were in high school, we couldn't get enough of each other, but at that point, I'd had enough of Edward's lies and bullshit to last a lifetime. Just as I was about to make the trek back to Atlanta, the SS pulled into the driveway next to me. "Bella? What are you doing here? We aren't supposed to meet until next weekend, right?" He sounded genuinely concerned. "No, you're right, not until next weekend. I just needed to see you." "Well, come on in. This is a very welcomed surprise." Why did he have to sound so sincere? I needed to yell and scream. I needed answers from him. Instead, I let him love me. When I awoke the next morning, I was wrapped in Edward's arm, and he was still snoring softly. I was determined to get my answers that morning but needed to pee before I started the conversation. I unwrapped myself from his arms, careful not to wake him, and got up and used the bathroom. As I started to walk back down the halI, I realized that it didn't matter what he had to say. It was really over. He'd chosen her, and I hadn't even known she was in the running. Nothing he could say would change the fact that I had allowed him to string me along for far too long. I needed to reclaim me, remember who I was. I tiptoed into his room and looked in at his sleeping form. He was beautiful as he slept and reminded me of the boy I fell in love with so many years ago. But he wasn't that boy anymore, so I whispered good-bye for the last time. And it would be the last time. I needed a new plan, a new start. I'd loved Washington the few times I'd visited my parents since they had moved up there, so I made the decision before I even walked out the front door. I was taking my life back, and I would start anew, far away from Edward Cullen. A/N No, this will not be continued, but I will write a short epi soon. I was going to do a wrap up here but decided that I could better tell the story IN the story!
