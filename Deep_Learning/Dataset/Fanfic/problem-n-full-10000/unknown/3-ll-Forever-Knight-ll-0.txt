dead before then" I said running toward him to deal a blow ' come on then little pup let's see what your made of ' Fenrir said as he ran to intercept me. I ducked a claw aimed at my head and slashed at his shoulder before blocking another claw aimed at my legs, I jumped on his back and stabbed him in the shoulder, he roared trying to shake me of his back I tried holding on to my sword for as long as I could but knew that I didn't have long before I fell off so I grabbed my sword tighter and jumped off his back pulling my sword with me as I landed on the ground I rolled to try and gain some distance from Fenrir, when I looked at Fenrir he had a slight limp from the wound on his shoulder, ' how did you do that nothing can cut me, where did you get that sword pup' it said with anger and a small amount of feat, " come over and I'll tell ya" I said with sarcasm, 'YOU WILL DIE' Fenrir said with rage as he leapt at me, "bring it you flee bag!" I said running at him to take him down for good. We sent many blows to one another before backing off, I had a few miner injury on my arms and on my right leg from a few lucky claw swings I knew that I couldn't keep this up for much longer, Fenrir wasn't fairing any better then me I managed to slice one of his eyes leaving him blind in that eye, I also managed to cut him in his underbelly leaving a deep wound that was bleeding badly coating his white fur red, "Rooar" the beast shouted as it ran at me with fury, I readied my self knowing this is my last chance to kill it ether he dies or I do, just as he jumps to bite my head of I run and slide under him slashing at the wound on his underbelly drawing more blood, when I'm back on my feet I look over to Fenrir and can see him trying to get up but his wounds are to great I walk towards him I raised my sword high in the air ready to finish this once and for all. 'How did this happen I defeated gods how could a mortal damage me so' it asked it self in fear as he watched me get closer to him knowing that he's life was about to end, as I walked towards Fenrir I thought of all the things I've done to get to this moment all the training I put in to make sure this one chance wasn't wasted," I've waited along time for this, say goodbye you bastered" I said bring my sword down on his head taking it clean off with one swing. 'Finally its over' I thought as I dropped to the ground exhausted with the battle over the adrenaline leaving me and darkness was over taking me, but before I fainted I saw three old lady's walking towards me then only darkness. (The Fates POV) The Fates was shocked first they come inspecting a roar they heard then they find Fenrir the god eater fighting some mortal boy who might be the very person we have been looking for the last thousand years that the worlds fate lies in his hands, when they realised who he was they were going try and save him from Fenrir when the unbelievable happened he killed the Fates was to shocked to move the monster who killed gods was defeated by a boy this just conformed what they believed this is the one there mother told them about. "did that really just happen or is old age starting to get to me?" Clotho asked her sisters as they walked towards the boy, "Don't be silly your only just turned 3001 ur practically still a teenager" Atropos told her with amusement in her voice, "lets get back to the problem at hand shall we, what are we going to do about the boy?" Lachesis asked her sisters as she studied the boy they were walking towards, "I don't kno-" Atropos was silences when she and her sisters saw the boy drop to the ground and close his eyes, "shit is he dead" Clotho asked her sisters once they reached the seemingly dead boy, "no his still breathing luckily his wounds are miner" Atropos said to Clotho as she checked his pulse, "thank Chaos, now we need to heal him, if only Apollo was here he could have him up and going in no time" Lachesis commented as she watched the sleeping boy, "Apollo?,that's it!, I got a idea, let's go I'll explain on the way " Atropos said to her sisters as she grabbed the boys hand and flashed away, "she never could stranded still, I wonder if she's the reason demigods have ADHD?" Clotho commented as she and Lachesis followed there sister. ( On Olympus third Person POV) On Olympus in the great throne room of the gods, The Olympians where arguing over what they should do about the monster that's been attacking farms all around Greece when they was momentarily blinded by a bright light when they could see again there before them were four figures three old lady's and a unconscious boy, "Olympians we need to talk" the fates said together as if the words came form one voice, the gods looked at each other worriedly knowing that when the fates wanna talk its bad news.
