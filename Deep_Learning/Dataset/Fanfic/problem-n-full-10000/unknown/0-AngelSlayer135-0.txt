he believed, and thus the train ride passed in silence until a food cart made its way past. Neville grabbed two bottles of water, and offered one to his newly met companion. "Th-thank you." The slightly overweight boy nodded, before returning to silently berating himself for one thing or another. ***HPBB*** "Firs years over here res of you all in the carriages com on now!" the gigantic man called out. Harry and Neville quickly found a boat to share and were whisked across the lake. As the excited giggles and chatter from the other students began to quiet down, and awe of the castle took hold, a young lightning bolt scarred boy reflected on the new… friend he had made. Was friend the correct word? He didn't quite know, never having any himself, but from what he had observed of Dudley this did indeed seem to be true. He had helped return the boy's pet, and the boy had bought him a bottle of water. Upon realizing that he did not have any official robes Neville had offered to loan him a spare until he could purchase his own. By this logic, he would need to return the favor, correct? Isn't that what friends do? So Harry began to ponder what he could give the boy in return. Undoubtedly he would be unable to help him with any schoolwork, perhaps he could help him carry his books? Meanwhile Neville Longbottom had a dilemma of his own, mainly how to keep the tentative relationship with 'Harry' alive. The boy was so thoughtful and quiet, so nonjudgmental of his cowardice and problems… But there was something else . He had volunteered his cloak to the bespectacled boy, without him asking to in the first place. Where had that come from? Not that he minded, in fact he was secretly hoping the boy would keep it just so that he could claim to have been of some use for once. One moment the blonde was wishing for just the barest minimum of courage to speak up, the next he was handing over the object, his voice clear and composed. It was almost as if the person sitting across from him had unknowingly inspired him to do so. As if he had somehow brought out the fearless charisma that the Longbottom heir had always dreamed of possessing. If he could do such a thing with only a few hours of silence… what could he achieve if the boy agreed to be his friend, even if he knew that such a thing was impossible. Why would such an amazing person ever want to be his friend? ***HPBB*** "Come come now first years over here. Thank you again for your assistance Hagrid." The man nodded happily towards the Scottish woman before walking further into the castle. "Now then we will be going in one year at a time starting with seventh. Stay with your house, first years just form a single line." Neville turned to join the others, when he noticed his friend staring at the carriages that had brought the older students in. "Is something wrong Harry?" "The horses…." "What horses?" The black-haired boy turned back to his friend for a moment, and noticed the confused expression on his face. How could he not see them? Skeletal creatures with red eyes and terrible wings drew each of the ornate looking transports. Had he finally gone mad? Imagining things out of the depths of his nightmares? No, he couldn't let on that he had seen them, he didn't want to scare away the only person who had not looked at him like he was a freak. "I…" "Boys what are you two doing? Come along now." The professor ordered as she walked up to herd the two children. "Sorry professor, Harry just thought he saw some horses but I think you put them away already." He answered, before the two boys joined the others. Luckily neither of them noticed the frozen and paling features of Deputy Headmistress. 'Only those who witness a violent death can see a Thestral. Does that mean he is the Harry…' any further thoughts from the woman were interrupted as a gong sounded from deep inside Hogwarts, signaling the time for the new students to enter. ***HPBB*** As the first years were lead into the room Harry gazed about in shock, floating candles, a twinkling ceiling, cups that kept refilling themselves as the person drank… "H-how?" Minerva had been standing close enough to hear the boy, and see his pure amazement at the scene before him. The more she took the boy's appearances in the more she began to recognize his features. "How what Harry?" "How is all of this…" "Magic of course" The boy blinked, before stopping and turning to the elderly woman. "What's magic?" ***A/N*** Welcome ladies and gentlemen to my very first attempt at a Fanfiction not focused around comic books, anime, manga, or cartoons… hopefully it doesn't crash and burn. Whole lotta angst and character weakness, but considering whose insight we are obtaining is it really that strange? Harry is abused for nearly his entire life, such a situation does not lead to healthy mental or social development. Neville is… well pretty much Neville from the actual books. A brief warning now, if anyone is expecting this to follow the books precisely then I apologize. I only read up through Goblet of Fire, and that was years ago, I will be doing a refresher course but… there will be changes. My goals of this story are simple, write a decent fanfic that people enjoy and that I can be proud of, avoid any serious bashing, emphasize several characters while removing a few of the more irritating ones, and make Harry himself as badass as possible without turning him into a Godlike entity. I will be cutting back on the "Author Notes" at the end, because I felt I had too many of them in my last few stories.
