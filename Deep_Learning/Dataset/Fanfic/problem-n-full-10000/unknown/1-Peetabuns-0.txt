fast. With another hand he rubbed her breast, played with her nipple. Katniss spread her legs even further, pressing herself against his strong fingers as he rubbed her all inside. "Peeta... how do you..." She trailed off as she became overwhelmed with pleasure. He had truly hit the spot. "Tell me, is that the spot..." Katniss slowly nodded, letting out a pleasant gasp as he fingered her deeper. "Oh..." She moaned, subconsciously thrusting against him. "I didn't hear you..." He said playfully before fingering her in the same spot once more, while caressing her clitoris. Katniss let out a moan as she fell into his chest, gripping his thighs. He pulled out of her. Looking into his blue eyes. Her breasts at his face. Perfect lip level. Peeta leaned forward and licked her breast, his breath hot against her. Before kissing one while massaging the other. He then left one alone while he dropped it to her lap again. Rubbing her clitoris as he tongued her breast. His fingers curling into her, rubbing so good. Deep again. Katniss leaned into him, gripping the bed frame. Gently thrusting into him, leaning back. So much of this was better than the sex itself. "How do you..do this Peeta." She mumbled as he went into her with his fingers again. "Just lay down..." Katniss did as he asked, easing onto her back between his legs. His lap giving her lower body a slight incline, directed at his face. Her legs bent on both side of him, her goods in his sight. Peeta slipped his finger in her again, the angle helping him. Katniss moaned, arching her back, gripping his legs with her hands. Thrusting against his talented fingers. He went into her with two fingers, double the pleasure now. While another rubbed her clitoris. Katniss watched the ceiling sway as she moved with his fingers. Moaning without even knowing it, his rubbing making her faint. "How does it feel?" He asked, still fingering her. Katniss answered with another moan, Peeta's name trailing off at the end of it. He slowly stopped, Katniss lying still for a moment, before feeling him pressing hard against her behind, making her rise. She straddled him once more, blood rushing to her head, passionately licking the inside of his mouth, his tongue. Her kissing growing stronger as the blond pulled her closer to him. He left her lips and licked all the way down to her chest. Sucking each breast, licking her neck. Then down her body again. Fingering her once more. But as his hand went down into her again, Katniss pulled him away, leaning down and biting his lip. "Your turn." Her hand slid down his chest, into his lap. And began to rub him up and down. Going faster and faster. Peeta's eyes closed. Katniss rubbed gently, then quick again. Her other hand rubbing him below. She rubbed faster as he let out a moan. His head falling against the headboard. "How do you, do this..." he asked through a gasp as she went again and again, before surprising him while his eyes were closed. She sank onto his lap, slipping him into her. He gasped as she thrusted, slowly, pressing him against the bed, leaning back. Her breasts in his face. He caressed them as she thrusted, licking them again. Then massaging her clitoris again as she pressed him as deep into her as she could. So deep. So good. Again and again. Peeta moaned, his head on her shoulder as they thrusted as one. "Katniss..." He half moaned half whispered. He pulled his head back and began to suck her neck. Licking delicately. After a few moments Katniss fell into his chest, his hands on her breasts again. Fingering her nipples as she pulled him out of her. Both panting again. "You're beautiful." He whispered, kissing each breast before pressing his lips against her's. "No, you are." Still straddling him, she rested her head on his shoulder, her breasts pressed against his sweaty chest. Peeta's hands massaged her rump before sliding up her slender back and embracing her. Holding her close. "I want to look at you." She whispered, leaning back. "Okay." Peeta scooted himself till he was lying on his back, Katniss moving herself for a moment. He propped his head on a pillow. Katniss smiled, looking into his sweet blue eyes. She straddled him once more. "Not yet, it's too soon." Katniss smirked. "Just relax, Peeta. I just want to lie with you. Like the old times." She could feel him beneath her, so close to her insides again but she too agreed it was too soon. They both needed a rest. Peeta reached up caressing her breasts, sliding his hands down to her hips as she sat atop him, looking into eachother's eyes. "But those times, we weren't exactly naked." Katniss laughed. "We weren't there yet." She pressed her bare chest against his, sliding her hands down his arms till they reached his hands. They intertwined their fingers, looking into eachother's eyes once more. Katniss pecked his lips before smiling down at his face. Peeta let go of her hands and wrapped his arms around her warm body, holding her against him. She could feel his warm breath on her hot cheeks. She pressed her face against his chest, nestling below his chin, a hand entangled in his blonde curls. "I say we spend all day tomorrow in the river." Peeta said. "Naked." Katniss whispered. "Let's hope Haymitch doesn't come out for a drink." "He's seen worse things." "That is true." Peeta sighed, hugging Katniss. She kissed his chin before closing her eyes. So relaxed in his arms. Her breathing slowed, as did his. But their loving grip on one another did not fade as they slipped into a deep sleep. Their hearts breathing against one another. Their body's and souls as one.
