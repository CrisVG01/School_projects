least it doesn't smell like sex- Embry: Jesus, Jake. Do you have to? Jake: They are whispering and making out like teenagers. Jake flashed Embry a memory of it. Embry: Fuck's sake, Jake. Don't show me that . Jake: Well if I have to see it, you can, too. Ugh. That's it! I'm sleeping at your place. Jake phased out and headed for Embry's house. Tiffany opened her eyes. It took her a second to remember where she was. She was squeezed into Billy Black's single bed, with him. The bicep under her face was firm and well developed. She rubbed her cheek on it. His elbow was folded up and his arm was holding her close. "Morning," he whispered. "It's a good morning, isn't it?" "Definitely." She chuckled. He reached for her hand, their fingers interlaced. He gave it a gentle squeeze. "Do you have plans for today?" "Are you asking me on a date?" "Sure am." She smiled. "I'd like that." She thought for a minute. "What will we do?" "Whatever you want." "Not fishing." It was a statement. "Awww," he mock complained, "What's wrong with fishing?" "Nothing. But surely you do enough of that?" "A man's gotta eat and feed his boy." "I hear you. My gosh, they eat so much." She stopped suddenly as she realised they were back on shaky ground. She felt Billy's lips press at the back of her neck. "He'll be fine." "I know. You told me. But you didn't… you know… tell me." "No." Silence. The silence stretched. Tiffany thought about her son. "Oh, no! I didn't go home last night." "No. You naughty girl." "But Embry-" "Embry will be fine. He's sixteen, like Jake. He looks after me half the time." She squirmed. "I know… but-" "But nothing. Now we have some things to do and then I will meet you at the kitchen table." "For breakfast?" "Something like that." "Oh. Okay." She had no idea what he meant. They did their morning ablutions and then had coffee. They kept touching each other; kissing and maintaining physical contact. Billy patted his hand on the table top. "Up you go, Tiffany." "What?" He huffed out a breath. "I can't be spontaneous or romantic and sweep you off your feet. I can't even get it up for you. But I can still look after you." She blinked. "P-pardon?" He lifted his eyebrows. "I've got hands and a mouth," he suggested. She looked completely blank. "You want me to… on the table?" "Easiest for me. And you said you liked my shoulders." "What about Viagra," she asked suddenly. Billy shook his head. "Nitrates. The combination would be bad." "What if someone sees us?" "It's early. No one will come over." He frowned at her. "I never thought I would need to talk you into it." "Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. I'm being kind of rude. It's just… I-" "Do you want to do this, Tiffany?" "Yes. Sorry." She smiled at him. "What do I do?" "Come here." His voice was low and sensual. She sidled closer to him. His hands reached up under her dress and slid her panties down. They dropped to the floor and she stepped out of them. "Are you sure?" she asked suddenly. "I cannot tell you how much I miss the taste of a woman," Billy said. "Ooh." He patted the table top again. She clambered up awkwardly. She sat on the table with her legs hanging down. Billy manoeuvred his wheelchair closer to the table and slid his hands underneath her thighs. "Scoot forward a bit," he requested. "Towards me so that you sit right on the edge of the table." She did. He lifted her foot and put it on the arm of his chair. She put her hand on his head. She still looked concerned. "Seriously, I want to do this," he said. He rubbed his hands along her legs and up her thighs. He kept his eyes on her face and his warm palms on her skin. He just kept touching her until she had relaxed a little. Then he lowered his face and kissed her, extremely gently on the inside of the thigh. She shivered. Her fingers clenched in his hair. He kissed her again a little further up. He kept placing delicate kisses on her thighs until she was almost wishing he would kiss her somewhere else. "Mmm, you smell good," he sighed. She closed her eyes. She leaned back on her elbows and gave herself to him. She forgot about his disability. She let him love her. He paused, and then placed another kiss at the top of her pubic mound. Then he kissed his way lower. She wanted to squirm. She had to try hard to hold herself immobile. She was already so excited. She groaned aloud when he reached her clitoris. He placed a tantalizing kiss right on top of it. He grabbed her around the thighs and shunted her back towards him. He buried his face in her. His tongue licked at her and his lips nibbled at her labia. "Oh, Billy," she groaned. He moved slightly and lifted her leg onto one of his wide shoulders. The other he pushed so that it lay flatter on the table; opening her right out for him. He returned his mouth to her and then slid a finger inside her. She pressed herself onto him. She could feel how wet she was. He slid a second finger inside her at the same time that he nibbled at her clit gently and she cried out. The boys approached the house. Embry heard his mother cry out and ran forward before Jake could grab him. They both got an eyeful of Tiffany spread out on the table. They turned and ran back to the forest. Just inside the tree line, Embry grabbed hold of Jake's arm. "We will never speak of this," he said vehemently. "Yeah. No way, man. Never ," agreed Jake.
