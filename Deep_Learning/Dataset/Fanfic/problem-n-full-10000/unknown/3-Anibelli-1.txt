of the most amazing, incredible, feelsy shows I've ever watched. Hmm." She said, tilting her head at me. "You seem like a Jay girl. But he's taken. Maybe…" She said, pondering options. "Heya." A voice said from the door. I shrieked, and Annabeth jumped silently. Leo's face poked in the doorway, a small grin on his lips. "Annabeth rambling about Ninjago? I don't envy you, Piper Mclean. I love the show too, but this girl rambles a lot." He sang, pointing to the blonde headed female. She threw a pen at him, and he yelled, ducking out of the room. The pen stabbed the wall, quivering slightly. My eyes widened at her aim. She would have hit his eye. "Nice throw." I said, blinking. She shook her head. "Boys." She mumbled, grabbing her notebook and following the Latino out the door. I trailed behind her, into the seating area, to see the band lounging on the couches. My mouth twisted into a frown. "You have your own bus, why are you here?" I couldn't help but ask. "Because you guys are here. It's boring with just those three." Percy said. Jason swiped on his phone, and Frank scribbled on some paper. "Because we're here?" I repeated. "They're like leeches. Clingy, lonely unless with a host, and never letting go." Annabeth explained. All four boys immediately stood. "Let it goooo!" They all sang in unison. Annabeth groaned louder than the band. Despite my hatred of the stuck up boys, I couldn't help but laugh at how easily they could affect Annabeth. "I hate all four of you." She said, dropping her head in her hands. "Except Percy. You hold him in a special place in your heart." Jason muttered. Leo laughed. "Ba Dum Tssss." He mimicked drumming. Annabeth glared at Jason, a small pink arising to her cheeks. Percy winked and she groaned, storming off the bus. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to follow her, so I stood there awkwardly. Frank watched me. "So, your dad is Tristan Mclean? What's that like?" He asked after a moment. I shrugged. "I don't know. I haven't actually spent all that much time with him. This is all new to me. He's always so busy." I said, avoiding eye contact with any of them. "You really hate us, don't you." Percy said. It wasn't a question. I shrugged again, picking a magazine up off the coffee table. "Why?" "You don't want that answer." I snapped. "No, I really do. I want to change my attitude so cool people like you don't hate me." Percy reasoned. "The only reason I'm 'cool' is because my dad's famous." I muttered bitterly. "Nah. I heard from your dad that you surf and skateboard. I really want to try surfing, and I love skateboarding." "I'm sure you do." I mumbled. "Why's that?" He asked. "You ask a lot of questions." I said. "You change the topic a lot." He pointed out. "Fine. You seem like a typical bad-boy jack-hole. The elf over here seems ridiculously self-centered, blondie looks like he's silently judging everyone, even his fans, and Frank… I don't know much about you, to be honest." I said. "Well, you're right on some accounts." Jason smirked. "Which ones?" "Well, for starters, Leo loves to over glorify himself. But deep down, he hates how he appears. You should have heard him on Confessions Day. He want's to be-." He stopped at Leo's face. "Moving on. Percy does come off as a bad boy. But he's really a Mama's boy. You should have seen his face when he was told Sally couldn't come on the tour." He said as Percy pouted. "Shut up! I miss her!" He whined, slumping into the couch and hugging a pillow like a child. "I do silently judge people. Just people I know. It's more like I'm thinking about how I think they will act. Most of the time, it's in a positive way. Unless he's a jerk. Then I think he's a jerk." He said. I stifled a chuckle. "Okay. Fine. But you all appear so stuck up." I said, wrinkling my nose. "How do you know how we appear?" Frank asked, raising an eyebrow. "I… I watched an interview of you guys. You all seemed so snotty and jerkish." I confessed. "Which one was it?" Jason asked. "The one with Aphrodite." I said, averting my eyes. If they found out my mother was famous too... "Hmm, you don't seem like the type of girl to watch Aph's video's." Percy said, eyeing my clothes. "It was the first one I found. My dad gave me homework." I snapped. "Fine. I'll be honest. We all had lines to say. They wanted us to appear tough, for some reason." "But we already do that." Leo chimed in. "Sure. I hated it, I wanted to answer honestly, but Fredrick made us. It sorta sucked." Jason said, shrugging. I twisted my mouth, and Jason's eyes leapt to my lips. I stopped, and clenched my jaw. "So, back to normal conversations, what do you like to do?" "Hang out with my friends." I said. "Well, they aren't here, so we'll have to sub in!" Leo cheered. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. "Great." I said, opening them. Jason was stifling laughter, Frank smiling a bit. "Hey, they aren't so bad. Sure, they get real annoying real fast, but they are good for making fun of." Annabeth said, boarding the bus. She eyed the boys. "Off." She said, pointing out the door. They immediately started complaining. "What?" "Annie, no!" "But why?" "Not my orders. Dad's. Get on your bus. And don't call me Annie." She demanded. Percy snorted. She glared at them harder. They all groaned but slowly got off, dragging their feet and pouting. I watched them go. "They're children." I said in amazement. "Large, stupid, silly children." I collapsed on the couch. She sat next to me and grinned. "Welcome to the team."
