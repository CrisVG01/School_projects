WILL! I mean, saving Middle-earth isn't that much of a biggie. But I'll do ANYTHING to save us from THAT. By the way, I have a present for you! *holds out a small, suspiciously-shaped-like-a-ring package* Galadriel: Why thank you, Frodo! *opens it and instantly turns into a giantess with thunder and lightning coming out of nowhere * IT'S MINE! IT'S MINE! HAHA! I – wait… Frodo: You're green. Galadriel: *sighs and hands the ring back to Frodo* Here, I don't want it. I just got an A plus on my lighting and sound effects test. Frodo: You're telling me. Galadriel: Yeah, now I can go home. Frodo: Um… *scratches head* Galadriel: It's complicated. Take the ring. Go to Mount Doom, destroy it, and live happily ever after, etcetera etcetera. Oh, and by the way, Boromir's going to try and take your ring. Frodo: Uh, rrrrriiight. Okay. Good to know. *the next morning* Galadriel: *walks to Aragorn* We probably won't see each other again, Aragorn, but if I was a little younger… Celeborn: *clears throat* Galadriel: …and human, I'd love to have you for a son. Celeborn: *solemnly* Make us proud, boy. Aragorn: Thanks, guys. That means a lot to me. Galadriel: *moves on to Legolas* Here's a bow and quiver and arrows, Legolas. Trust in them and they won't easily miss. And skill doesn't hurt, either. Legolas: *bows deeply and rises* Thank you, O Queen of the Golden Wood Lothlorien, I shall never forget the great honor you have bestowed upon me. May dandruff never plague your golden head. Galadriel: You're welcome. *moves on to the hobbits and gives Sam, Pippin, and Merry each a knife* Merry: WHAT IS IT WITH YOU PEOPLE! YOU KEEP GIVING PIP SHARP THINGS! Pippin: *indignantly* Hey! Sam: Hey! I got a dagger! Nice and shiny and - Galadriel: WHOOPS! *snatches knife from Sam* Here you go. *plops a bunch of dirt into Sam's hand* Sam: Dirt? Galadriel: Special dirt! Sam: Oh. Thank you. *sniffs and mutters* I DID like the dagger. Galadriel: *looks at Gimli* Here. *hands him three strands of her hair* There you go. Gimli: Hair? HAIR! Well, that is just lovely. And here are some of my toenail clippings. May you cherish them forever. Galadriel: *blinks, taken aback, as Celeborn tries to stifle a giggle and the hobbits burst into gales of hysterical laughter* *finally, Galadriel moves on to Frodo* Here. Frodo: Chanel No. 5? Galadriel: NO! That's the light of Velveeta, our most beloved star! Frodo: Explain just how you managed to bottle light. Gimli: Hah! It's snake oil, Frodo. She's a cheapskate. After all, she gave me hair. * as Galadriel waves farewell, looking somewhat put out at the way her 'gifts' were received* Pippin: Hey, she forgot you, Boromir! Boromir: HEY! She DID! Well, at least we all got elven cloaks. Merry: Yeah. Goodie. It's like giving someone a coat for Christmas. Legolas: Let's all sing a boating song! Aragorn: GOOD IDEA! Row, row, row the boat(s), gently down the stream… Boromir: *under breath* Once the Ring of Doom is mine, I'll only need a queen! A few hours later… Aragorn: Coming up on your left and right you'll see two statues! Pippin: …ooh! Aragorn: Yes, very ooh! *two minutes later they pass two lawn gnomes placed strategically on either side of the river* Aragorn: *sighs happily* Long have I desired to look upon the faces of my ancestors. Boromir: Well, *draws sword* if you really want to, I'd be happy to oblige! Aragorn: *paddles faster* *two hours later* Pippin: Uh… guys? Everyone Else: *oblivious* Pippin: Water! Moving fast! GUYS! Everyone Else: *oblivious* Pippin: AAAAAHHH! WATERFALL! *They climb out of the boats and get on land due to Pippin's screams* Sam: Whew! That woulda ended the Fellowship right there, wouldn't it, Mr. Frodo? Frodo: *glares* Legolas: *looks around, then moves over to Aragorn: I've got a bad feeling about this. Aragorn: About what? Legolas: This place. It gives me the creeps. Aragorn: Too bad, so sad. We'll be leaving soon, anyway. Pippin: *suddenly* Hey, where's Frodo? Merry: And where's Boromir? *Everyone looks at everyone else and says "Uh-oh."* Boromir: *sees Frodo* Hey! You shouldn't be wandering around all by your lonesome in such a hostile, forbidden-looking place! Frodo: Pardon? Boromir: Don't go off by yourself. Frodo: Oh. Sorry. Boromir: Can I have the ring? Frodo: No. Boromir: PLEEEASE? Frodo: No! Boromir: Pretty please with a mushroom on top? Frodo: *wavers* well… NO! Boromir: AAWWW, MAAAN! *throws giant temper tantrum* Frodo: *runs off so as to avoid flying wood chips* Boromir: *two seconds later* Whew, glad to get that off my chest. Hey, Frodo! Where'd you go! *Uruk-Hai suddenly surround everyone everywhere* Boromir: Merry! Pippin! I'll save you! Lurtz: *shoots him* Boromir: Okay, maybe I won't. Lurtz: Hey, this is fun! *shoots Boromir again* Boromir: Y'know, one would have been enough. Lurtz: Me like this bow! *shoots Boromir yet again* Boromir: Okay! You want me to die! FINE! I'll DIE! *falls over* Lurtz: Hahaha! Me like new toy! *is just in time to have his arm cut off, be run through the middle, and get decapitated by Aragorn, who is just a little ticked off at the moment* *Aragorn and Boromir say their last words and Boromir dies* * Legolas and Gimli walk into clearing* Legolas: Oh, look! He's dead. That's a shame. Aragorn: *looks up* For Pete's sake, Legolas. You could at least have the decency not to look like you're trying to throw up. Gimli: *chortles* Legolas: *sniffs* Gimli: Hey! Where's Frodo? And Sam! And Merry? And Pippin! Aragorn: *groans* Great. The Uruks took Merry and Pippin, and Frodo and Sam ran off to Mount Doom to destroy the ring. Legolas: I vote we go after Merry and Pippin. Gimli: Me, too. Aragorn: Good decision. Let's go Hobbit Hunting! Legolas: *blinks* I thought we wanted to save Merry and Pippin. Aragorn: I mean Orc Hunting. Gimli: They're Uruks. Not Orcs. Aragorn: Whatever. To infinity – and beyond!
