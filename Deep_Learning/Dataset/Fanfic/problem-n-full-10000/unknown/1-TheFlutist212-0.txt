elevator shedders and the match falls. The elevator shoots up, and we free-fall until the cold ground, still wet from the previous rain, hits us. We're both winded, but Hazelle manages to get me up and drag me toward him. I don't resist. I'm too tired. Too dead to the world. And we reach the house. The house where the boy is cuddled up with him, on his lap. And I cry. And cry. "Gale, explain," Hazelle says firmly. "Well, in Two, I had a friend, a single mother, and she needed help, so I helped raise the kid," he said shortly. And I was jealous of this woman. I was locked up, and he was with her, and I was lonely, and cold. And she was there, in his arms. I built up an extreme hate for this woman, and a barrier against the world. Now I was truly alone. Hazelle was like a mother to me, but I would never be able to trust her like I did my true mother. Or my sister. I told myself these were memories, nonexistent anymore, but it didn't help, and I was on the floor. A used, wasted body. An old shirt thrown on the floor. Useless. I wish the mine hadn't exploded. I wanted to go back there now, with a match. And it squeezed, and hurt. She kicked. And I fainted. And I dreamed. The most awful dream. He was with her, and I was standing there, and could only watch. Eyes glued on them, stuck open. I couldn't move, couldn't make a sound, couldn't close my eyes. When I woke up my eyes burned, like in the dream, but not from being open. From tears, I realized. I was on the bed, and he was looking at me. He was concerned. I kicked him. He fell of the bed. And I laughed. So he got up and left, just left. CHAPTER 8 LAUGHING WAS THE LAST THING I DID. After that, when I tried to get up, speak, even sleep, I thought about him. Holding her. And I couldn't do anything. But cry. And cry. The only words that ever came out of my mouth were "GET OUT" that occurred on the rare occasion when he came into my room. I was starving myself, my state deteriorating by the second. And then there was a time when I did need someone. "HAZELLE!" I called anxiously. "Hazelle?" She wasn't home. "GALE! GALE!" I was going crazy. He had been coming back from hunting and heard me. I heard his sack drop outside and he burst into my room. "Oh my God!" he cried. He picked me up and ran. I was in tears. He tried comforting me, but it didn't work. And I was back in the place I had run from for so long. The place I never wanted to be again. I was under 12. He was holding my hand the entire time. "Breathe," he said softly, "breath." But I couldn't. It hurt. It hurt so much. Nothing was helping. And she was born. But she wasn't a she. Or a he. A nothing. And it was my fault. She was dead. "She was badly malnourished," the doctor said frankly. I don't think my days at the hospital earned any sympathy from him. "Fix it," I said. "I-I ca-" "FIX IT!" I was in tears. My strength, what kept me going, was gone? It couldn't have happened. But it did. And it was my fault. My fault. "Prim, are you okay?" Gale asked. "My fault," I moaned, "my fault." "This wasn't your fault," he said, "it wasn't." "YES IT WAS!" I screamed back. He knew it was. I knew it was. Why does he keep feeding me lies? He started to tell me it wasn't my fault again. "SHUT UP! WE BOTH KNOW IT WAS!" I said, starting to cry again. "It was," I whispered. This time, he didn't offer any verbal support. He just held me, we both sat there weeping, with me cradled in his arms. And one day, I got up. I took the box of matches from my coat pocket, and ran outside. I found another mine. I went down. He was still at the top, waiting on the elevator to come back up. "No! Prim!" he screamed. "I love you" I called back, and with those three words, I lit the match and let it fall. EPILOUGE I STILL WATCH HIM. He and his happy family. I was jealous, but mostly happy. When I watched the joy on his face when the first came, I was happy. Same with the second, third, and the twins. I was happy. For him. For her. For the family. They had a good life together, the life I wanted our family to have. And he got it. It's good enough, isn't it? My other half gets to live what I wanted. It isn't what he wanted. When I walk through the Seam at night, I hear the tears. To her, they are silent, but to me, each tear soaking into the blanket is a call for me. Her's did it too. Killed himself. And as he and I stand over the bed, we share one thing. Loathing. For our love's new half. Peeta would take the melancholy walk through the Seam with me. Gale didn't want her. He wanted me. She wanted the dead, and so did he. Gale wanted Prim, not Katniss. And I was watching that night, when he took the knife. Into the room. His final resting place. The knife plunged into his heart. And he was there, his spirit, holding my hand. And there were many tearful kisses. Then she woke up. She pulled the knife out of his body. With no one left for her, the kids married in different districts, she did the same. She came to me first, and I expirienced sisterly love for the first time in years.
