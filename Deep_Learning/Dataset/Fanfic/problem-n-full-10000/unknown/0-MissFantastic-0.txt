in that way. "Did she really put a spell on us, like she sang?" Ginny just laughed and shook her head. "Siren, ladies and gentlemen!" Zabini waltzed back on stage, still smiling brightly. The crowd continued to cheer. "I can tell you that Siren will be performing a second time this evening to close out the show. The night is still young my friends. On with the show!" The well-muscled, shirtless wizard came out next and juggled a variety of objects, including blue bell flames that he'd conjured. Sirius felt that was impressive. He was followed by a statuesque witch in a silver sequined sleeveless jumpsuit. The witch was tall, a bit over two meters Sirius guessed. She was joined on stage by a lovely assistant, who was of course barely clothed. The assistant stood against a moveable wall that was put up for this performance and the witch threw knives toward her. Each knife landed within a finger-width of the witch. It was all very dramatic. She brought out a bow and arrow, and then proceeded to shoot items off the assistant's head, out of her hands, and even between her knees. Sirius loved it! So many witches and wizards relied on magic and had awful hand-eye coordination without it. Sirius' drink was replenished efficiently during the performances and he noted that service to everyone was both unobtrusive and impeccable. He even liked Zabini's prattle in between each of the acts. He joked, teased the crowd, and flattered them all. Sirius was having a good time and was a bit eager to see Siren again, if he were being honest. Her performance was so dramatic and he wanted to find out if she would be just as enthralling a second time, or if it had been the novelty of the mystery singer that was most interesting. ** Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard ** When the curtain parted again, the three poles were back on the stage, one in center stage and the other two forward on the stage, but to each side. A song began and the singer issued an invitation to " pour some sugar on me ," as three witches stepped out onto stage. They were all dressed in satin silver shorts as well as tight green tops. Sirius immensely enjoyed watching them dance around the poles and remove those items of clothing, leaving them just in silver g-strings. When the three witches began to move up the poles and spin around, Sirius appreciated their athleticism. He doubted he could've done what they did if he practiced for a month! After that rousing performance, it seemed it was finally time to see her again. Zabini came out and chatted a bit in front of the curtain, thanking everyone for coming. When the curtain parted again, the stage was entirely dark. This time the spotlight found her in the very center of the stage. Siren wore the same black half-mask, but her long hair was pulled back in a ponytail high on her head. She was wearing a black leather corset with tiny black knickers. Black stiletto leather boots went up to her mid-thigh. She was standing with her feet shoulder length apart and was twirling a riding crop in her hands. The crowd erupted and Sirius felt she looked like the perfect dominatrix. "Thank you, darlings," she purred. "I've put together something special in honor of the luscious Lucius for his birthday." ** S&M by Rihanna ** Music filled the room, a voice singing Na na na na, Come on as the lights on the stage expanded. Surrounding Siren were four witches, all bound in various positions by thick black rope that hung from the ceiling. The four witches wore black leather bras and knickers. Siren sauntered around the stage as the music continued, running the riding crop over the witches. "Feels so good being bad," she began to sing. "There's no way I'm turning back." Sirius was again enthralled by her as she sang about pain and pleasure, caressing the witches on stage. The other witches were delightful to look at, but they were her props and Sirius found her capturing his attention. He moved a bit forward in his seat when she moved to leave the stage again, as she had in her last song. "Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it," she sang as she approached Lucius. Siren reached out and ran the riding crop down the side of Malfoy's face to his chin, then pushed it up making him tilt his head. She walked behind him as she sang about sex, chains, and whips. Sirius regretted that his own birthday and had passed months ago. Siren held the whip with both hands behind Malfoy, the center of the crop pressed into his neck and pushing his head back into her lush cleavage. Sirius smirked when the aristocrat's eyes closed in pleasure. He couldn't hear Malfoy groan over the music, but Sirius was sure it happened. Sirius swore he heard a collective sigh from the crowd when Siren returned to the stage, rather than treating others in the crowd to her attentions. She continued the song on stage, interacting with the trussed witches and dancing so very provocatively. Even though she didn't take off any clothing, Sirius found her performance more stimulating than the witches that had disrobed. He liked them too, of course. Siren, though, she was amazing. Her voice melted like butter around him and she exuded sex. Sirius couldn't remember the last time he's been more turned on. All too soon, the song was over and the curtain closed. Sirius knew he would be dedicating some time to finding out the identity of this mystery witch. He had to meet her, to find this captivating witch. He looked over to Ginny and favored her with this best, most charming smile. He could make his young friend give him information, he was sure. Next: Hermione!
