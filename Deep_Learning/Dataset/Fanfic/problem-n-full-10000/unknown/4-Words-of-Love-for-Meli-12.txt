had to…" "Oh, really?" he hummed around the swollen clit that was throbbing in his mouth. "You just had to let them put their hands on you and press against your body and breathe in your ear? Are you saying that you didn't enjoy it?" "No! I didn't…oh God…yes! Just like that…please…don't stop…" Bella could barely stand the building ache and pushed herself down further onto the teasing tongue. All movement suddenly ceased, and she cried out in desperation. He chuckled. "Well, beautiful Bella, maybe I have to stop right now. Maybe I enjoy seeing you lying naked in front of me, panting and writhing and wanting more. Maybe now you'll understand how I felt tonight." "I'm sorry! Please…" She was almost in tears. His arms were around her in a flash. "Oh baby, I'm sorry. I was just playing with you. I'd never leave you wanting—you have to know that." "Then take me now," she pleaded. "I need you inside me. I need your hard, thick cock pounding into me…" "Yes," he hissed, ripping off his own clothes as fast as he could. His eyes widened in hunger when her hands slipped between her legs, spreading herself open and furiously rubbing her clit. They both cried out when he shoved his dick hard inside her. Bella wasted no time flinging her arms and legs around him, holding on as tightly as she could to keep from being heaved off the bed from the force of his punishing thrusts. "Harder," she begged as she clawed up and down his back, trying to find an outlet for the excess of pressure building inside her. When her teeth latched onto his shoulder, he growled and clenched his hand around her breast. The heady smell of their lust, the sound of skin slapping against skin, the taste of salty sweat—it combined and swirled and overwhelmed their senses until the unbearable ache burst into a crashing cascade of relief. Bella gasped as her entire body tightened in wave after wave of pure pleasure that left her tingling and breathless. She felt him jerk and pulse inside her, filling her up with all that he had. "Oh my god," she sighed when he collapsed in an exhausted heap on top of her. "That was so good." "Mm, yes it was." His words were muffled against the mattress. "Let's do it again." "Right now? Really?" "Well, maybe I'll give you a few minutes to recover." She laughed and shoved on his chest until he rolled off her. " I need a few minutes?" She grabbed a handful of tissues from her nightstand and began cleaning his now-soft penis. "I'm good for multiple orgasms. Mr. Floppy here, on the other hand, seems to be out for the count." "Gee, kick a guy when he's down, why don't you?" he groused playfully as he turned on his side to look at her. He stared into her deep brown eyes and then gave a tender smile. "Hey, guess what?" "What?" "I love you, Bella Swan." Even in the dimness, he could tell she was blushing. But there was no hesitation in her answer. "I love you, too, Edward Cullen." She lifted her head to meet him in a sweet, adoring kiss that expressed their feelings for each other much better than words could. Sighing happily, she coaxed him onto his back and situated herself in the crook of his arm. "So tonight went pretty well," she noted. "Alice and Emmett were so confused! That was fun to watch." "Hmph. Hell of a lot better than having to see you get your flirt on," Edward grumbled. "Oh, stop," Bella chided, tapping him on the chest. "It was all part of the plan. You know it didn't mean anything." Edward grabbed her hips and pulled her on top of him. "Oh, I know that, do I?" he teased. "Maybe I need some convincing. You're sure you don't want any of those other losers? Just me?" "Yes, you silly man. Take me out on a real first date, and you'll see that I only have eyes for you." "I'll just have to do that, then." He pecked her lips and then tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "It'll be nice to finally 'come out' tomorrow. I had a hard time keeping my hands off you earlier." Bella grinned widely. "I can't wait until Rose brings Alice and Emmett over in the morning to find us in bed together. Their heads are going to explode!" "That Rose is one devious woman. Going behind their backs to clue us in on their bet and planning out tonight's scenario…" Edward shook his head. "I hope she never turns her evil genius on me." "Oh, this little scheme was nothing. She was holding back since you've only known her for two weeks. At least the police weren't involved this time." "Great, I can't wait," he said sardonically. "Yeah, but we do owe her for bringing us together the way she did," Bella pointed out. "I wonder how things would've turned out if we'd met for the first time tonight like we were supposed to." Edward nuzzled his nose into Bella's hair and laved kisses on her neck. "Oh, I'm sure we would've ended up together one way or another. After all, I'm irresistible." "And apparently, also very cocky," Bella managed to get out in between quiet whimpers of pleasure. Edward chuckled and bucked his hips up into her lower body. "Why yes, yes I am." Bella sucked in a breath as the tip of his proof positive slipped into her entrance. "I see that Mr. Floppy's recovery time is over." "Mm hmm. And Mr. Hard and Thick is quite excited to get back in the game," Edward murmured, flipping them over so that Bella was underneath him. "I bet he can make you come two times this round." She moaned as he thrust deeply inside her. "That's a bet I'd love to lose."
