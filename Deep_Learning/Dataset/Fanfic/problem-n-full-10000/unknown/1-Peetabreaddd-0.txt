that loving him his hard, because your afraid of the future. Your afraid to get married and have children, and watch them be reaped. But listen to me. Your children will never go into the Arena. The 75th Hunger Games is the last Hunger Games. I promise this Katniss. When you get scared, remember my words. Love Peeta. Don't be afraid to fall in love because you will have a happy ending. Don't be scared of this second chance. Have faith. Have patience. And be strong my beautiful Katniss." her father said. It was starting to get very bright. Katniss shook her head and grabbed onto her father. "No please daddy. Don't leave me. I love you please don't go. I need you." Katniss cried, holding on tightly. "Everything happens for a reason. You were meant to be the Savior. Because you have goodness in you. I love you." he said. Katniss cried. She couldn't let him go. But she knew she had to. When she opened her eyes, she gasped and sat up. No. She couldn't be back here. She tried to kill herself, and her father sent her back to District 12. Not only to District 12, but to the Seam. Back to her old house that they shared with their father. She could see two lumps in her mothers bed. Katniss shook her head. No this wasn't read. She grabbed her clothes and boots and ran outside. The Seam? It wasn't burnt down? "Oh God." Katniss spun around and threw up. This wasn't happening. She wasn't back in the Seam. She had to figure out what to do. She stood up and threw her hands in the air, and let out a pathetic laugh, with tears. "I'm going crazy. I've lost my mind. This is one of my nightmares." Katniss cried. She had to find Peeta and Haymitch. The Victor's Villiage was close to her. She ran to the Victor's Villiage and stopped in front of her house. She must have sleep walked into the Seam. That must have been what happened. But her old house was bombed. Nothing was left. She shook her head again. She must have just been sleep walking. She hadn't realized she was still crying. But she felt the heat in the house. Her house was always so hot. And she felt the pain in her wrists. She knew she cute her wrists. And she felts her fathers arms around her. She was really with her father. "Katniss!" she heard her name being called. She turned around, and saw Peeta running towards her. He was frantic. "Peeta!" Katniss cried. Peeta crashed into her. Hugging her, crying, and pulling her away and looking at her. "I woke up in my bed at the Bakery. You were dead in my arms. I just got off the train and found. You killed yourself and died in my arms. I don't get this. What happened?" Peeta cried. "I don't know. I was just sitting in my house. I missed you so much. And Prim and Finnick. It's my fault Snow captured and hijacked you. Everything's my fault and I just wanted it to end and see Prim again but I didn't see her." Katniss screamed. Peeta held her face trying to calm her. "Katniss calm down please. I don't understand. Snow bombed my familys bakery. How could I wake up there?" Peeta asked. "I don't know I woke up in the Seam." Katniss cried. All of a sudden, Haymitch's door slammed open and he came stumbling out. He charged over to them and grabbed Katniss' hands and examined them. "You were on the ground. You were bleeding, what the hell happened?" Haymitch demanded. "I don't know." Katniss cried. Haymitch yanked on both of them. "Get in here." Haymitch said, and pulled them into his house. He waited till Peeta shut the door, to start talking again. "You were bleeding on the ground. I was cleaning up the blood on the ground, and trying to stand this boy up, when I open my eyes, and here I am. In my own house. And his painting isn't here." Haymitch said, pointing to an empty wall. "Peeta painted a picture, and hung it up when I brought you to home after the Games. Where is it? Where the hell is it? And how the hell are you standing there alive?" Haymitch demanded. "My leg." Peeta whispered. Haymitch and Katniss looked over at him. He bent down, and pulled up his pant leg. Katniss gasped. His leg. His real leg was there. Katniss ran to him and fell to her knees, grabbing Peeta's leg. She cried as she scratched and pulled at his leg. "It's real. Oh my God. He told me I would get a second chance. He gave you your leg back." Katniss cried. Peeta grabbed her and pulled her to her feet. Peeta put his hands on her face to focus her, and tried to get her to calm down. "Katniss. I need you to tell me what is going on." Peeta asked. "I have a second chance. We have a second chance. To make things right. He gave me a second chance." Katniss cried. "Who did? Katniss who gave you a second chance? None of this is making any sense." Peeta said. "My dad. I saw him. He was in the woods. I said I wanted to be with Prim. He said he was giving me a second chance, and that everything would be ok. Your leg Peeta. The bakery and the Seam. There all back." Katniss cried. Haymitch was making noise behind them. He was looking for the remote to turn on the T.V. "Haymitch this isn't the time for watching television." Peeta said. "I'm not watching it for fun. I'm looking for the date." Haymitch said. He flipped a channel and stared at it. He looked slowly back at them. "What day is it?" Peeta asked. "It's reaping day. For the 7th Hunger Games.
