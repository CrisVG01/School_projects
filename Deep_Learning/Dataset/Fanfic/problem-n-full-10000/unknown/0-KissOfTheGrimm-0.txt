nor the fact that several people sat ensconced in the sitting room not sixty feet away. Right now Hermione only cared about one thing, keeping Severus's hands on her body. Severus licked and bit every part of her that he could reach. Hands grasped at her soft skin, kneading it until it was flushed. As her body arched and low, mewling cries left her lips he smiled viciously. She would never forget him, never forget this. He would make damn sure of it. His soul was already black and broken, what was one more blemish? He was going to enjoy this. ************HP*********** Hermione's body flushed at the memory and her body shook. How could she of forgotten something so carnal? She hadn't drank that much, had she? What had she been thinking? Shaking her head, Hermione stumbled into the sitting room where Harry and Ron were playing chess. Without a word, she fell onto the couch, catching both boys attention. "Hermione, you alright?" She nodded, swinging her gaze toward Harry. She felt Ron's weight settle next to her on the scraggly couch. His hand came up to her forehead, his knuckles grazing the skin. "You look flushed 'Mione. What's the matter?" Harry's weight settled on the other side of her, one of his hands gripping hers. "Your chewing your lip Hermione. Something is up." Hermione sighed, trying to figure out where to start. She needed their help. Abortion was out of the question. Looking between them, she opened her mouth then closed it. She once again opened her mouth, this time forcing herself to speak. "I need your help." Harry and Ron stayed silent, waiting for her to find the courage to continue. "You see, I did something. Don't really know if it's good, but it could never be bad. Never." Above her head, Harry gave Ron a perplexed look. What was she talking about? "Hermione, we trust you, trust your judgment. Just tell us what happened and we'll do our best to help you fix it." Hermione shook her head almost violently. "There is no fixing it. I won't take the easy way out. I'm going to do what's right. Fixing it is not an option." Harry was extremely confused. Hermione was speaking in riddles. Well, maybe she was making sense to herself but she was the only one who knew what she was talking about. A quick look at Ron told him the other man was just as perplexed. Ron now had an arm around Hermione's shoulders, her body shaking in his embrace. "Hermione, I promise we'll take care of things, your way, but to do that you have to tell us what's wrong. What did you do?" Closing her eyes, Hermione let out a breath she didn't even realize she was holding. "I'm pregnant." ************HP*********** Two hours later, Harry, Ron and Hermione were still sitting on that couch only this time, they were huddled together under a thick blanket. "You know, I was a miracle baby. Least that's what my mum said. She was almost just shy of forty when I came along. She and my father were so ecstatic." Hermione's voice was low, her head laying on Ron's shoulder. Harry had stretched his legs out sideways, and settled Hermione snuggly between himself and Ron. Ron's legs were stretched in his direction, laying over top of Harry's. "My mother had way too many 'miracle' children." Harry laughed at Ron's sarcasm. Hermione cracked a smile and muttered, "And she loves every one of you." Ron nodded, an easy smile on his face. Harry was still laughing, and managed to stutter out "Malfoy is an only child. But he's definitely no miracle." An un-ladylike snort escaped Hermione at the thought. Him, a miracle? Yeah, right. "Looks like I'll have to start picking out baby names." Ron nodded thoughtfully before opening his mouth. "But that kid will carry your name or ours. I'll be damned if it'll be tarnished by the name of Snape." Hermione smacked him lightly, admonishing him. "Ronald! Professor Snape is a good man. He's risked much and you know it." Harry shook his head. "I don't know about good Hermione. I mean you are pregnant. But old habits are hard to get over. I mean come on, do you think he'll suddenly be nice to us?" Nibbling her lip, Hermione shook her head. No, he wouldn't be nice. Hell, he might be meaner than ever. No doubt he thought her to be easy, something akin to a whore. But it wasn't true and she knew it. So did Harry, Ron, the Weasley's and most of the male upper classman at Hogwarts. She didn't jump into bed or onto a settee with just anybody. Harry and Ron had taken the news with a surprising amount of maturity. They were both outraged at Severus for having sex with her, let along getting her pregnant. But the big question on their minds was would she tell him? Harry and Ron promised to help her hide the pregnancy from the student body as long as possible but she couldn't hide it in good conscience from Severus. Not for long anyway. However, that bridge would be crossed when she finally arrived at its edge. In retrospect, Hermione was very glad that she had turned Professor, no, Headmistress McGonagall down when she had been offered the Head Girl position. At first she turned it down because of her Apprenticeship but now, with her pregnancy, there is no way she could have done it. Hermione was pulled from her thoughts when she found herself squished between Harry and Ron in a tight, crooked hug. "It'll be okay Hermione. We'll help you in whatever you need. Hell, you can marry me if you want." Harry's words were honest and they softened her heart. "Do you want to be Mrs. Potter?" Hermione chuckled and shook her head. "Thanks for the offer, but I'm just fine being Ms. Granger." Things were going to be okay. **********HP**********
