and he doesn't get it. PianoCompGeek81: More as in marriage or more as in physical stuff? ARomanticatHeart86: Both. I think. He's so different from me. I don't really see us 'panning out.' I'm ready to cut my losses and move on. He isn't. PianoCompGeek81: Different how? ARomanticatHeart86: Well, I went to college. University of Arizona with a degree in English Literature. I'm currently working as an editor for a small publishing house in the Phoenix area. Jake, my whatever he is, is a mechanic and isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. PianoCompGeek81: Ah…intellectually, you aren't stimulated. ARomanticatHeart86: You can definitely say that. His responses to my questions are monosyllabic grunts. He wouldn't even begin to understand our conversation. Jeez! He's one step up from caveman. PianoCompGeek81: I'm sorry :-(. So, what happened? The fight, I mean. ARomanticatHeart86: I wanted to go to this exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum. Jake refuses to go. He doesn't want to get 'all dressed up.' When he doesn't wear his coveralls, he dresses up. I demanded he take me and if he valued our relationship, he would. Suffice it to say, he left. Right now, I'm downloading some Rachmaninoff and chatting with you. Enough about me. Tell me about you. PianoCompGeek81: I'm pretty boring, really. I went to MIT with a degree in Computer Information Technology. I got a Masters from Keller Graduate School at Northwestern in Business. I live in Chicago and share responsibilities in running Whitlock Technologies with my best friend, Jasper. ARomanticatHeart86: Holy shit! I have your security program on my computer! Don't you spend all day on the computer? PianoCompGeek81 : Ah, yes. And you're probably wondering why I'm the computer now? ARomanticatHeart86: Yes, sir. PianoCompGeek81: I can be me. ARomanticatHeart86: Interesting… I would like to get to know you, Edward. You seem interesting. What's your email address? I blew out a breath and stared at the screen. This woman in Phoenix was asking for my email address. Should I give it or pretend I lost the connection. ARomanticatHeart86: I know you're there, Edward. Send me the damn address. Here's mine… Bella sent her address. "You can do this, Edward. It's not like she'll actually email you. No harm no foul," I said as I typed in my email address. My hand hovered the enter button before I hit it, sending my email address to my new 'friend?' Is that what Bella is? A friend? ARomanticatHeart86: Was that so hard? PianoCompGeek81: No. It's pretty late here and I have to work tomorrow. It was really nice talking with you, Bella. I hope we do it again soon. ARomanticatHeart86: Me too, Edward. Have a good day at work tomorrow. xx Bella left the room and signed off. I did the same and ran my hands through my hair. I felt something in my belly that I never felt before. I don't know this girl. This woman. Yet, I was experiencing some level of attraction. Was it because she 'kissed' me with her little x's? Was it because we carried on an intelligent conversation? I shook it off and remembered she had a 'sometimes boyfriend.' Unavailable. And lives in PHOENIX. Ever hear of plane, Edward? Big things with wings? They fly you to different parts of the world. You can take one to Phoenix. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. She could be a serial killer with a dragon tattoo on her forehead. My email indicated that I had a new message. I opened it up and it was from Bella. To: Edward Cullen From: Bella Dwyer Re: Conversation Dear Edward, You seemed really sweet online. I thoroughly enjoyed talking to you. Your knowledge about music is quite impressive. I'm also impressed that you are so accomplished at a relatively young age. I'll admit, I Googled you. When you run an up and coming tech company, you have info out there. But, I was actually looking for a picture. I wanted to put a face with the name and the brilliant man who was responding to me. Alas, no pictures of Edward Cullen. Damn it. Anyhoozle, I'm not sure if your mind works like mine. If you want to put a face to the name/person. So, I attached a recent photo. I hope that you can do the same so I can 'see' you. You could be five hundred pounds and balding and I don't care. I just want to have a visual. However, if you're 6'2" and hot, EVEN better! Just kidding ;-). I'm planning on being online tomorrow night if you want to chat. And I'm rambling. Sleep tight, Mr. Cullen. Yours in music, Bella Dwyer xx ATTACHMENT: I clicked on the attachment and downloaded it. The picture showed a young woman, about my age, perhaps a bit younger, sitting on the edge of the Grand Canyon. She had long mahogany hair that had a slight curl. Her face was heart shaped. Her lips were pink and pouty. On her upturned nose was a pair of glasses that covered chocolatey brown eyes. Her smile was genuine and kind. Her body was petite and curvy in all of the right places. Her skin was alabaster and a slight pink tint to it. My khakis grew tight and I never felt anything like this. I was physically attracted to this girl. This woman. She was beauty epitomized. Her name suited her and I was staring at her picture intently. With a few keystrokes, I printed out the picture and took it to my bedroom. Where I did something I had never done before. I jerked off to Bella's picture. What have I been missing for 30 years? A/N: So here's Edward's story…I hope you liked it so far. Our poor virgin Geekward. Up next will be Bella's back story. It'll probably start off in 3 rd person like Edwards and then morph into first person. However, these two chapters will be the only ones like this. Leave me love! xoxox
