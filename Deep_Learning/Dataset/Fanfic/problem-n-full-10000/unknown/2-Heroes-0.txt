Pippin cheerfully answered back. "May we come in?" Frodo asked. "I need to use the bathroom ever so badly." Sam yelled. "Shutup Sam you have a tiny penis, how long does it take you to urinate with that thing?" Frodo asked. "I'll have you know I can waterfall with it." Sam answered. Mary threw up. The gatekeeper opened the gate for them as they ran inside except for Pippin who was walking slow and proud. "Hey you, hobbit, I'll buy them oranges off ye." A human said to Pippin. "What oranges?" Pippin asked. "The ones in ye underwear." The man answered back. "Not for sale mate." Pippin proudly said as he tried to catch up with the gang. "Now to find the tavern…" Frodo said. Mary pointed dead ahead of them, "right there mates." They walked into the bar slowly and looked around for Gandalf. "I'm sorry Mr. Hobbit, haven't seen him in months." The keeper said. There was a dark hooded man sitting in the corner next to a fireplace. The gang sat down at a table and ordered a round of beers. "Look at that guy in the corner," Frodo said, "he jacks off just like you Sam." Frodo finished as they all looked at the guy in the corner jacking off. Mary stood up and walked away. "See if you can find me a carrot!" Pippin yelled. The loud noise of all the people in the bar made it hard to hear what Pippin said. "Alright, so Gandalf isn't here but they do have a room for us to stay in and wait. I'm sure he'll be here soon." Sam said. "That faggot won't show up, he's an asshead. He's probably having wizard sex right now." Frodo stated. "Alright so we have to think up code names, can't be using our real names." Pippin insisted. "I'll be Jesus." Sam said proudly. "Shutup Sam, Jesus has a huge penis." Frodo insisted. "Why can't I be Jesus?" Sam questioned. "Whatever, you're Jesus." Pippin exclaimed. "I'll be Steven Spielberg." Frodo stated. "I'll be Genital Man." Pippin said. "I'll go ask Mary about his code name." Frodo said as he walked off to find Mary. "Sure I know a Baggins, Frodo Baggins, he's right over there." Mary said pointing at Frodo. "Noooo!" Frodo yelled as he tripped on someone's foot. As he landed, the ring went flying into the air. He tried to catch it with his hand. The man in the corner stood up and put on a pair of binoculars. "What's that ring then?" Pippin asked. "He's got to destroy it in Mordor." Sam answered. "Mordor?" Pippin questioned. "Well you see, it's a big scary place with lots of deadly monsters that'll suck the semen right out of you." Sam explained. "All of your semen?" Pippin asked. Sam nodded his head. The ring fell and as Frodo tried to catch it, he accidentally slipped his index finger on the ring and vanished. "What the hell?" Frodo said as he stared into the fiery depths of the eye. "Ahh!" Frodo yelled as he took the ring off and hid it in his pocket. He was back to the real world. Pippin ran up to Mary and proclaimed, "Wait a minute, you stole my line! I was supposed to blab out the Baggins name." Mary answered back "Nah it's me." The man in the corner tucked his penis back into his pants, grabbed Sam and Frodo and brought them upstairs. "For one so small, you draw a large amount of attention to yourself." The man said to Frodo. "Step away you!" Sam yelled. "Easy friend, I mean you no harm. My name is Aragorn." The man said. "I know that ring you hold, I've seen it before with my own 3 eyes." Aragorn stated. "Three?" Sam asked. "Yes, three." Aragorn confirmed. Meanwhile Mary and Pippin were downstairs drinking colored beer and dancing to some of the most retarded songs in all of middle-earth. "How much for your pants?" Pippin asked a man. "I'll take those oranges for it." He said. "Sure thing." So the deal was made and Pippin finally had pants again. "I was getting sick and tired of watching your underwear." Mary said. "That's not what I heard." Pippin said while raising his eyebrows. "You're a fag." Mary stated. "Wait a minute, where'd Sam go?" Pippin asked. "Oh shit, we have to help him rescue Frodo!" Mary answered. So they ran upstairs in search of Frodo and found him in the closest room. "I'm going to kick your ass." Pippin said to Aragorn. "With what? Oranges?" Aragorn asked. "Are you frightened?" Aragorn asked Frodo. "Yes." Frodo answered. "Not nearly frightened enough." Aragorn said. "Bill, what the hell is going on here? Aragorn's done nothing but copy the original storyline's script since he came into the picture." The camera man complained. "No! Peter Jackson's going to sue us!" Bill yelled. "What should we do?" The camera man asked. "Pinch his nose." Bill suggested. The camera man reached out and pinched Aragorn's nose. Aragorn began swatting at the air in front of him. "What the hell's the matter with him?" Mary asked. "Not enough sex." Pippin answered. "Maybe he has a small penis?" Sam insisted. "Oh shut up Sam, you're the smallest it gets." Frodo snapped back. "Ahh! It's eating my brain!" Aragorn yelled. Then he stopped still. "Haha, penis." He said. "Is it me or did he just completely lose it?" Mary asked. "Lose what?" Pippin asked. "We should get some sleep, and wait for Gandalf to arrive." Frodo suggested. Then Aragorn went back to normal, "No! We must move out as soon as possible, I'll give you a few hours to sleep but as soon as the wraiths show up, we're leaving. We must set up a trap in the tavern across the way." Aragorn stated. "He's got a split personality!" Pippin yelled. "Oh lord…" Mary said. "That's rather odd, he seemed normal a few minutes ago." Sam stated.
