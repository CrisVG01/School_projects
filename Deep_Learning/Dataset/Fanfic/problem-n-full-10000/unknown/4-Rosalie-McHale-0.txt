specific detail, but I guessed that no matter how I looked at him, he would be perfect at every angle. Inhumanely beautiful. "The people you are ogling." Jessica rolled her eyes. "They live with Dr. Cullen. The two blondes, Jasper and Rosalie are like, their niece and nephew or something. Something happened to their parents so Dr. Cullen and his wife Esme took them in. They both work at the hospital. But before that they adopted Alice, the little one who just left and Emmett the big one, and. . . the one with red hair." Just then, he turned to look at us. I caught his eye. We stared at each other for a moment. His dark eyes did something to my body I couldn't quite describe. I couldn't breath. His lips pulled up into a one sided smirk, then his eyes released me and he stared back at nothing. Oh god. I whipped my head back to Jessica. "Oh my god. Yeah, that was Edward." She giggled. "He's dreamy obviously. But apparently he's too good for any of the girls here." Her tone had a slight edge to it. I wondered when she had been turned down by him. I nodded. Obviously he's too good for anyone here. Just look at him. I tried to peek around my shoulder for another glance, but he was looking my way again. Shit. He looked kind of frustrated, his eyebrows turned down. "But they're all together." Jessica kept on. "Like. . . together together. Rosalie and Emmett and Alice and Jasper. They're a thing and they live together. Isn't that insane?" I shrugged. "They're not related." I wanted to defend them. It was weird though. It would be gossip even in a more progressive town. "Dr. Cullen is like some adoptive parent matchmaker." Logan chimed in. "If he knows more chicks like Rosalie. . . maybe he can adopt me to." Mikala punched him in the arm. "Don't be gross." "What?" Logan replied. "She's hot. Right, Mike?" A boy named Mike I completely overlooked piped up. "Huh? Oh. Yeah. Rosalie? Hot." Of course they would think Rosalie was most gorgeous. She was pretty. But there was something about Edward. He stood out to me above all of them. A God. Whoever he ended up marrying would be lucky and entirely unworthy. Jessica rolled her eyes at Mike. She grabbed my arm meaningfully. "So what class do you have next?" "Biology." "Rats. I'm not in that one. I think Mike is though." The bell rang then as if on queue and I followed Mikayla's brother to my next class. "Hey, you must be Beaufort Swan." The teacher angled towards me when we walked in. "We've been looking forward to having you. Let's see. There's an empty seat next to Edward. We're starting chapter three today." I gulped. Edward. The boy I was looking at in lunch. Of course. Of all the rotten luck in the world. The most gorgeous, untouchable guy in the world and I would have to sit next to him. Suffer in silence, I believe is the phrase? I turned slowly towards the desk. There he was, a greek god. Edward Cullen. His bronze hair swept up like he just went running. He had on a leather jacket that hugged him in all the right places. Damn. Don't stare. Don't stare. Don't stare. He moved his things from what would be my side of the desk. "Hi." I tried to say cooly. Stiffly, he nodded, jaw tight towards my direction and then snapped his head back towards the front of the class. Yikes. Do I smell? I ruffled my hair with my left hand, while I tried to smell my armpit. Just to check. I heard his chair scoot further away from me. His hands were balled tightly on his lap. Good job, Beau. First day of school, you've met the sexiest guy you've ever seen and he can't even look at me. Cool. Great. Awesome. I didn't understand his reaction. Maybe it wasn't me. It couldn't have been. I'm a decent guy with superb hygeine. I had only said, "hi" to him. There was no way his pained and angry posture was because of me. Still though, I felt like it was my fault. I peeked up at him and his eyes were pitch black. I felt a small amount of fear well up in my stomach, but it settled back down. Nothing that beautiful should be so. . . scary. When class ended, Edward zipped out of class so fast I barely saw it. It hurt. I don't know why. But it hurt. Mike and Mikayla were waiting at the door. "Hey Beau. You have gym next right?" "Oh yeah." "Cool, I'll show you." Mikayla grabbed my arm and lead me off to my least favorite subject. This day was only getting better. At the end of the day I went back to the office to hand in some paperwork. He was there. Edward. He was speaking to the receptionist. His voice was even sexy. Damn. "I could take it next semester." His voice was pleading. "Sorry, dear. But there isn't another class open in that period." The administrator responded. He turned around and his eyes, black and dangerous stared daggers into me. "I guess I'll just have to endure it." He said through gritted teeth as he brushed past me. Well. That couldn't be a coincidence. This was definitely about me, right? I don't know what I did. He acted like I killed his father and raped his sister. What's his deal? I'm speechless as I hand in my paperwork and walk to my car. I reached the parking lot just in time to see a silver volvo speeding out of sight. AN: Wow. I didn't expect anybody to read this. Thank you for following! There are lemons but it comes about naturally. It's a journey for these boys. So it makes it better. - Rosalie
