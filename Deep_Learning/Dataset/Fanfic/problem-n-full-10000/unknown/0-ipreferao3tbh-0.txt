Sirius yelled. "Not these - these people!" He was thinking that Dumbledore may have gone even loonier than he was now to think that Harry should be left with these people. James, who gave Dumbledore slightly more credit, said "They can't be his first choice. I wouldn't want pass any of you over these guys, but I know he knows that." " You ... here!" "Listen to her, Dumbledore." Peter finally started speaking again. " It's ... letter." "Oh yes, a fucking letter will explain everything. That's all they need, a single letter." " A letter?" ... letter? "it better be a big letter." These ...Harry - No one wanted to mention the elephant in the room on that one. every ... name!" " Exactly," ... it?" "I agree." James said. "You can't sit there and think this family is the one he should grow into?" Sirius argued. James sighed. "No, I wish there was any other family that he could go into, but that's a lot for one boy to grow into. And I trust Dumbledore's judgement. If he says this is the way, then this is the way." "Dumbledore never did lead me astray before." Remus added in. "I wouldn't make this choice if I was in charge, but it can't be worse than the alternative. It can't be." Peter, who sat there thinking that this is the worst idea of the bunch and something he desperately, desperately, does not want this choice to be made for his best friend's child, never disagreed in an argument. There's always a nagging voice in the back of his head that stops him from disagreeing with them, in case they suddenly feel a trio is better and he's left alone, again, powerless. He never wants to feel powerless again. "I trust him, too." Which was not technically a lie. Professor McGonagall ... it. " Hagrid's bringing him." " You ... this?" "There's very few people I trust with the life of my son more than Hagrid." " I ... Dumbledore. " I'm ... careless. "He's not going to be careless in a situation like this." James said certainly. He ... that?" A ... them. "Is that mine?" Sirius asked, finally getting some of his pep back. "I think it might be yours." His happiness was contagious and Remus smiled warmly. If ... dolphins. "HAGRID!" They all cheered. In ... blankets. "Harry!" They all cheered, not as loud. " Hagrid," ...motorcycle?" " Borrowed it, ... me. "Hell yeah!" Sirius cheered. I've got him, sir." " No...there?" " No, ...destroyed, A pang of hurt washed through James as he remembered how old that house really is, but then remembered that he dies in it, so his perspective is put in check. but ...Bristol." Dumbledore ... hair "Ooo, he got the Potter hair." James winched. "Sorry, kid." over ... lightning. " Is ... Professor McGonagall. " Yes," ... forever." "The ladies love scars." "What do you know about what ladies love?" "I know a lot about what ladies like." He winked. "Couldn't ... Dumbledore?" "Even ... Underground. "Useful." Well - ... with." "I would like to think that the process of giving my son a new family isn't something you get over with, but okay." Dumbledore ... house. "Could I ... Hagrid. "Oh, Hagrid." He ... dog. "Merlin, I'm going to start crying again." Peter joked, but not really. " Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "Ha." " you'll wake the Muggles!" "Let the man cry, Minnie. I just died, to hell with the Muggles." " S-s-sorry," ... Muggles - " "I'm going to have to give Hagrid a hug sometime soon." James said. " Yes, ... Hagrid, "Kinda cold there, McGonagall." or ... two. "Wait, you're not even going to knock on the door?" James asked. "You're just going to leave him there all night?" "And it's still only midnight. Does Dumbledore know anything about kids younger than 11?" For ... out. " Well," ... celebrations." "I feel like this sort of thing would dampen anybody's mood for parties. Even Padfoot's." "Partying, yes. Drinking? Hell no." " Yeah," ... back. "If he could also give me my godson, then that would be great too." "How do you know you're the godfather?" Remus asked. Sirius gestured to have James answer. "I already promised Sirius my first son." James said. "You have either my first daughter or my second son. Peter either gets the second daughter, third son, or first horse." "I'll get to be the godfather of a horse? I love it." G'night, ... sir." Wiping ...night. "She was worried about Hagrid waking the Muggles but not my motorcycle?" " I ... reply. Dumbledore ... Put-Outer. "Still hate that name." He ... four. "There's still time to go over and knock on the door, you know, no pressure." " Good luck ,... gone. A ... Dudleyâ€¦ "Oh Merlin, that brat." He ... lived!" Remus was silent as he finished the chapter, and besides Sirius saying a sarcastic "Poetic." referring to the last sentence, they just looked at each other for a moment. "It's getting late." James finally said, and he was right. If they had a window outside they could see that the sun was starting to set and curfew was about to be set in. "Oh come on," Sirius said. "You can't tell me you don't want to read as much as we can right now." "I feel like we can't keep this to just ourselves." Was all he said, and he got up and left the Room of Requirement. They followed behind him, shortly. (Author Notes: in my fic, they take NEWTS in the 6th year as well as the 7th, everyone's at least a lil gay, I change canon trivia at will, and this is pretty much MST3K fanfiction with a Marauders skin. Sirius is Tom Servo, obviously. Also no harm meant to all Harvey's and Harold's.) (original format posted elsewhere where it allows it. PM me for link if you want it.)
