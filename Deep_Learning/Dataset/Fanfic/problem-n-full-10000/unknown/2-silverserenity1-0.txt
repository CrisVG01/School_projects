let out a snarl "I wish you much happiness. Everyone." Gandalf said smiling. The hobbits hugged him. As did Aragorn and Legolas. Then Gandalf started to chant. They all clutched their things tightly. A wind started to pick up. The clouds grew dark. A glowing circle appeared. They all stepped in front of it. 'I'm coming back Jo. I kept my promise.' Aragorn said and smiled. Knowing he was going to see her. **************************************************************************** **** "Everything is set!" Jo said aloud fixing one the napkins on the table. She smoothed her black dress down. She lit the candles. The doorbell rang. She smiled. 'He's here.' She walked to the door. Her black stilettos clicking on the wooden floor. She opened the door and gasped. She stared at the man in front of her. "Jo!" he said. Sean stood there with a huge bouquet of 2 dozen red and white roses. "Oh Sean!" she said taking them. "I knew you'd like them." he said. "Like them. I love them." she said and kissed him. "I knew you would." He said. He grinned. His white teeth shining brightly. His wavy blonde hair perfect. His green eyes focusing on her gray ones. "It's been awhile since I've gotten a kiss." "I hope it has been." Jo said. He chuckled. "God. I missed you." he said. "Ditto." She said. "Ah! Jo is this for me?" Sean asked. He stood in front of the table. "No actually it's for my other boyfriend who should be arriving shortly." Jo joked. He laughed. He wrapped his arms around her waist. He leaned into kiss her. Then the doorbell rang. They both turned to look at it. "Boy Jo. You weren't kidding bout the other boyfriend." He said. She stepped away from him. "Shut up. I wonder who that could be." Jo said. She walked over to the door. She opened it and groaned. "I couldn't help but notice that young Sean arrived at your apartment." Mrs. Bailey said with her normal pink rollers in her hair and flowery robe on. "I bet you couldn't." Jo mumbled. "Now I want to warn you! I don't want any noises coming from your apartment that are inappropriate and..." Mrs. Bailey said. "Oh! Mrs. Bailey how could you ever think that of us? Honey, can you bring down the whips and chains from the closet?" Sean asked. "Of course, darling." Jo said. "Bye, Mrs. Bailey! As you know I was in Paris for a long time, so me and Jo have a lot of catching up to do." Sean said smiling and closed the door in front of a very shocked Mrs. Bailey's face. Jo laughed. "Now I remember why I love you so much." Jo said wrapping her arms around his neck. They were about to kiss again when they heard Mrs. Bailey yell in the hallway: "Oh no! Not you lot again!" "Ugh! God! Cant that woman shut up!" Jo said. He smirked. He pulled her close; their lips were about to touch when there was a knock on the door...again. "Ugh! Jesus Christ Mrs. Bailey!" Jo said angrily opening the door. She then gasped. "Oh my gosh..." she said putting a hand to her chest. The familiar six men grinned at her. "Jo!" they all said. "Hello Jo." Aragorn said smiling. "H...H...Hi." She stuttered then her eyes rolled back and she fainted. **************************************************************************** ***** "Jo! Jo! Can you hear me?" someone called. Jo groaned. She had a massive headache. "Can you just lower your voice a tad bit." Jo said opening her eyes slowly. Seven men were leaned over her. She jumped. "Are you okay?" Sean asked. "Um....I don't think so." Jo said rubbing the back of her head. "You should lie down." Aragorn said grabbing her arm. "Hey, Hey. Who exactly are you guys." Sean asked. "We're here to see Jo and the girls." Pippin said. "Girls...Oh, you mean Trinity and them!" Sean said. The guys nodded grinning. "Ah. You must be the ones who were at war! Well just so you know, the whole country appreciates what you've done for us." Sean said putting his hand on Frodo's shoulder. Aragorn stared at Jo. Then he turned to Sean. "Who are you?" he demanded. "Oh! I'm soo sorry. I'm Sean Fitzpatrick. Jo's boyfriend." He said extending his hand. The guys stared wide eyed at Jo. She looked away. "Um...This is Aragorn, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Sam and Legolas." Jo said. "My. Those are some strange names." Sean said. "My. Jo must have been desperate while I was gone to be with you." Aragorn said nastily. Sean looked taken aback. "Um! How about you all sit down. I'll call the girls to come pick you up." Jo said standing in front of the guys. "Nonsense! The girls can come here and spend some time with the guys before they leave! I haven't seen them in awhile." Sean said. "Yes...But what about dinner ...." Jo said. "Ah! We can have dinner some other time, Jo." Sean said. "But.... ok." Jo said. Sean kissed her on the cheek and went to the phone. Jo looked at Aragorn. He stared at her with a hard expression. "Aragorn...." She started. "You know its amazing. We make a promise. A promise that I would come back to you. And I was the fool to believe that we could have a promise kept." He said simply and walked away. Jo breathed in deeply. She felt her heart tear. "Whoa! Marley calm down!" Sean said pulling the phone from his ear. Jo looked at Sean and shook her head. She blew out the candles on the table. **************************************************************************** ***** AN: AAAAAAAAH! Finally the first chapter is done! I hope you all liked!
