I get the aloe rub out of the First Aid Kit. I put some on a paper towel and rub it gently over her burn. I cover it with a bandage. I give her the bottle of aloe rub and a few fresh bandages so she can switch it out on her own. "Your turn.' I tell Haymitch. I read his burn again H.A. I look and see that his is not as bruised as Effie's. I look think of what I should treat a medium burn with. First I take another antiseptic wipe and clean his burn. It still stings. I take an aloe lotion which is less intense and rub that on his burn. I also mix a pain relief powder into a pudding for both of them. It should really help the pain. They leave once I'm done treating them. I guess we aren't doing anything today. I run to the stairs and go to level T. Training. We don't have training actually scheduled for 2 days. Tomorrows is the Tribute Parade so our stylists are prepping us tonight. I arrive at level T and I walk into a lobby with couches and a few tables. There is a door with a huge sign that reads : TRAINING HALL. "Are you Prim?" says someone. I look to them. "Yes who are you?" I ask. "I'm Cinna your stylist." Cinna says. "Aren't we meeting tonight?" I ask. "Plans changed so we are meeting now." He says. "Follow me." I follow Cinna through a door and into a dressing room with a big bathroom, a desk and couch. He tells me to sit. He sits across from me in a chair. "Sorry this is so sudden I just had to change plans." He apologizes. "That's ok I didn't have anything to do anyway." I assure him. "So the tribute parade is tomorrow and I need to fix you up. Get undressed and into the bath I ran for you." He says. I do as he says and after my bath he has me get into a robe. I don't really like having to undress in front of him but I guess I have to. He sits me in a chair and waxes my legs. It hurts horribly. He next waxes my arms. I'm like a hairless cat. He comments that he likes my braids. I told him my sister does them for me. He clips and files my nails. He paints them black. He puts me into a black jumpsuit representing coal from District 12. "Is that it?" I ask. "Tomorrow at the parade I'm going to light your suit with fake flames. It will look real but won't burn or be hot at all." He assures me. I don't really believe him. At least I will be different from every past tribute. Usually the costumes are awful. Once he lets me leave I go to dinner. Tonight's meal is fried chicken, corn on the cob,and lamb stew with dried plums on rice. I also help myself to cookies and cream ice cream. I go back up to my room after saying goodnight to everyone. I lay in bed for 3 hours not being able to sleep. It's 12P.M. Didn't this just happen last night? ,I think. I do the same thing as yesterday and go to the roof. The lights are still beautiful. I run over and jump off the building. "OH my god!" I hear someone yell form the roof. The force field catches me and pulls me back up. I land on the ledge sitting there calmly. I turn to see a girl, my age, sitting on the ledge too. "Force fields for suicidal tributes." I say smiling at her. Copying Gale. She laughs. "I'm from Disrict 11. How about you?"She asks. "12. My name's Prim. How about you?" I say winking. "Rue. You couldn't sleep?" she asks. "Nope, you either I assume." I say. She shakes her head. "How'd you know the force field was there?" Rue asks. "Someone told me." I say mysteriously. "Want to try jumping? I'll do it with you." I tell her. "Um.. Well sure." Rue says. We stand next to each other on the ledge. She seems scared so she grabs for my hand. We count. 1...2...3... There must have been a glitch in the force field and it couldn't hold both of us because next thing I know I'm being held up but Rue is dangling in the wind. I pull her up into the force field zone. We sit on a invisible bench looking out on the city. "It's beautiful..." We say at the same time. "That was awesome!" Rue says. The force field pulls us back up to the roof. "I'm hungry because I haven't eaten all day."I say "Same here!" Rue says. "You thinking what I'm thinking?" I ask. She nods. We race down to the dining level. And I learn we both hate elevators. So we take the stairs. I really like this girl which is horrible because on Saturday we have to go to an arena and fight to the death. I don't plan on killing anyone. I'm going to hide. Hide until every last person has killed each other. I can't alley with anyone because they will hide with me. And it would end up just being us left. And I think they would kill me. I've seen allies turn on each other before. We raid the fridge on Level D. We get cheese plates, crackers and fruit. We run back to the roof and feast. There are lawn chairs up there so we lounge in those. It's probably 1 A.M. and we are on the roof eating cheese. That thought makes me laugh. "What?" Rue asks. "It's probably 1 A.M. and we are on the roof eating cheese." I tell her laughing. It makes her laugh to. "Well we were hungry! Gosh!" Rue says smiling. We fall asleep in the lawn chairs.
