shifting from one foot to another. "Oh dear, you missed them. Edward and Bella left for their honeymoon last night." Esme informed. Jacob rubbed his chest where his heart lay as he felt a sharp pain. It was too late. He couldn't tell Edward. It felt like his heart was shrinking away in his chest and it made it difficult to breath. "Oh." Jacob whispered sadly. "Jacob, dear why don't you come inside?" Esme said offered, thinking that Jacob was sick. Jacob was going to decline, but Esme was already moving aside and pulling him in. He stood silently in the hallway not knowing what to do. "Is everything okay?" Esme asked leading Jacob toward the living room. "You can tell that easily?" Jacob asked. "Call it a mother's intuition." Esme said with a smile. "You don't look well." "I'm sick." Jacob said and that's all he would say. "Then you should be resting at home." Esme said. "Why did you come out here looking for Edward and Bella?" "It's complicated." Jacob heard footsteps coming from the hallway. The Cullen children followed after the other walking into the living room. Carlisle was the last one to step in. They were going to kill him, that's Jacob thought and a part of him wished. "What is that dog doing here?" Rosalie growled in disgust. "Rosalie." Esme said sternly. "Jacob is our guest." "What brings you here Jacob?" Carlisle asked. "I was just leaving." Jacob said feeling like he was intruding in their home. He made a move to get up, but Esme held him still. "I invited him to come in." Esme said. "He is not welcomed here." Emmett said. "He tried to kill Edward." "He told you about that?" Jacob asked surprised. "Why wouldn't he?" Rosalie asked. "But he didn't." Alice said. "You ran off." "Yeah, I did. I couldn't do it." Jacob said. "He can't be trusted." Jasper said. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble." Jacob said and this time he stood up. "Why did you come?" Carlisle asked again. "I wanted to apologize to Bella and Edward." Jacob lied. "I wanted to apologize for wanting to attack Edward and for not attending the wedding." "They left already. They're going to be gone for a couple of months." Alice said. "Aren't honeymoon's like a week?" Jacob asked. "It's different for them." Alice said. Jacob knew what she meant. Bella wasn't supposed to make it back. He wondered how they were going to kill her. Was she going to come back a vampire? Then maybe Bella would kill him herself. "Why are we entertaining him?" Rosalie asked annoyed. "Edward and Bella are not here. You can leave now. Go home." "I don't have anywhere to go!" Jacob shouted. "Is that what you want to hear? Will that make you feel better? You don't even know me? Why do you hate me so much?" "Rosalie please step-out for a second." Carlisle instructed. Rosalie had been stunned quiet, but she kept glaring at him. Emmett took her by the hand and they both left. "What happened?" Esme asked. "Apparently, I am too involved with you guys. The pack kicked me out of home." "That makes no sense." Carlisle said confused. "We just worked together to battle the newborns and protect Bella." "You're not telling us something." Jasper said. "I… It's… Uh…" "Enough." Esme said standing up. "He doesn't have to talk about it." "I don't trust liars." Jasper simply said and stepped out. "I'm sorry." Jacob said. "I didn't mean to cause any of this." "Don't." Esme insisted. "My children are hardheaded." "I should…" Jacob began and pointed at the door. "Carlisle." Esme said. "He was kicked out because of us. It's only right if we take him in." "Think about the others." Carlisle said. "They are grown enough." Esme said sternly. "He is just a boy. He can't be on his own. I just can't let him go." "We are not at fault for the decisions the wolves make." Carlisle said. "I don't see a problem with it." Alice said. Jacob had almost forgotten that she was still in the room. "Are you sure?" Carlisle asked. "It's hard to see, can hardly see anything at all really. When I don't focus on him with us I can see us individually. We'll make it." "Carlisle?" Esme asked. Jacob wanted to interject that he could stay with Charlie, but this was for the best. If he stayed with Charlie he would have to be in Bella's room. He needed to be away, closer to Edward. Being with the Cullens was the closest he could get to him. "What do you plan on doing?" Carlisle asked. "Charlie is going to help get my school stuff transferred. I'm going to finish my last year here." "Charlie? Why can't you stay with him?" Carlisle asked. "Bella is going to die." Jacob stated. "I don't want to be around when that happens. I can't handle that." It wasn't a complete lie. Carlisle nodded in understanding. "Do you plan on getting a job?" He asked. "I'm only sixteen." "Sixteen?" Esme and Alice both said surprised. "You won't be able to find work." Carlisle said. "We can take care of him." Esme said. "He needs us." "You are just a child." Carlisle said. "We will do this legally." "Legally?" Jacob asked. "We can foster him." Esme said excited. "I will take care of it all." Carlisle said. "I can really stay with you guys?" Jacob asked. "Yes, but you will have rules. So don't think you can run around freely." Carlisle said. "Welcome to the family." Esme said and hugged him. "I'm going to make some calls." Carlisle said and walked out. "I'll go tell the others." Alice said. "Good luck." Jacob said. He wasn't sure how they were going to react, but he knew it wasn't good. None of this seemed like a good idea, but he had to at least try. This was just the beginning.
