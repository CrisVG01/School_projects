to scramble to put all of the things I had bought her in the oversized gift bag I managed to find, stuffing wrapping paper in around it. I heard the thunderous rumbling of Bella's old Chevy coming from the driveway and I hurried to throw away all of the extra scraps. Alice walked through the door first, her eyes meeting mine questioningly, clearly wondering about the gift situation. I nodded my head quickly, in response. Bella walked in next. She was wearing a tight, dark blue dress with long sleeves. It came just below her ass and I couldn't help but stare at her. She was stunning. Bella hardly wore makeup, and quite frankly, she didn't need to, but today she was all dolled up. I was no expert on makeup by any standards, but her eyes were darker and her lips were this pretty shade of pink. I wanted to kiss her, but I was afraid of messing it all up. She sauntered over to me and I could tell that she felt sexy. Just the way she was carrying herself was a thousand times more confident. Her small arms wrapped around me and she buried her head in my chest. I kissed her hair gently, afraid of messing that up too. "Are you ready for your present?" I whispered. She looked up at me, excited. "I can finally have it now?" I laughed at her, and touched the tip of her nose. "Yes." I grabbed the large silver bag and handed it to her. Her eyes lit up at the size of it and took it from me happily. I watched her move to sit on the large white sectional and place her present on the glass coffee table, holding my breath. I really hoped she liked it. It only took her a few seconds to pull all of the tissue paper off and pull out the box that held the turntable. She took one glance at the large picture printed on the top and nearly dropped it in her shock. "Oh my god. Edward! Oh my god !" Her eyes were wide and she eagerly dug into the bag for the three albums. I chuckled, relieved. I saw Alice smile at me, widely. Emmett came sprinting down the stairs loudly, wanting to see her open her presents. He smiled at her excitement like I did and walked over to her. "Hey, Bella! Nice, Edward. Good sav- job ." He quickly corrected himself before getting me in trouble and plopped himself on the couch. I was grateful for the catch. Emmett handed Bella a small, badly wrapped gift. It was awkwardly shaped and I wondered what it was. Bella seemed confused too, but she sent him a quick thanks and opened the odd present. It was a hot pink shot glass that had the word 'Princess' scrawled across it in black cursive. I laughed, as did Bella. "This is great, Emmett! Thanks." She hugged him, her tiny arms not even reaching the entire way around his huge frame. His eyes sparkled at her praise and he ruffled her hair. Alice almost growled at him for that one. She turned to me then. "Okay," she said, "Everyone else is meeting us there at eight, and it's almost seven now. We should get going." I nodded my head, "So, who's driving home?" Considering we were going to a bar, I had a feeling no one would be safe to drive. "Um," she hesitated, biting her lip. "Oh, come on, Alice! I'm not letting him drive my car!" "Would you rather yourself driving it home and getting in an accident or getting pulled over? Please, Edward. He's not going to drink," she begged. I sighed, and agreed grudgingly. I didn't like the idea of Alice's shitty boyfriend touching my car, let alone driving it. But, I did it for Bella. I wanted her to have fun on her birthday without having to worry about anything. We left, and I grabbed Bella's things so she would have them for when she got home tonight. Emmett called shotgun and climbed in next to me. Alice started handing out fake IDs once we were safely out of the town limits. I looked at her questioningly. "I thought you said…." She cut me off, "Just in case." Her smile was bright. "I like to keep all my bases covered." I chuckled, saying, "You think of everything, don't you?" "I try my best." "Why do we need these?" Bella was studying her fake ID with growing excitement. "We'll be there in a half hour. Be patient!" Alice scolded her. Bella grumbled to herself in response. Alice was right though, we would be there in no more than thirty minutes. The road rushed underneath my accelerating car and the center yellow line seemed to stretch on endlessly. I heard the chatting of the girls behind me, the music playing softly in the background, the shuffling of my brother as he pulled out his iPod, and all of it made a slight bubble of panic build in my throat, as if this would be the last time I would be with them like this. I briefly regretted not waiting until my parents returned so I could hug them goodbye. Where did that come from? I wondered briefly. I shook my head, willing the unease from my system. During my mental cleanse, I remembered the look on Emmett's face this morning and the sound of his distraught voice, "I just got a bad feeling. About tonight, I mean." I wondered if he was still feeling that way and chanced a glance at him. His eyes were down on his device, but after sensing my glance, he looked up at me, smiling. After a quick second, he seemed to see something in my face. "You okay, dude?" His smile fell. "Yeah…I just –" "Edward, look out!" Alice screamed. A/N : Hope you liked it.
