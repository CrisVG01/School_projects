with people who have a different faith, as long as the cultural background is similar." Again, he took some notes. "Now, what if your wife would ask you to go to church with her?" Dammit, this is more difficult than I thought. "I think, if it's really important to her, I'll go." That was my first outright lie today. I probably wouldn't. "What about children, Edward? Would you have your children baptized?" I knew there probably was no right answer as well as there was no wrong one, but I needed to stay consistent. "If it were for me, I wouldn't, but if my wife feels the need to, I won't get in the way." After a few more questions about my parents and a rendition of a typical Christmas at Casa Masen, Peter Nichols shook my hand, a smile on his face, and we parted ways. Only one more, then I had to pray for my hair to remain. ****TtK**** The last hurdle was Dr. Esme Platt. She'd seemed nice enough during that informational meeting, but she totally shocked me when she called and told me we weren't supposed to meet at her office or whatever; that she'd visit me at home to see my natural habitat. Although it was in Emmett's best interest to make me look as bad and ineligible as possible, he helped me in my herculean task of cleaning up our apartment, nonetheless. I pleaded with him, telling him even if I didn't get cast, that wouldn't mean parts of the interview wouldn't be aired anyway. He knew Rosalie would kill him if it looked like he was living in a pig sty for all the world to see, so he reluctantly started to pick up around the living room. I was just done mopping the kitchen floor when Dr. Platt knocked on the door. The camera crew following her into our living room was a little unfamiliar and strange, and left me with an unsettled feeling, but I guessed I had to endure it. After all, if I was indeed willing to follow through with their show, I'd have a lens in my face for weeks, and I couldn't let anyone suspect that was the last thing I wanted. I greeted the sociologist, who immediately asked me to call her "Esme," and led her over to the couch. Emmett, the coward, was hiding out in his bedroom as I entertained my guest. "This is nice," Esme stated as she took a seat. "It has a clear masculine touch, but everything is very well kept. You're living here with a roommate, right?" I poured her a glass of water from the bottle I'd placed on the table earlier. "Yeah, I live with my friend, Emmett. We bunked together in college and rented this place after graduation. He's working in graphic design." Esme nodded a few times, then took out a folder which probably held my questionnaire or her notes on it. "I need to get an idea of your background. So, tell me a bit about your parents and how you grew up." With an encouraging smile, she waited for me to talk about my family. "Well, my mom's a piano teacher, and my dad works as a judicial officer for Family Court in Newark, New Jersey. They were high school sweethearts and got married between freshman and sophomore year of college. They both graduated and had me right after. They wanted more children but my mom couldn't have any more after me. They're still madly in love and keep pestering me about when I'll finally get married, settle down and give them grandchildren." After the exhausting interview with Nichols, it was refreshing to actually be able to tell the truth. "So you grew up in an intact, loving, middle-class home." "That about sums it up, yes." We talked a bit more about my early years before she moved on to the present. "I see a vast amount of multimedia equipment in this room. Are you a computer gamer, Edward?" she asked with obvious amusement. Scratching the back of my neck, I contemplated an answer. "My friends and I play a lot, yes." "What else do you do for fun?" "I, um, I go to a gym once or twice a week, and I like to just hang out with my friends. Quiet stuff, mostly." So much for the truth, but now comes the lie . "But lately, it really feels like something's missing. You know, I see my friends with their girlfriends and feel lonely in a crowd of people." Esme threw me a look full of sympathy, and I knew I had her right where I wanted her. After a few more questions about my job and financial situation, I showed her around the apartment. She lingered in my room for a bit longer than I might have liked before she finally said goodbye and left me to the gnawing curse of having to wait for their decision. Would I win a car or lose my hair? Only time could tell. ********TtK******** A/N: So, what do you think? I get if you don't like this Edward much — for now — but I promise he's not all bad. Next chapter, you'll learn about his preparations for the wedding. Here's a little teaser: … " Mom, Dad, there's something I need to tell you." I looked up from my soup to find them both looking at me with different expressions. While my mother seemed to be excited for some reason, my father was rather apprehensive. I took a deep breath and started to break the news to them. " Well, I wanted to let you know that I'm getting married — in two weeks." … Will the Masens be happy? Shocked? Tell me what you think, here or on Facebook in my group Payton79's Fanfiction . Now, I wish you all a Very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. CU in two weeks.
