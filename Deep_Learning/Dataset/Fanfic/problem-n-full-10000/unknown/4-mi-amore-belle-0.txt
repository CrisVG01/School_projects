Before anyone had the time to process the hit straight between Richmond's eyes. The whole war break through. The Phoenix men was quick to shoot Demetri just as The Voltura men started shooting . The whole war break on the church. The people were running frantically between the gun's fire. The Phoenix men lead their children outside the church just like The Voltura. They only cared about their own children unknown to them Isabella lost in sea of people and gun. Her cries drowned out into sound of guns firing and people's scream. Her sobs were wrecking through her as saw people fell to the ground with blood oozing out of their body. Renee was pushing into the sea of bodies trying to find Charles. When she finally saw Charles her relief was short lived as Felix point the gun towards her husband unknown to him. She ran towards her husband and did the only things she could do. Charles was firing any Voltura he could see. He didn't knew what to do. He was terrified out of his mind for Renee and Isabella. He did the only things he could kill the Voltura's who was trying to kill them. He didn't notice a body slammed to him. It took him minutes to register that it was the body of his wife. He watched horrified Renee started to slumb into the ground. " RENEE! RENEE! STAY AWAKE. OPEN YOUR EYES LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME DARN IT," He cried out in agony as he saw his wife dying. He held her towards her chest as his body shooked with sobs. He cried out in pain as her wife's eyes open slightly and she said his last words, Her voice barely audible " I love you" " NO" Charles voice roared as say her beloved's soul slipping away. His pain turned into anger as he roared " YOU SON OF A BITCH I WILL KILâ€¦." his voice abruptly stopped as Felix bullet fired into his chest Even with death slowly clawing into him. His face found a smile as fell into the ground. His fingers managed to crawl to Renee hand and wrapped her small hands with his own board ones "I love you, too" In the distance Isabella saw both her mama and dada took their last breath. It was too much much for him to possess as fell to her knees. Shock shook her body as her body went limp Carlisle Cullen was rushing his wife to exist as killed whoever come in front of him.
