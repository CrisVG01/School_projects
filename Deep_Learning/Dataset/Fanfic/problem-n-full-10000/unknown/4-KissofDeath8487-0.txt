It was only ten o'clock. Emmett must have saw me checking it cause he looked at me a little weird. "What? Waiting on your boyfriend to call?" "No. I don't have one." "Awe…better for me then." "What's that suppose to mean?" "Well…you must like this." He said while wiggling his body around. "Cause I saw you staring a lot while the game was on." "Well…" I said blushing a little bit. "…your girlfriend wouldn't like you talking to another girl like that you know." "Doesn't matter. Don't have one. So do you?" "Do I what? Like that?" I motioned a up and down to his body. "Yeah." "Well…maybe." "Maybe? That's the girls answer for yes." "Look. I just found out my boyfr…ex as of today, has been cheating on me." "That Royce dude? I'd love to beat him to a pulp." "Why? And how did you know?" "Not going there, and hello! We go to school together. It's not that hard to see you walking around with a jerk like him on your arm." "oooookayyyy…..since when did you start hanging out with Edward and Alice? I've never seen you over here before." I said trying to move the conversation to something besides Royce. I was getting sick just thinking about his name. "Well we've been friends since school started. Edward and me have a few classes together. So does Alice and me. Last week was the first time I've been over. But you wouldn't know about that. Since you've been up Royce's butt the entire time." "Yeah. But things have changed. Are going to change from now on." "Well I hope so. You looked…I don't know. Unhappy? I mean you weren't yourself these past few weeks." "How would you know about that?" "Again, same school. Plus if you haven't noticed, we have some classes together." He said moving so he was sitting sideways on the couch, facing me. "So…wanna talk about it." "There's not much to talk about. I mean I found out that for the past year or so Royce has been sleeping with Jessica." I shook my head afterwards to try and get the thought of them two out of my mind. "Jessica Stanley? She's a slut as it is. Wouldn't surprise me if they have been at it longer than that." He said resting his head on the back of the couch, and looking at me. There were those butterflies again. What was it about this guy that would make those things happen? Smile? Maybe. Muscled chest and arms? Could be it. God to really think about it, he was really hot. But to top it off, he was getting me to open up to him. Which was one thing that only Alice was able to do. Maybe there could be something between us? Oh stop thinking Rose. It's never going to happen. "True. But I don't know. I really don't want to talk about all this. It kinda makes me sick to even think about him now." "I can tell. Which is why I'm not gonna push you. Whenever you wanna talk about it, I'm here. Kay?" "Kay. Your not like the other guys I've been around." "What you mean?" "I mean. You got me to open up. Which usually only Alice can do. There's something about you that's just I don't know." "Well that's a good thing. Right?" "Yeah. I guess you can say that. So why don't you have a girlfriend." "Don't know. Guess no one wants to be with me." "Oh come on. There has to be tons of girls at school that would line up to be with you." "If you say so. But I haven't found her yet." "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that." "No it's cool. Sometimes the truth hurts. But, you live and let die. Well at least that's what my mom says." "My dad says that too. But I rarely get to see him." "Why is that?" "Well he got a promotion at his job which sends him out of the state. Sometimes it sends him out of the country. Which is why most of the time I'm by myself at home or I'm over here." "I'm sorry to hear that." "It's okay. I kinda like it. But I wish I had someone to be there with me." "Well if you ever want someone to be with you, you can always call me." He said with a smile and trying to get me to lighten up some. "I'd like that. I mean I've never really sat down to talk to anyone the way I have with you. Guys I mean. I haven't been able to sit down with them. Or really have fun for that matter." "Well I'm all about some fun. Just ask Jacob. It's never a dull moment around me." "I bet. So….what was up with you kissing me?" "Oh…that…nothing." He looked ashamed when he said it. Something childlike coming out in him. Which I really liked. Maybe there could be something between us. That is if he would want it to be. "Oh come on. There had to be something behind it. Spill! I wanna know." I really was wanting to know. But, I was also wanting it to happen again. Just more…passion to it. "Well….I've always wanted to know what it would be like to kiss you. And you wouldn't shut up about the game. So…I told advantage of it I guess." "You wanted to know what it would be like?" "Yeah. Is that a bad thing?" "In a way yeah. But right now no." "Why's that?" "Cause I was wondering the same thing." I said dropping my head. "Wanna try it again?" He asked with that dimpled smile that I was falling in love with. That's what was happening here. I was starting to fall in love. With a guy that I didn't even know that well. But, hopefully would know more about in the days, weeks, months, or years to come.
