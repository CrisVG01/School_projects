////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// You must keep up appearances; reassure the people that things are under control. This unspoken mandate binds your hands and your tongue. You may not show emotion, may not weep. Not even at your father's funeral. Your sisters stand off to one side, their heads bowed beneath flowing black veils. A soft whimper comes from one of them. They are beautiful in their mourning clothes. For a month they, and you, will wear only black and gray, a sign of respect. Your son lets out a loud sniff . You place a bracing hand on his shoulder. Boromir is barely more than a babe, but already he mimics you. You hide your tears behind a mask of stone, and he tries his hardest to do likewise. Finduilas stands behind you, with little Faramir in her arms. She places a comforting hand on your shoulder, but you shrug it off. It is time. The pallbearers gently lower Ecthelion's embalmed body onto the prepared slab. They step back. The last moments are for you alone. The white rod of the Steward is still clasped in his lap. You lift it slowly. It's so simple—just bleached wood worn smooth by time. Is this what you've been preparing all your life to bear? It's heavier than you thought it would be. Your father's skin is cool and smooth. It doesn't feel like something that once lived. You place a gentle kiss on the waxen brow; one final gesture of love. For he did love you, you see now. Though perhaps he loved his city more. And perhaps that is no great crime. A single wet drop falls on the pale face, but you brush it away before anyone can see. When you step back, your face is graven stone. For a month you will wear only black and no minstrels will sing in the Citadel. You have a month to mourn, but only those few stolen seconds to grieve. You reach for Boromir's hand. If nothing else, you will not repeat Ecthelion's mistake. Your heir will never doubt that he is also a son, and dearly loved. As you leave the House of the Stewards, a herald blows a trumpet and takes up the cry. "Hail Denethor, Steward of Gondor!" You cast a silent glance over your shoulder. I shall return. ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The tavern is noisy, crowded, and dim, but even so they can sense his approach. For his part, the traveler takes no note of the rowdy patrons as he heads for his usual seat in the most shadowed corner. Their eyes follow him, though. They take in the worn green cloak, the stained clothes, the sword hilt gleaming dully. The hobbits among them notice his mud-caked boots and the knife they conceal. He's picked up a limp since the last time he darkened these doors. Most of the patrons return immediately to their tankards. A few of the bolder ones watch as he lifts a pipe and lights it. The glow of the embers throws shadows across a visage that seems as weathered as the face of a mountain and just as hard. Beneath the mask of grime, his face tightens slightly as if in pain. It is then that one of the patrons, his tongue loosened by ale, dares to speak. "So, you back again, Longshanks?" The Ranger's eyes dart across the room and the unfortunate speaker is trapped for a moment in their steely gaze. The patron swallows hard. He doesn't understand what he sees in those eyes—just that they seem very terrible and make him feel very small. The other man does nothing, though. After a moment he responds "For a time," in a soft voice that somehow carries easily. Then he looks away and the patron is free. Bending his head gratefully to his tankard, the man takes a fortifying draught before muttering "Strange fellow, that Strider." /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Faramir's world was in flames. His body was wracked by flashes of heat followed by bone-jarring cold, and over it all lingered a deep, crushing ache. A flickering light stabbed at his eyes, and he turned his head as best he could. He didn't want to awake to the world that had killed his brother and stolen his father and left his country in ruin. An anguished voice pierced the ringing in his ears. "My son . . ." As if the call were a summons, Faramir's eyes fluttered open of their own accord. The world was dark and bleary and stained orange and red. In his muddled state of mind, it seemed only natural that there should be fire without as well as within. But there was a figure silhouetted against the glare . . . For one moment out of eternity, the gray eyes of the father met those of the son. But the flames were rising. Now they were devouring the rich fur robe, now the white rod, now the pale flesh. Time seemed to slow. Faramir could only watch transfixed as greedy flames crisped his father's long hair, turned the white skin red, then black, then devoured it in great chunks so that the soot-blackened bone showed through. As the light slowly faded, Faramir's one lucid thought was a prayer. Please, let it be a nightmare. Please, let Father survive. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The next thing Faramir was aware of was a gentle voice in his ear. "Awake, son of Gondor." He opened his eyes, and for one wild moment, he thought his prayer had indeed been heard. For the man by his side was Denethor, or rather Denethor as he should have been. His face was stern and held the glory of departed kings, elsewhere remembered only in sculpture. But it also held love, and the strength and wisdom bred by long trials and many losses. The gray eyes met, and Faramir had a vision of things he'd thought gone from Middle Earth forever. Here was justice. Here was nobility. Here was the King Elessar. Fin
