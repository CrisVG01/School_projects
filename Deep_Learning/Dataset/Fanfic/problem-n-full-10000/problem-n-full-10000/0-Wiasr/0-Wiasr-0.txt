Merlin: The Great and Powerful I. Game Start! "How dreadful...to be caught up in a game and have no idea of the rules." ― Caroline Stevermer . "English Oak," Mr. Ollivander said, offering the wand. "Unicorn Hair, ten and three-fourths inches - slightly springy...go on, give it a wave." the man urged. Merlin Faulkner, although wary after the last wand had nearly set his mother on fire (Professor McGonagall, whom was accompanying them as an escort, saved his mother from injury with a hastily erected shield charm), obediently took the offered wand and, after a beat, gave it a wave. Silvery sparks flew out of it, almost looking as if shooting stars were emerging from the wand. "Oh, yes, that's the one." the wizard declared to the professor's polite clapping - his mother belatedly following suite. He started to smile, the glee of being an actual wizard with a real wand hitting him all at once, when loud, booming bells rang and the world went through a sudden rush of colors before bleaching to grayscale save for one thing. A single golden box floated before him, at eye level, with writing that reminded Merlin of the veranda text font that was itself copper in coloring.

[Close] Merlin glanced at his mother, who was frozen and colorless like an old black and white picture, before, with lack of any better idea, pressed the [Close] at the bottom of the golden box. The box disappeared, with a fwip! noise that vaguely reminded him of a message alert system, only for three more to take it's place. Idly, he wondered if there was a way to change the coloring of the thing - the copper and gold theme hurt to look at.

CHARACTER STATUS MERLIN FAULKNER Title: Fledgling Wizard (+2 WIL, +2 WIS) Level: 1 HP: 25/25 MP: 30/30 Stamina: 20/20 DEX: 5 AGI: 5 STR: 5 VIT: 7 WIL: 10 CHA: 5 WIS: 12 LUK: 10 [SPECIAL STATS] Point(s): 5 Merlin Faulkner is a rather quite and solitary boy who is often teased and called a "Mama's Boy" by his age-mates. Prior to turning eleven years old he received an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, thus his journey to becoming a full-fledged wizard has started. There are things in his past that might make the journey problematic, however... [Close] " Problematic. " Merlin hissed softly to himself, "What the fu-" Instinctively his eyes flitted to his - still grayscale and frozen - mother and he changed mid-word, "-dge is that supposed to mean?" After a beat, where staring at the sentence gave no answers, he dismissed that box and investigated the final one. MENU [Status] - [Skills] [Quests] - [Inventory] [Profile] - [Social] [Journal] - [Options] [Resume] "Resume, wha-" Merlin started to question when there was another sudden rush of color as the world unfroze and returned to how it was before the boxes appeared. Blankly, he also noted that the 'Menu' box had disappeared. The next moment, his mother was crushing him in a hug that - given he, for all that he remained calm (something he was distantly freaking out about) during the ordeal, was unnerved by how the world had... changed so abruptly - he made absolutely no move to get out of. He, in fact, returned the embrace wholeheartedly - even if the sudden rush of compliments made him flush. "That was fantastic! Absolutely beautiful - as if you created your very own meteor shower! I'm so proud , baby mine." Ping! Merlin's gaze automatically went toward the noise, finding a small box that stayed only for as long as it took him to read.

"Yes indeed," Mr. Ollivander said, "You are quite the match, you'll find that this wand will serve you well in a range of subjects." A beat where his mother finally released him, then- "That'll be seven galleons."

"Wait," he mused aloud, "If just saying 'resume' was the same as pushing resume , can I just-" he paused then, very clearly, said, "Close." The box disappeared and two more appeared with a ping! ping! "That..." he huffed, "Will definitely get old if new ones come with each one dismissed."

Though he couldn't tell if anything froze like last time, given he was alone in his room with curtains blocking the window, he could see how the world lost color and assumed that it had froze like earlier.

There are things in his past that might make the journey problematic, however... [Close] "That...is ominous, let me-" Merlin muttered, adding a point each to DEX and AGI so they were both at seven which left the point count at ten. "Right. So, how about Special Stats?" A new box appeared in front of the Character Status one. SPECIAL STATS Stat Point(s): 12 [H?]: 2 Kindness: 2 Faithful: 0 Honesty: 0 Hardwork: 0 [G?]: 0 Courage: 0 Bravery: 0 Nerve: 0 Chivalry: 0 [R?]: 4 Intelligence: 1 Creativity: 0 Learning: 1 Wit: 2 [S?]: 4 Ambition: 0 Cunning: 2 Leadership: 0 Resourcefulness: 2 [Close] Bemused and a bit dismayed over the question marks, Merlin sighed before pressing the [H?] button and reading the box only to open four more boxes when he pressed [Kindness], [Faithful], [Honesty] and [Hardwork]. " Kindness , the measure of how nice you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows a plus twenty percent bond xp gain, plus fifteen percent reputation xp gain, plus 10 percent loyalty xp gain, plus ten percent luck and plus five percent charisma." He read aloud, finding he could move the boxes if he just grabbed a corner and pulled. He moved the Kindness box so that it was above the next one. " Faithful, the measure of how reliable you are - this is a trait of H. This special stat allows fifteen percent loyalty xp gain, fifty percent boost to all stats on you if a person with a
