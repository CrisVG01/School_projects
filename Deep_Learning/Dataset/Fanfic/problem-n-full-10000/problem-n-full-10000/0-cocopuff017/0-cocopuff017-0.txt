((A/N: I know my first story isn't done yet but I seem to not have the motivation to write the next chapter TT^TT Perhaps when the opportunity arrives, I'll pick it up again. So here's a new story I've been having the strong urge to write. Let me warn you that Snape, Remus, Sirius, and Dobby are alive in this story. There will be multiple couples in this. OCC x Blaise; Draco x Hermione; Harry x Daphne; Sirius x Remus. The first three couples are the main couples. In the book it said Sirius and Narcissa are cousins but in here, they are siblings. The first chapter is mostly flash backs and explaining plus a semi dark Harry. Well I hope you guys will enjoy~)) Chapter 1 Loud murmuring filled the tense air as the people filled into the court room in large numbers, whispering amongst to each other to discuss the possible outcome in this court hearing of the century. Slowly one by one, each person sat down in their respective seats, each having their house signet embalmed on their chest. The double doors to the court room suddenly sprang open and a group of four people came marching in, making the chatter in the room quiet down for a minute. Once people realized who it was, the muttering commenced as well as the curious looks at the new comers. It's been known that the Potter twins and their guardians would come to see Pettigrew finally get put to justice. *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* Two pair of eyes scanned the crowded platform as the Hogwarts Express slowly pulled into the King's Cross station, searching for that familiar gaunt looking face. Instead, they saw a shaggy looking dog. "Paddfoot!" They shouted just as the train finally came to a halt. They scrambled to get their luggage from the overhead rack and rushed out to the platform. The black shaggy dog gave a friendly bark as it trotted up to them, meeting them in a group hug. *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* The twins sat in the couch in the sitting room as they watched Sirius clench and unclench his hands, making his nervousness more obvious. Harry sighed and reached over to stop his hand. "Sirius just come out with it." Those chocolate brown eyes softened a little as his body relaxed against the wingback chair. "You both now that I love you right?" Two pairs of eyes, one green and one blue, rolled and they couldn't help but smile. "Yes Sirius." Sirius leaned forward, looking at them straight in the eye. "I want to adopt the two of you." *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* The loud bang of the door rang through the mansion as Sirius came in with a rather euphoric look on his face. "Pups! Come down here I have a surprise for you!" Loud thumping of running footsteps vibrated from the ceiling as the man calmly sat down at the head of the dining table. "Father!" Two pair of voices cried out as two 13 year olds ran into the room, to only be lifted up onto the older man's lap, one on each leg. "I know you both aren't of age yet but... I want you both to choose which house we should live in. Stay here or should we go to the Potter mansion?" The twins were very smart. They knew the man had a huge resentment towards the Black Mansion and knew he was always loved the Potter Mansion. "We choose the Potter Mansion." *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* " You should be ashamed of yourself dear brother! You could have picked any other orphan but you pick those two?!" The automaton long forgotten as Harry and Annabelle silently walked towards the shouting. "I don't care what you think of me Cissy! Their father was like a brother to me and I vowed I would always take care of them. I love them as if they were my own and nothing can change that." Sirius growled as he gripped his wand tightly. Narcissa was about to say something when she saw something move in the corner of her vision. She quickly turned to see the twins standing silently as they watched. The woman let out an angry huff before walking back to the fireplace and disappeared as fast as she came. *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* " Harry and Annabelle Potter-Black is to return to live with their relatives for the remaining summer before they head back to Hogwarts for their fourth year while we investigate these charges." The sharp bang of the gavel against the wooden rang inside the court room as some cheers from some and grief from others permeated in the air. Harry and Annabelle got themselves out of Remus's clutches and ran into the arms of their loving father. They just couldn't fathom that someone would accuse this man of child abuse. Sirius pressed them tightly against his body as he tried not to cry. He lets out a shaky breath and pulled away to look at the twins. "I'll try to visit before you head back to Hogwarts but I doubt they'll let me this soon." *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* " Boy go do the laundry! Dudley needs his suit ready!" Aunt Petunia screeched as a young man stepped out of the kitchen. Harry groaned softly as he moved himself over to the laundry room. His sister was in the dining room cleaning the 'special' utensils for the dinner party tomorrow. The bell at the front door rang and Uncle Vernon's voice bellowed from the living room just as Annabelle was making her way to the front door. "Answer the door girl!" Annabelle rolled her eyes and opened the door to meet face to face with someone she and her twin cherished. "Father!" She cried out as she launched herself into the man's arms, wrapping her thin arms around him. Loud clattering and yelling came from inside the house and Harry stumbled into the walk way. "Father!" Before either were prepared, another set of arms came into the hug. After a little bit, they let the man go, each sporting a wide grin on their faces. "What are you doing here? I thought they allowed you to visit every Thursday?" Sirius chuckled and ruffled their hair which they both gladly took. "Fudge had to release me. Nobody could find evidence that I did anything and even if they did, the others that came on my behalf shot down their accusations. So this morning they let me go." Before the twins could do anything to celebrate the news, an all too familiar voice called out from within the dreadful house. "Who the bloody hell is it girl?!" Vernon yelled as the sound of him hauling his fat ass out of the arm chair but they seemed to not notice his words as a rather loud pop could be heard a little further away from Sirius, making the twins peek over his shoulders to see a familiar hair color and soft brown eyes. "Moony!" They yelled in unison as they were pulled into another set of arms with a different sensation; something similar to a mother's hug. "What the bloody hell is going on here?!" Instead of moving away from the werewolf, they stood by his side, watching as their father glared at their walrus of an uncle, who was standing in the door way and glaring at them with his beady eyes on his purple face. The little group left 15 minutes later without a single scratch…well except for Sirius who keeps on whining about his sore knuckles. Remus was all over him like a mother hen, kissing his 'sore' knuckles while the twins just scoffed at him. "Wuss." They said in unison. A sharp scream could be heard as the two kids ran down the street to escape from their father. *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* The front door swung open as Harry and Annabelle stepped in to see Winky patter over to them to take their wet winter jackets. They were into their fourth day home for the winter holidays of their fifth year and have just came back inside from playing in the snow. "No I'm telling you Harry she has the hots for you." Annabelle said in a teasing manner. Harry shook his head for the third time. "No she doesn't and you know I have Ginny Ann." Annabelle couldn't help but roll her eyes as she took off her shoes and made her way towards the family room where the TV was. Harry followed her and ran into her when she stopped walking abruptly. "What the hell-"Annabelle raised her hand to stop him and placed her finger to her lips. The two were silent and after a couple of second, Harry was about to tell his sister she had gone crazy when soft squeaks of the bed from upstairs could be heard with muffled moaning mixed in with it. The two immediately flushed bright red, instantly knew what was or rather, who was making those noises. To be honest they had contemplated on the idea of their father being gay and had feelings for a certain werewolf but to finally have that assumption actually come to life was a little surprising. They quickly snapped out of their frozen stupor and made their escape to the family room, turning on the TV to block out the moaning from the two floors up. A couple of minutes passed and sounds of heavy footsteps could be heard come down the stairs as well as casual conversation between two grown men. They immediately froze when they noticed the twins were in the kitchen with the sounds of the TV on the background. Harry gave them a smirk as he walked over and patted Sirius on the shoulder. "Father. You should really invest in silencing spells. We can hear you from down here." The twins left without witnessing the hard blush forming on Remus' cheeks. The man groaned as he leaned against the kitchen counter with two hands covering his face. "Oh Merlin…I just ruined your kids innocence." Sirius let out a booming laugh as he leaned over to kiss the side of his lover's head. "Innocence? Hardly." *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* The Great Hall was silent and dark as every student stood in line facing the front where the head table would have been. Annabelle stood there shivering a little from the coldness in the air. She was to be known as Cheyenne Gibbons while the Golden trio left to find the horcruxes. Neville gently reached over, giving her hand a gentle squeeze of comfort just as the door to the Great Hall swung open and the sounds of many footsteps could be heard walking towards the front as well as something heavy sliding across the floor in a fluid motion. Annabelle quickly squeezed her eyes closed when she heard the familiar sounds of hisses as if there was a conversation going on. 'Oh Merlin he's here…' She thought as she forced herself to look at the front, seeing the man of her life's nightmares sit on the chair Dumbledore would have sat, knowing full well no one could see through her glamour charms but couldn't help but feel she would found out. She quickly put up her mind blocks, hiding where her father and Remus has fled or where her dear brother has gone. Death eaters stood by him in a silent matter and one Annabelle quickly recognized. She saw those obsidian eyes above that familiar crooked nose, scanned over the crowd just like his Lord was doing and they stopped right on hers. She gulped as she saw them widen a little from recognition but quickly snapped out of it as the Dark Lord spoke to the students about the blood purity and the goal he planned to make. *~*~*~*:*~*~*~* It was another day of Cursing Neville Day in Defense Against the Dark Arts class and Carrow was having the time of his life. "You never learn do you Longbottom? Crucio!" The form on the floor
