The name's LeiloniParks. Normal day as usual. Boring. Hard. Tough. I don't care. Anyways….I was just picking a library book when Trevor Knocker bumped into me on purpose. "Oh, I'm sorry bookworm," he said sarcastically. I rolled my eyes at him and walked away. "Oh the baby's running away!" Trevor called after me. I stopped dead in my tracks. I slowly turned around and glared at him. His friends backed up. One stayed put though. He stepped forward and motioned for me to calm down. Who does he think he was? I don't know why, but I obeyed and turned back around and continued walking. "She's such a wimp," Trevor said. I hesitated for a few moments and heard grunting. When I turned around again, I saw the guy that motioned me to calm down on top of Trevor punching him. The guy's lucky the librarian wasn't here and there was no cameras. I ran to the guys and pulled him off Trevor. Trevor coughed up blood and stared at the guy that defended me who was breathing hard. I helped Trevor up and let him lean on me for support. "What's the matter with you, True?" Trevor asked the guy. I stared at the guy, True. He had defended me by beating up this guy. Wow. I was impressed. "Here," I said to True and handed over Trevor to him. "Make it up to him. Take him to the Nurse's Office. Tell him he's suicidal or something." "What?!" Trevor telled and the librarian popped her head out of the door to the office and shushed us. Jeez woman pop your head out when needed, I thought. "Just go!" I pointed to the door and they left. The friends of Trevor stared at me for a moment, then left as well. I went back to looking for a book. I looked for a good ten minutes. I couldn't find anything interesting. I sighed. Then True came back with a handful of books. He walked over to me. He held the books out to me. "Here. I knew you like to read this troubled relationships and adventure. So….Here. I hope you like it because it's all I got," True said quickly. I widened my eyes and then smiled a little. He smiled as well and we laughed. I took the books and kissed his cheek which made him slightly blush. He turned around and walked off fast. I laughed to myself gently. I sat down and opened the first book, labeled "Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief". Then it was bright and I was standing in the middle of a class. I looked around and nearly fainted. There. Percy Jackson. I saw him on the cover of the book. I pointed and, as a matter of fact, fainted. That was it. Over. I woke up. No! I was surrounded by kids and one in particular looked at me very concerned. Percy Jackson. I wanted to faint again. "What happened?!" yelled an unfamiliar voice. I saw a man in a wheelchair. I started remembering the books. I was in the middle of Yancy field trip. Boy was I lost. I sat up and heard a little clink! I had a chain of tiny charms that looked like books around my neck. I took off the first one. It was so tiny. I put it back on. I stood up. And took a step back. Bad choice. I almost stumbled into a teacher. I looked at her closely. "Sorry," I said and quickly walked away. I went to the restroom where a tour guide told me where it was. I locked the door and looked in the mirror. I took off my chain and held the first book in my palm. It grew into a larger book. I wanted to faint…..…. again. But managed to just gulp. I opened the first page and read the first lines. "Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my advice: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you at birth and try to lead a normal life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time it gets you killed in painful nasty ways." I got irritated. This guy was too much of a talker. I skimmed through the pages. I found out Percy was telling the story and he was twelve years old. He's a troubled kid and yatta yatta yatta yatta. was the guy on the wheelchair. was the lady I almost bumped into. I growled and left the bathroom. I closed the book and it shrinked. I hooked it on my chain. I saw the class getting back on the bus. I caught up them. I saw and stopped him. "I'm sorry for saying this and it might come out a little weird, but…...Are you aware of Percy Jackson's real identity?" "Excuse me?" said politely. I took a deep breath and pulled the book off my chain. I held it and it grew. 's eyes widened. "You're a centaur. I've read about you once. I'm stuck. In this book. This one," I held out the book. I saw letters changing places and making a new story. I pulled it back to me and read it. It said We waited on to get back in from talking with the girl that had fainted earlier. She held a book and was showing it to . "Whoa." "What?" asked interested. "I'm…..in….the…..book," I said slowly and carefully. "May I see this book?" said and I nodded. I gave to him and it snapped shut and shrinked. I stepped back and he nodded. "Your book. It only belongs to you. No one else can read it. Read it to me. The first page, please," he handed it back to me. I nodded. The book grew and I opened it. I read aloud. "Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. If you're reading this book because you think you might be one, my advice: close this book right now. Believe whatever lies your mom or dad told you at birth and try to lead a normal life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the times it gets you killed in painful and nasty ways-" he held up a hand to stop. "Do you know what happened back there in the museum and what happened to ?" asked. "Um. Hold on," I flipped through the pages and scanned them real quick. "Percy just defeated with your pen sword thingy. The Mist covered their minds except Percy's. Nancy Bobofit was pushed into a fountained. No. More like the water pulled her in. Percy's the son of…..Poseidon?" "Hm. Come. We will talk," he got on the bus and so did I. I sat by him and told him quotes from the story that already happened. He nodded and listened. Then sometimes the words would change and I'd see that Percy was staring at us. I'd turn around and see him staring. He'd go back to poking at the seat and talking to Grover. I smiled and returned to reading the book. "Oh, where are my manners?!" said interrupting me. "My name is-" " . A.k.a. Chiron with a real horse's ass," I said and we both laughed. "I like your movie lines better than your book ones. They're boring. And seeing you in real life..man I couldn't picture you in my head. I'd just read and go with the flow." "Did you read all these books?" /Chiron asked. I nodded and he stroked his small beard while thinking. "Can you be in the books without changing them?" "No. Percy already noticed me as I fainted and now I'm here." nodded thoughtfully. "Do you think you could tell us the future of us? Like what happens with Percy in this book?" "Um...I don't know…." I said and tilted my head. I saw through the mirror a guy shaking his head and staring at me. I recognized him. I flipped to the back of the book and found a picture to the author. The same guy. Rick Riordan. I looked back at the guy, but he was gone. I flipped back to the beginning. I counted to ten. "Sorry, Chiron. I can't," I said. "Okay. Then we will have to see how this ends up. We're here. Everybody up!" he yelled and got off. I smiled and shook my head. I waited till everyone to get off. The last two, Grover and Percy. "Hi!" Grover said enthusiastically. I laughed and nodded. "Hi to you, too. Hi," I said to Percy. He nodded. "My name's Percy. What's yours?" he asked. "Leiloni. Call me Leila," I said and shook his hand. I shook Grover's hand as well. "Grover," he said and I smiled. We got off the bus and Grover pulled me a side. Literally. He almost pulled my arm off. It hurt. "Whoa!" I said and he squinted at me. "Who are you?!" Grover yelled. I thought about my answer. I smiled. Let's have some fun. "Ooohhh. So. You noticed something off. How I escaped the Mist, maybe? Or how I know you're a satyr? Or how I know you're a protector? Or maybe is it the way I already knew who Percy was and his parent was named Sally? Or? Maybe it's how you're in a book?! " He tilted his head. I slapped him up side the head. "I'm not a bad guy. Or fury. Or emposi. I'm human. I think. So far. Oh I don't know! I'm stuck in a book for God's sake!-" I stopped and stared at the sky. It turned grey. "No!" I yelled at it. "No! It slipped! Let me be!" It cleared as if scared. "Whoa. You know about the gods. You know about me. Wow. What else do you know, Leila?" "I know way more than you expect. You'll see what's coming," I said and walked off with a smirk on my face. I brought out the book and started reading. Later on, after I talked with Chiron for a bit, I was given a dorm. I went to it and opened it. Who did I find there? Oh. The one and only. Percy Jackson. "Can I like, not, run into you?" I asked and walked in. I sat down on my bed. I started reading. Grover sat up on his bed and studied me. I just kept reading. "Hey. What'cha reading?" Grover asked. The words changed in the book. Percy was wondering as well what I was reading. Grover appeared at my side and started reading my book over my shoulder. I yelled and the book snapped shut and shrinked. I face palmed myself. "Grover can I talk to outside?" I asked and he nodded. We walked outside and I pulled the book out. I held it in my palm and it grew. Grover's eyes got big. I smiled and opened it to now. I read aloud. " I wonder how this was supposed to end up. I just heard- I stopped. "Wrong page," I said and skipped two more pages. "Ah. Here: Leila and Grover just walked out of the room. What was she even doing here? She fainted and then disappeared and after all that happened, she appears again? I'm sorry, who the hell is she?!" Grover's mouth dropped. "That is all he's thinking this moment. I can't let anything big change in the books. But I need to make sure everything stays on track. I will be reading till the book ends. By then I should be free. Or I get sucked into another book. Trust me. You're lucky." " I'm lucky? I get food chucked at me!" "Yeah yeah. Like that happened to none of us." "Wait. It happened to you?" I nodded slowly. "Sorry," he mumbled. I smiled. "No need. I mean you get food chucked at you.
