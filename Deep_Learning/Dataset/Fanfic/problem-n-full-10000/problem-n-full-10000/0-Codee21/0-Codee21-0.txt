So, hi guys! I hope this answers some of your PMs - no, I haven't died, or fallen off the face of the Earth. It's just, well, college . I'm incredibly sorry it's taken me this long to post anything… and I'm sorry to say that I won't have time to finish the next chapter of Thorns Have Roses and The Thorn in My Side until Christmas…. but, well, I hope you'll forgive me just a little bit once you see what I've been working on. See, an amazing friend of mine decided to start up a student-run theater group on my campus, and we were fishing around for projects to do when he came up with the brilliant idea of writing and performing an original Harry Potter and the Cursed Child parody - because, let's face it, Cursed Child was simply begging for it, and it was only a matter of time. So he and I, along with four other friends, spent a few months writing this . The show, which I'm directing, will be performed at the end of the semester, and until then unfortunately it'll be taking up all my free time, as well as a good portion of time I should be spending doing homework. But it's a labor of love, and I hope you agree with me when I say it's well worth the effort. I'll be posting Acts I-IV separately, but since it's all written, I can guarantee they'll be updated just a few days apart. Again, I didn't write this alone, so I'd like to give a shout-out to my amazing co-writers who gave their time and energy to this project (and don't worry, I got permission from all of them before posting this here) Obviously, I don't own Harry Potter , or Cursed Child wouldn't exist and there would be nothing to parody I think that's all the icky technical authory things - so, enjoy!

The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road towards the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. ALBUS I won't ! I won't be in Slytherin! GINNY James, give it a rest. JAMES I only said he might be in Slytherin… (HARRY glares at him) …fine. ALBUS (To GINNY) You'll write me, won't you? GINNY As much as you'd like. We wrote to James three times a week last year. ALBUS (To JAMES) What? But you said- HARRY Don't believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts, Albus. He likes a laugh, your brother. LILY (Looking anxiously for someone in the crowd) Where are they? I don't see them! GINNY Don't worry Lily, we'll find them. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Finally, a group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. (Enter RON, HERMIONE, ROSE, and HUGO) LILY (Running up to RON) Uncle Ron! UNCLE RON! RON (Hugging her) Lily! If it isn't my favorite Potter! LILY Have you got my trick? (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL begins to flip through 'The Deathly Hallows' confusedly, searching for the dialogue that is taking place.) RON Are you aware of the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes nose-stealing breath? ROSE Mum! Dad's doing that weird thing again! (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL'S confusion intensifies) HERMIONE Rose, let him be, you know he likes to make jokes. RON (Leaning over LILY'S face) Hang on. Let me just munch this…air. And now it's just a simple matter of… (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL leans in to observe, ignoring the book in her hands. RON breathes on LILY and "removes" her nose) Excuse me if my breath smells of garlic… I've got your nose! LILY Oh Uncle Ron, you're so silly! PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL Well I never ! Ten points from J.K. Rowling! I refuse to watch this babbling, bumbling band of baboons a moment longer! Good luck keeping things true to canon without a narrator! HARRY Great, thanks Headmistress McGonagall! (To the rest of his family) It was so nice of her to wish us luck, you guys! I'm sure we'll nail this! I mean, I am Harry Potter after all. (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL snaps the book shut and exits in a huff) ALBUS Dad, everyone's staring at you again. Why do they always have to stare? HARRY Because I'm incredibly cool and famous, kiddo. But don't worry, you have my genes, so some of it is bound to have rubbed off on you. ALBUS But what if I'm Sorted into Slytherin? HARRY Albus Severus, you're my son, and you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts…no pressure! I'm sure you'll be awesome! ALBUS But Slytherin isn't awesome , Dad. HARRY Al, look. There's no way you'll be in Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes what you want into account, alright? So just play it cool, tell it you want to be in Gryffindor, and then you'll be amazing and popular like I am. (The train whistles from offstage. JAMES hugs GINNY and HARRY and runs off to board the train) You'd better get on! Have a great time, slugger. (ALBUS goes to hug his father but HARRY high-fives him and turns away. ROSE approaches him as GINNY, HERMIONE, RON, HUGO, and LILY wave goodbye. ALBUS and ROSE board the train. As they turn away, HUGO drops his hand and looks at GINNY.) HUGO They're fucked, aren't they Mum? HERMIONE Your sister will be okay, Hugo – she's just a side character. But Albus is Harry Potter's son and there's an unnecessary sequel centered around him. Of course he's fucked. (ALBUS and ROSE come across SCORPIUS on the train, who is sitting and reading by himself. He notices their presence and pops his head out of his book.) SCORPIUS Oh, hello there. Want some sweets? I've just been reading about how Honeydukes makes their Pepper Imps. It's fascinating really. (ALBUS starts to walk toward SCORPIUS, but ROSE stops him) ROSE Albus, what are you thinking ? Don't you know who that is? He's Scorpius Malfoy – people say he's Lord Voldemort's son. ALBUS Rose, don't be ridiculous. He has a nose. (He begins to walk toward Scorpius) ROSE But…but it's a small nose! (ALBUS ignores her – he only has eyes for SCORPIUS) ALBUS I'm Albus. The rest of my name isn't important because my dad sucks. (Reaching for the bag of sweets in Scorpius's lap, leaning over him) Mind if I try a taste? SCORPIUS I offered, didn't I? You have my whole-hearted consent. (ALBUS fumbles with the wrapper, still leaned over Scorpius's lap) ALBUS How – how do I…? SCORPIUS Haven't you ever done this before? ALBUS My parents just don't understand me. They don't exactly approve… (ROSE pulls ALBUS away from SCORPIUS, and we see he is holding a candy wrapper) ...of sweets. They've never let me eat sugary things, you see. ROSE Albus, we should go . I – I'm feeling ill. Dreadfully ill. (ALBUS shakes her off, still staring at Scorpius) ALBUS You know where the loo is, we passed it on the way here. (To SCORPIUS) But really, how do you open wrappers like these? SCORPIUS There's a spell, if it's really stuck. I could teach you. I could teach you a lot of things, really… ALBUS My wand is at the ready. ROSE Oh for Merlin's sake. Al, I'm leaving. (ALBUS sits down on the seat next to SCORPIUS, still not looking at ROSE.) ALBUS Yeah, okay, see you. (ROSE storms off) SCORPIUS Thanks for staying. ALBUS I stayed because you're sweet. No, wait, I meant to say I didn't stay because of you – I stayed because of your sweets. (People crowd around ALBUS, separating him from SCORPIUS before the latter can answer as the change to Great Hall occurs. SCORPIUS sits and reads his book, trying not to stare at ALBUS and failing. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL enters with the SORTING HAT.) SORTING HAT (Sing-song) Oh you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, For I'm a useful plot device That's why they're using me! There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, Except of course a Horcrux - And so-ci-o-path-y! Young Harry was a Slytherin Hermione, Ravenclaw And Ronald Weasley Hufflepuff That's how I'd sort them all! But Rowling thought it useful To unite them in one name So I threw them all in Gryffindor And secured their lasting fame Now once again I'm needed To separate friend from foe So put me on and talk with me And I'll tell you what I know! STUDENT #1 (Pointing to SCORPIUS) Come over here first, Sorting Hat! He's the son of Voldemort , he's got to be a Slytherin! (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL and the SORTING HAT go to SCORPIUS. The hat is placed on his head.) SORTING HAT Brainy. Innocent. No ambition of any kind. RAVENCLAW! (There is a collective gasp from the CROWD) STUDENT #2 (Hesitantly, they push ALBUS to the front) And – and him? He's a Potter! (PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL and the SORTING HAT go to ALBUS. The hat is placed on his head) ALBUS (Looking upward to speak to the hat) No one understands me, hat. I'm too angsty for that. But you're magical, aren't you? Maybe you can see I have daddy issues. Please put me in Gryffindor. SORTING HAT Sure, if it means that much to you! GRYFFINDOR! (The CROWD begins to cheer, but PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL shushes them. She speaks sternly to the hat.) PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL Now Hat, this is not what we discussed. This is a play. A LONG play. What do you expect, Albus will become a Gryffindor and everything will be unicorns and lemon drops? SORTING HAT Hufflepuff? PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL Warmer. SORTING HAT Ravenclaw? PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL There's only one option left... SORTING HAT Okay, fine, Slytherin! PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL Thank you, Hat. (She points to SCORPIUS) And what is young Mr. Malfoy over there? SORTING HAT (Sounding resigned) A Slytherin, Headmistress McGonagall. (Transition. ALBUS starts stage right with SCORPIUS by his side as the CROWD mills about. As the montage progresses they move steadily across to stage left.) STUDENT #3 What are you doing in Slytherin, Potter? STUDENT #4 Are you even Harry's son? STUDENT #5 You don't even look like him! (STUDENT #6 hands him a small vacuum cleaner) STUDENT #6 Come on, prove you're a Potter. Let's see you fly! ALBUS But you've given me a vacuum! STUDENT #6 The son of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley shouldn't need a broom to fly! You should be able to clean up the competition on the Quidditch pitch no matter what you're riding. SCORPIUS If Albus could fly without a broom he'd be proving he was Voldemort's son, not Harry Potter's. STUDENT #6 Whatever you say, Slytherin freaks! (STUDENT #6 fades back into the CROWD. ALBUS puts down the vacuum and moves forward with SCORPIUS.) STUDENT #7 Help! Troll! There's a troll in the dungeon! STUDENT #8 Let's get Potter to take care of it! (STUDENT #9 pushes out of the crowd) STUDENT #9
