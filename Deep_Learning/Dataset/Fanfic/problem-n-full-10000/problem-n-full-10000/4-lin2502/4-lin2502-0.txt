disclaimer I own only the story line everything else belongs to Stephenie Meyers CHAPTER 1 EPOV What the hell Emmett I was playing the piano when my coat came whizzing towards me "come on little bro we're going human and going for a walk in the park" "why" "because Alice have new boots and want to show them off I think, anyway it's boring here and the lake might be frozen over it might be fun" Jasper wandered in putting his coat on and we looked at each other "Alice" we both moaned together "yes my idea come on it'll be fun" we both groaned, we didn't need the coats but they would be humans out there some of our school pals I laughed when I thought of that they kept as far away from us as they could except the girls Emmett and Jasper were ok they had Rose and Alice to buffer the attention me the so called youngest of the Cullen pack when I was really older than them all except Carlisle and Jasper I was even older than my so called mother Esme I was 109 yrs old Carlisle was over 350 yrs. We didn't go out much around town but it was a dull cold day perfect for us really and I was still in the bad books with my so called brothers and sisters for stopping a van that nearly squished a fellow student I'd already had to miss school the week before because the scent coming off her was so good the best I've ever smelt I had to get away to gather my thoughts then the damn van skidded and nearly killed her I couldn't believe it, Bella was the chief's daughter she was oblivious to the fact she was so tempting. We all piled in Emmett's big Jeep it held the road better when it was icy Carlisle and Esme opted out of the trip. "I don't believe your making me do this" I moaned as we drove into town, "Edward you've been brooding over Bella for long enough time to get out for a bit of fresh air" "Alice I don't have to breath if I don't want to and it's not going to kill me I'm dead already" Rose and Emmett laughed "It'll be fun" she said again and shot a quick glance at me I looked in her eyes and saw what she'd seen and gasped then she shook her head very slightly so only I caught it. I read her thoughts again sometime time today Edward at the park they'll be 3 of them I think I know you've fallen for her so we've got to try and stop it, I nodded and sighed I'm going to be in more trouble now. BPOV Jessica phoned me "come on Swan we're all going to see if the lakes frozen" I winced ice and dancing two things I tried to stay away from "come on" shouted down the phone "we're all going they'll be about 8-10 of us you'll be safe from skidding vans" she laughed "ok ok I'll come but if I break something you'll be my slave till it's healed" I said getting my boots and coat out of the cupboard "good we'll pick you up in 5 mins" "where you going" my dad shouted from the kitchen he was making a sandwich he must have lived on sandwiches before I moved here "with Jess and the others to the park to see if the lakes frozen I'll be ok Jess or Mike will bring me back" They was a peep outside I turned the computer off I'd been doing research on something one of the boys from La Push had told me and didn't want Charlie my dad to see it. They was another peep " their waiting" my dad shouted upstairs I grabbed my hat scarf and gloves off the table next to the door and dashed outside They were 3 cars waiting a door opened and I climbed in Mikes car of course it was he grinned "hi Bella I'll keep you warm" like hell you will I thought he was a good mate but other than that I wasn't interested I was only interested in one and he was untouchable or so all the girls told me he had saved me from the van the other week so I had got close to him in a fashion apart from that he's totally ignored me ever since. Mike parked the car and we all piled out they was about 12 of us some I didn't know others I didn't want to know. After walking round the lake we found it wasn't solid enough to walk on and decided to go for a drink at the vendor instead, he had tables and benches there so we could sit and natter I'd notice we'd been followed by 2 scruffy looking men earlier but they seemed to have vanished by the time we'd sat and got a drink. I was looking round later I'd lost all interest in the chatter when I spotted them sat about 3 tables down and a woman had joined them they kept turning and watching us but I thought it might be because there was a lot of us safety in numbers right EPOV Emmett parked the car I recognized a couple of the cars there was Mike's and Ben's but not the other car Mike I growled at the thoughts I was going to have to put up with, then I remembered who's the other car was Jessica's this day had just got worse I put my nose in the air and sniffed I could tell that scent anywhere Bella I listened and could hear her heart beating Alice looked at me and I nodded in which direction to go, the others weren't in tune to her as I was plus they thought we were here for a stroll and to show off Alice's new boots. Her heart beat got louder the nearer we got to her I could hear all the other chattering and noises but after all these years I'd got good at shutting them out At the next corner I saw the vendor and Bella she was sat in the middle of about 12 of the kids from school her head was down and she looked fed up, Mike was sat on the bench as near to her as possible. As we got nearer I noticed the 3 sat at a bench about 3 tables down from Bella's I did a low growl which made Jasper turn to look at me I nodded towards the table. He glared at Alice "Alice is there something you want to tell the rest of us he said in a low voice" "I only see it I can't control it I only knew all 5 of us had to be here" "what are you two whispering about " Emmett said catching up with us Rose and Emmett had been acting about and lagged behind "oh look bro you're fan clubs here" I scowled at him and made eye contact then nodded toward's the 3 nomads "shit" he said when he realized what we were looking at "does this mean we might have some action" Rose rolled her eyes "Emmett fetch me and Alice a drinking chocolate please" she said he looked puzzled for a fraction of a second then went and stood at the vendors we sat two benches up from Bella's she hadn't seen us yet then I heard Mike " O good the Cullen's are here" he said Bella's head shot up and she saw Emmett at the vendors. I sat with my eyes closed listening they was the usual from Mike what the hell's he doing here and I was going to make a move today and the one that made me make eye contact with him and growl low "she's mine Cullen keep your hands off" he thought I stared at him then smirked "I don't think so Mike" he looked away. Jessica was just as bad what do I have to do to make him notice me, god he's gorgeous. Same old same old I thought, I got it from the female students and the female staff, the female staff I've turned it to my advantage more than once but I don't think Jessica would like the only way I am attracted to her if she knew me. Emmett came back with the drinks and put them on the table and went and stood at the back of Rose our way of letting one of our kind know it was our mate keep off. Jasper was at the back of Alice I looked up at Bella she was watching us or me I don't know which but when she saw me watching she sighed and looked away. I locked my eyes on the other table then closed my eyes and listened to the 3 nomads they were discussing the students it seems they wanted a meal before they moved on and one of them had decided on Bella. Alice was watching me very closely saw my eyes narrow and go black that only happens when our emotions are heightened and when we go into attack mode, Alice nudged Jasper and nodded to me and I felt calm again. "damn it Jaz" I snapped sitting up "keep calm bro we'll sort it out" We very rarely had arguments in our family Jaz always calmed thing down before they got started I looked at Alice "I'm sorry Edward it hasn't changed in about 18 months she'll be one of us" I shook my head "no never" I said, she sat and thought for a bit then got up and walked down to the 3 at the table they looked up. "hello" she chimed she had a sing song voice when she was being nice "would you like to join us" the woman stared at her "doesn't work on me sunshine I can block you and seeing you haven't answered my question I'll take it as a no" they looked at each other and she leaned down so only they could hear " they are my big brothers Edward and Emmett and that's Rose my sister now that is Jasper my mate as you can see he's got a few scars from training new born's a long time before you was born lets see how old are you" she looked them up and down "I'd sat 5-6 months old maybe 7 months no more, long way to go to match our leader and father figure Carlisle he's over 350 yrs and then there's our mother Esme they're at home" "home" one of them repeated "Yes we live here" she chirped "we have a few places all over the country and some out of the country so would you like to join us at our table" they all nodded and followed her, I got up so the woman could sit down we didn't have to sit but we looked more human that way I move to be between them and Bella's table and sat on the table with my feet on the bench watching and listened to them. One of them was still set on having Bella for dinner, Alice let me read her again and it was still turning out the same Bella would become one of us. BPOV Why did I come here today I don't like ice and cold I hate it I wonder if jess would take me home Mike shuffled next to me "Oh good the Cullen's are here" I looked up and saw Emmett at the vendor getting 2 drinks. My eyes followed him back to their table Edward was sat with his eyes shut and head down. Alice looked at me and smiled I smiled and looked away and sighed it was louder than
