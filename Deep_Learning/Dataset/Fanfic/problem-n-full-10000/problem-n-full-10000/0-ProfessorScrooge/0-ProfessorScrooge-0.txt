A/N: Okay, so I'm a Sherlock fan, and when reading some Sherlock/HP crossovers I stumbled across a work by Esama on Archive of our own named 'Business' that heavily intrigued me (which is well worth a read, and is probably better than anything I'm going to put out). So yeah, admittedly the basic idea and inspiration was theirs and I'm sort of stealing it and trying to work it into one story rather than a twelve thousand word one-shot, and giving it my own little twist and ideas. Beware, gender bending and majorly OOC characters ahead. Also, I will cite Wesley from Daredevil (Netflix series) as another inspiration, I really loved him as a charismatic, cultured villain, and I was sad when he died as I felt he made a better villain than the Kingpin himself. There is a lot to be said for the quiet malice of the elegant, cultured villain in an immaculate suit threatening you in a totally calm voice. (To be fair, I feel they did that whole thing wrong, and that they shouldn't have revealed Kingpin's face until the penultimate episode or so, and shouldn't have attempted to humanise him with the romance and tragic backstory. I like my villains to be villainous, but I digress.) 07/11/15: As of currently, there are four and a half chapters of this, and I've kinda run out of steam. I'll definitely be posting the first four, and maybe the unfinished or finished fifth at some point.

"What are you mumbling about?" came a high toned, cold voice from across the room. The girl looked up to see her 'aunt' standing by the doorway, her nose upturned as she spied the distinctly magical looking book the girl held. "Oh, just reading about how the wizarding world is full of racist, bigoted, oh, and sexist arseholes," she replied with an innocent smile that glinted with something else. The woman in front of her scowled at the mention of the Wizarding world, and then lightened slightly as it was described in such a way. "Yes, well, don't slouch, girl!" she commanded for lack of anything better to say. "Yes, Aunt Petunia," the black haired girl replied, looking back down at her book. "And the name , is Jasmine ," she added under her breath. Honestly, though her life at the Dursley's had improved greatly since she had discovered a book on laws in the library at school and black-mailed her extended family into treating her better and mainly leaving her alone, they still weren't exactly on cordial terms. That hadn't been helped when Jasmine had received a letter, to a school of magic of all things. The huge, bumbling gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid had come over a few days later to introduce her to the wizarding world, and thus far she was not that impressed. They were decades, perhaps even a century behind as far as technology was concerned, their system of governing was practically ancient, the blatant racism in their society was overwhelmingly clear, and their population was tiny. Added to all of that, it seemed like the majority of wizards were idiots. And Jasmine couldn't be happier, as it stood as a ripe and golden opportunity. The magical world was a consortium of opportunities, and on top of it all, she had the most important thing in the world; a great big pile of cash to exploit them with. When first she had looked upon her vault, her emerald green eyes had sparkled as she overlooked the piles of shining gold, silver and bronze. Now, it should be stressed, Jasmine was not a normal eleven year old. No, years of neglect and hatred for her 'family' had twisted her into quite a cold and opportunistic person who used her natural intelligence to achieve her goals. She, of course, knew this very well, and cared not one jot. ' The time has come, to move on, to many other things, the playground's done, its queen soon gone, and a world's new options bring ,' she thought to herself as she curled up on the sofa. ' The time to plan, the time to begin, to let the madness of revolution in .' Upon that thought, the girl stepped up off the sofa. ' No time like the present, after all. So much to do, so little time .' She quickly strolled out of the house, and stepped down the driveway of Number Four, Privet Drive. Palming her wand-a beautifully artful piece made of ebony, thirteen inches long and curved to a slightly rounded end, etched with silver in Celtic knots up its length, and with a thestral hair core. It was of course, her second wand, and purchased when she doubled back to Knockturn after leaving Hagrid at the Leaky Cauldron for a drink after the Gringotts ride, her first wand, and the one registered to her, was holly with a phoenix feather core, bought from Ollivander's. She paused at the pavement; looking around the street for any witnesses before flicking the ebony stick high up in the air. All of a sudden, there was a bang, and she resisted the urge to flinch as a tall, midnight purple bus flashed into existence. "Welcome to the Knight Bus," drawled a slack jawed youth leaning from the doorway, who yawned before continuing, "emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard, where would you like to go?" "Diagon Alley, please," she replied simply. "Three sickles, or for five you can go for our luxury-." "Here's three, plus a little extra to forget I was ever here," she interrupted, handing over eight silver coins. The man blinked, looking up at her, and then back down at the coins for a few moments before what she said finally reached his brain. "Right, please have a seat, Miss Smith," he said, putting three coins inside the pouch on his belt, while slipping the other five into his pocket. Jasmine nodded once, and moved to sit in the corner of the bus behind the stairs going up, where she was most shrouded in shadow. ################################################################################################### Jasmine smiled with satisfaction as she stepped out of Twilfitt and Tattings'. Those within had at first looked at her disapprovingly, what with her second hand muggle clothing, but their attitude had quickly changed at the first glitter of gold. Now of course, she cut quite the figure. Starting from her feet, she had simple, smart black shoes with an inch of heel, shined to a sheen, and her legs were clad in opaque, black tights. A simple, pencil skirt came down to just above her knees, in black of course. Her shirt was white however, but naturally the long tie and suit jacket were as midnight dark as her hair, although the latter was lined in a jade green on the inside. Finally, it was all overlaid in a long, black trench coat dipping to below her knees, and with silver buttons along the front, and under her wrists. With her long, matching dark hair, thin stance, pale face, high cheekbones and piercing eyes of emerald green, she cut quite the figure, despite her age and stature. Indeed, to any onlooker, she looked a few years older than her actual age. Looking around, she made a beeline for the entrance to Knockturn Alley, ignoring the shady persons clamouring around the area, and moving too quickly for them to get a good view of her and get any ideas. She paused only once, before the entrance to an enchanter's, to don an unadorned, plain white mask she had picked up nearby in muggle London at a fancy dress shop. The bell rang above the door as she stepped inside, idly perusing the glass cabinets in the dingy shop and the jewellery and such held within. "'Ere, what'chu want?" came the voice of the beefy man behind the counter, "you're a bit young to be in 'ere." "I'm here," she replied calmly, examining a black metal dagger, with a hilt made to look like wrapping ivy with Celtic Knots, "to get some items enchanted, and I suppose whatever else you might be able to interest me in." "I don't deal with kids," he said gruffly. "Ah, my dear Mr Wreath, gold is still gold, is it not?" she smiled under her mask as the man shifted, frowning a little. Ignoring his discomfort, she withdrew two separate cases from her pockets, and opened them side by side on the counter to reveal two pairs of reflective aviators, one with black lenses, the other dark green, and both with silver frames. "I need these enchanted, with glamours, notice-me-not charms, obscuration charms, voice alteration, night vision, forgetfulness charms, etcetera. The works. I do not want my face to be visible to any degree, and I want anyone looking at it to immediately forget any details. And of course, my voice to be obscured to that ofâ€¦.say a young adult aristocrat, maybe around eighteen to twenty." With exaggerated care, she withdrew a pouch from one of her many pockets which she opened to show the shimmer of gold within, "how much?" The shopkeeper licked his lips, obviously eyeing the gold hungrily, his thoughts as to her age long since out the window. "Hundred galleons," he said after a moment, and Jasmine gave a grin, knowing it was likely an extortionately high price. "Seventy," she said in return. "You kidding me? That kind of enchantment on those tiny things, ninety," he countered. "Alright then, you throw in that dagger over there, and you forget I was ever here, and we'll call it eighty. Otherwise, I walk out that door right now," her mask helped now as he scrutinised her visage, trying to determine how serious she was. She knew the deal was still likely massively overpriced, but much like earlier today, such expenses were worthwhile. In the short term anyway. "Deal," he eventually, grudgingly stated. ################################################################################################### As Jasmine stepped from the enchantment shop, she removed her mask and slipped on her black pair of aviators with no small sense of satisfaction once again. She had even, for an extra twenty galleons, been able to get a few extra items. Firstly, her buttons on the her coat and suit jacket were enchanted to make her appear taller, and with a slightly pronounced bust, making her appear older, and so with her face obscured, she now could pass for an-if small-adult. Secondly, she had acquired a silver necklace inset with a green gem, which enshrouded her face in shadows if at all possible, and obscured it in light if not, and changed her voice to that of a cultured, middle aged man. Ideas were already building in her head of exactly how she would be doing things, and all the pieces were falling into place. She even had a little idea of how she could add a bit of theatrics to things, but that would have to wait. For now, she made her way to the next stop on her list; the infamous Borgin and Burke's. Once again, on her entrance an old fashioned bell chimed, and once again she took to browsing the numerous mildly dark artefacts on display while allowing the store-owner-a grubby, weasel looking man-to gauge her for himself. "Ah, you have a good eye, madam," he said eventually as she was looking at a wizened, practically skeletal hand, "the Hand of Glory. Put a candle in it, and it gives light only to the holder. Best friend of plunderers and thieves." "An interesting item, for sure," Jasmine replied, picking it up as she walked over to the counter. Borgin frowned as he tried to concentrate on her face in an attempt to pick out the details. "However that would be a
