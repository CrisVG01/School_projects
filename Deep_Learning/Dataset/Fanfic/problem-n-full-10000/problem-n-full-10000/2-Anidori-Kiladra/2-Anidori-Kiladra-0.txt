Summary: AU. This series of letters detail the life of Sméagol after the events of Return of the King as he struggles with his multiple personalities (and his strange attraction to Frodo) and attempts to find happiness in Mount Doom by marrying an orc and opening a Bed and Breakfast. Disclaimer: All rights to Lord of the Rings go to J.R.R. Tolkien and New Line Cinema. And the Very Secret Diaries belong to the amazing Cassandra Claire. A/N: These letters were written in 2002-2003 by Eileen, Tenley, Sophie, Allie and me, mostly Eileen and me. Yeah, we had way too much time on our hands. You probably have to read Cassandra Claire's Very Secret Diaries first in order for them to make sense. And while you're at it, you should read all her other stuff too, because she is absolutely phenomenal. There are some Spanish phrases in this story. Their meaning should be pretty obvious within the context, but just for those dim among you: casa: house mi papa: my dad sueter: sweater bailar: to dance me gusta: it pleases me, I like para comer: to eat pregunta: question fuego: fire magico: magic Letters to Granny Dear Granny, We is very sorry that we hasn't written to you in over 250 years. You see, first we was mad at you for turning us out, then we spent 200 years squatting in darkness, jewelry fondling and talking about oursself in 3rd person/1st person plural. Then we was too sad to write because the nassssssssty Bagginses stole our precious. Then we spent 50 or so years being forced to watch Flipper and old reruns of something in Sauron's fortress (stupid Sauron), then we was busy escaping from elves and tracking down tricksy little hobbitses who now have our precious. Guess what, Granny? Good Sméagol is now good(ish) again and is helping the nice master destroy the precious. NO, NO, PRECIOUS, WE MUST POKE THEIR LITTLE EYESES OUT BECAUSE THE SUSPISIOUS HOBBIT IS ALWAYS WATCHING! THEN WE THROTTLES THEM IN THEIR SLEEP! YES, PRECIOUS. But we likes the master; he takes care of us. NO, A BAGGINS STOLE IT AND A BAGGINS HAS IT NOW. WE HATES THE BAGGINSES! Not this Baggins. YES, ALL BAGGINSES. Oh yummy, we has tracked the tricksy little hobbitses into Gondor and is now eating fish so juicy sweeeeeeeeeet! Nice fisssh, nice fissssh. Oh no, now master wants good Sméagol to leave. Told him we must finish fish, but he said precious would get angry and as we sweared on...on the precious! We must go. We will write to you again from our new casa after we has bitten off nice masters finger (with which he strokes the precious lovingly), and while dancing around going "my precious, my precious, we finally has our precious" has fallen into mount doom, still yelling "my preeeeeeciouussss". Love, Sméagol/Gollum/us! P.S. Say hello to Deagol for us. (Oh wait, we had to kill him precious; he sssssstole our birthday present from us! Not listening.) P.P.S. It has suddenly occurred to us that you probably died hundreds of years ago, unless of course you found another precious, in which case we will have to kill you. Unless you visit us in Mt. of Fuego and give it to us for our 278th birthday pressie. xxx Hello Sméagol, Thissssss issssssssss your granny. How dare you say that we is dead. Of course we has a precious. (But don't tell Sauron or else he might set up a booby trap for us. Stupid Sauron). And hhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh haaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. You can't come and steal the precious from us because you are all burned up. Fortunately no nasssssssty hobbitses have tried to get the precious from us yet. Thank you for warning us. Good Sméagol. I have said hello to Deagol's rotting corpse for you. He says " ", because he's dead. You killed him; we knows. We knows you had to kill him, precious, he sssssstole your birthday present from you. Well, we has news for you, good Sméagol. Deagol covertly slipped the real precious to us before he died. (We is magico). And the one you had and were tracking los tricksy little hobbitses down for was a DECOY! So ha ha ha on you again. Poor Sméagol, we will come visit you in your new casa soon, but we will come without the precious so you can't steal it from us. We will bring you fresh fish however. Yay! Love from your, Granny P.S. It has suddenly occurred to us that you is probably melted by now. Perhaps we won't visit you in your new casa after all. xxx Dear Granny, Guess what? We got some nice fissh. Except mi papa says that they're not for eating and they're just supposed to swim around in the tank. I said "What about their legs? They don't need them." He pointed out that fish don't have legs. Stupid papa. I think I will sneak into the Forbidden Fishtank tonight and eat them anyway. Nice fissh, precious. Don't want fish. -Sméagol P.S. We took one of those stupid internet questionnaires. Even though the internet doesn't exist yet. Here is the results: Sméagol's Questionnaire 1. Do you love anyone? THE PRECIOUS AND FISH 2.How much? VERY MUCH 3.Who is the hottest person ever?

WE IS NOT EVEN DIGNIFYING THAT WITH AN ANSWER 10.What is your secret desire? WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID OR SOMETHING? HAVEN'T YOU READ THE BOOKS? TO TRACK DOWN LOS TRICKSY LITTLE HOBBITSES AND GET BACK THE PRECIOUS! No, no, Sméagol. I knew about that; that is not secret. What is your secret desire? DON'T TELL ANYONE, BUT WE ONLY WISHES TO CATCH SOME FISHES. No, Sméagol, I don't think you know the meaning of the word "secret". For the last time, what is your secret desire? DARN IT, WE WAS HOPING WE WOULD GET AWAY WITH THE FISHES ONE. OKAY, OKAY, WE WISHES TO TAKE NICE MASTER OUT TO DINNER AND FOR PEOPLE TO STOP CALLING POOR SMEAGOL A "SNEAK". Bye, xxx Dear Granny, Hello, how is you doing? We is glad to hear you isn't dead. NO WE ISN'T! WE HATES GRANNY! No, we looooves Granny. She makes us nice cookies. Nice peanut butter cookies. YOU IDIOT! WE'S ALLERGIC TO PEANUT BUTTER! Oh. Well, how is the weather at your house? Is very hot in Mount Doom. Pretty fire, though. And Lord Sméagol, no, Gollum the Great, the Gollum has fish three times a day, fresh from the fish tank. YOU IDIOT! WE'S ALLERGIC TO SEAFOOD! Oh. That would explain the coughing and hacking after the Forbidden Pool scene. WE HATES THE MASTER! Nope. We loves nice master. Takes cruel rope off Sméagol. Anyway, Granny, we is thinking of starting a Bed and Breakfast here. Really good location for vacationing hobbitses, yes Precious. And they won't make us grub for roots and carrotses and- what's taters? YOU IDIOT! WE'S ALLERGIC TO TATERS! Well, goodbye, Granny. Love, NO! HATE! No, we loves Granny, HATE, GOLLUM xxx Dear Sméagol, I'm glad to see that you still have split personality disorder. Sméagol is supposed to be doing his honors essays, so bye. I'll write to you again tomorrow and send you some yummy peanut-butter-tater-whatever-elsse-you're-allergic-to cookies, because we hatessssssss the good Sméagol. Love, Granny xxx Hello Granny! Is still hot in Mount Doom, so will most unfortunately not be able to make use of sweater you sent (pink not our color anyway). WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT! WE LOVES PINK! WHERE WOULD YOU BE WITHOUT PINK? Well we's allergic to wool anyway. Have just opened Bed and Breakfast. Is called Sméagol's B&B. NO! GOLLUM'S B&B! No, Sméagol's B&B. Leave now and never come back! We told him to go away, and away he went! Sméagol is FREE! Anyway, B&B not going too well. Was expecting a curly-haired, blue-eyed Hobbit who enjoys jewelry fondling, squatting in darkness and referring to self in third person to show up. Most unfortunately, no Hobbits are coming at all. What is poor Sméagol going to eat? We's allergic to everything else. (YOU'S ALLERGIC TO HOBBITS TOO!) And orcs don't taste so good. Your "friend" Free Sméagol xxx Hello, my darling Sméagol. NO WE HATES SMEAGOL! We has a suggestion to make. How about you call your B&B Fresh Fish From The Ocean (or the fish tank) and you could serve fresh fish from the ocean (or the fish tank). Except that there is probably no fish tanks or oceans in Mount Doom. We is so sorry you doesn't like the sweater we sent. (NO WE ISNT, WE KNEW YOU WAS ALLERGIC TO WOOL; THAT'S WHY WE SENT IT.) But we didn't send you a pink sueter; we sent you a purple one, and then shipped it to Rivendell's Quick Mail to Mount Doom Service. I was told it got sent directly to Elrond himself. I wonder what happened to it. Elrond wouldn't do anything to it. He is nice like fisssssh. (NO, WE HATES ELROND. HE TWISTS EVIL ROPES.) Well, we must be going now. Love, Granny xxx Dear Granny, How are you? Sméagol is doing very bad. Why do you cry Sméagol? (Sniff) Master tricked us. He sold film rights to Lord of the Rings. WE TOLD YOU HE WAS TRICKSY! No! YES! Stupid, cruel men copied poor Sméagol's Forbidden Pool song. LET'S GO POKE THEIR LITTLE EYESES OUT! Or... We could let HER do it. WHO'S HER, EH, PRECIOUS? Our lawyer! She sues the cruel men for copying our Forbidden Pool song! YAY! Your friends, Sméagol/Gollum who is going to POKE THEIR LITTLE EYESES OUT/sue New Line Cinemas for copyright infringement. xxx Dear Granny, Hmmm... This is very mysterious. I also tried to send you something purple through Rivendell. Perhaps Elrond stole it too. NO! IT'S BECAUSE GRANNY DOESN'T LIKE THE PURPLE LOINCLOTH THAT YOU SENT HER! YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS. NOBODY LIKES YOU! No. We knows Granny would ask Sméagol for a receipt so she could exchange it for a nice pink loincloth instead. She wouldn't trick poor Sméagol and pretend she never got it. YES SHE WOULD! SHE IS TRICKSY! No. Elrond stole it! NO HE DIDN'T! PURPLE DOESN'T MATCH HIS SKIN COMPLEXION! HATE, GOLLUM P.S. Thank you for your B&B idea. It has helped us settle the dispute. We was going to have a boxing match to see what it would be called. P.P.S. We thinks that having multiple personalities must run in the family. xxx Hi Sméagol, How is you doing now? This is very mysterious indeed(y). We has received a lime green loincloth from you, but you says you sent a purple one? Hmmmmmmmm, well, we would have loved to have a purple one. NO WE WOULDN'T, WE HATES PURPLE. IT DOESN'T GO WITH OUR COMPLEXION OR ANY OF OUR PURSE AND SHOE COMBOS! Unfortunately neither does lime green. Oh, we tells a lie; there was that one lime green high heel and bag set we got from Deagol BEFORE YOU DID HIM IN (we is not allowed to write the word "kill" in our e-mails anymore because we has a tattle-tale little sister). Anyway, we is going to have to test Elrond. We must send him a purple chain mail thingy for you to bailar around in (well, we will send it to you through Rivendell Quick Service) and see what color you get. That should solve the mystery. NO, WE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ELROND AND SMEAGOL. WE HAS BETTER THINGS TO
