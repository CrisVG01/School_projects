Author's Note: Okay, so here I was thinking that Teardrops & Teacups was finished. As I was planning out Empire, I realized how big of an impact T&T would have on that plotline later one. Looking back at T&T I realized just how many errors there were and that it needed to be edited/revised. Well, that totally inspired a discussion between starrnobella and me. Turns out, there's more to this story than meets the eye! So, here we are. This is the first chapter of one of TWO companion pieces to T&T. This story will probably be darker than T&T ever was; in fact, I know it is. PLEASE check the trigger warnings. Also, to my readers of T&T (and the other parts of the WwT series) welcome back! I hope you enjoy this story. To my new readers, welcome to the ride! There will be four chapters that coincide with the chapters (years) of T&T and I will post a chapter as I edit T&T and write this. The second companion piece is going to take me a while longer and will be started after the completion of this four part tale. I want to thank starrnobella for inspiring this story and beta reading like a rock star! She is also the amazing person who wrote the articles and addendums for this story! You're fantastic and I love you more than words! I want to thank Squarepeg72 for alpha reading and sending me copious amounts of pretty things like quote aesthetics and songs to hit me in the feels. I must also thank SaintDionysus for creating an epic T&T playlist for me and sharing T&T on tumblr. I love that you call Teardrops & Teacups Hermione's Eat. Pray. Love. story… It really is, and I think this new piece will show everyone just how much it really is! Enough rambling…onto the story! Please leave lovely feedback when you're done! xxDustNight Disclaimer: All non-original characters, plot points, and information belongs to J.K. Rowling.

Travel Logs & Unsent Letters Part One: 2006 24 December 2005: Unsent letter to Draco Malfoy Draco, I'm not certain how to get across exactly the way I'm feeling right now. I want you to know that I wish you all the happiness in the world. I always have, and I always will; but a part of me aches for that happiness to be with me. It wasn't supposed to be this way, you know? Our fairy tale was only just beginning, and now… Now it's a broken mess. I guess I'm writing you to say… I love you. Please, don't go through with this marriage. There has to be some way, some loophole we missed in the betrothal contact. We were supposed to be forever, that's what you said. We had plans, wishes, dreams of forever. Don't...don't let me go, Draco. I can't go through this life without you. Love, Hermione . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 January 2006: Travel Log #1 Sydney, Australia Traveling again… This time without searching for Horcruxes or the threat of Voldemort down my back. Only, I don't feel any less scared. This time it's a different type of frightened. I'm so terrified of what the future holds, especially since I thought I had it all figured out. Brilliant job at the Ministry and a handsome man on my arm. Who would have guessed eight years after the bloody war and Pureblood idiocy would still manage to make my life a living nightmare? I've arrived in Sydney to stay with my parents for a while. I think it will do me some good to be away from London and all the papers flashing news about the wedding of the decade. It should have been different, a different story, a different bride… I'm going to try to keep from thinking about it. This is a new year, and I hope it brings new beginnings, or at least gives me reason to move forward from this heartache. Either way, I know I'll be okay in the end. I've survived worse things than a broken heart. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 January 2006: Travel Log #2 Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia It's early. So early the sun has barely risen and already there are a smattering of people on the beach. Mostly, they're running, or walking, or just taking in the sunrise. A few of the restaurants are open for breakfast, allowing the early morning stragglers to get a small bite to eat or a fresh cup of coffee. I'm more of a tea person. I found a lovely little teacup at a random shop this morning. It has the Australian flag painted delicately on its surface. I don't know what made me buy it; it's not like I can use it to drink tea. Maybe, when I finally return home, I'll place it on my mantle to remember this vacation. Alas, the day is young and my mum will be wondering where I am. I suppose it's time to return to the house. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 January 2006: Unsent Letter to Draco Malfoy France is one of my favorite places to visit. Did you know that when you decided to take her there for your honeymoon, or was it her idea? I can picture the two of you strolling through the Louvre, hand in hand as you gaze at art as beautiful as you. Did you kiss her at the top of the Eiffel Tower? Did you make love to her in your special suite, hoping to conceive a child while the city of lights illuminated your bodies through the window? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 January 2006: Travel Log #9 Sydney, Australia Deciding to stay in Australia has been a wonderful idea. Maybe I'll never return to dark, old London. I can visit the beach with my mum and go to the flea market with dad. I can almost forget the pain and heartache that I left behind. I think I can do some good work for the Wizarding world as a whole if I can just get my head together. As I sit in my bedroom, I imagine a world that's not governed by societal norms created by Purebloods of the past. If I never return, I can easily forget. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31 January 2006: Unsent letter to Ron Weasley There are days when I remember what it felt like to hold your child within me. I remember the joy, the nervousness, the hope. Then, I quickly remember what it felt like to have that all fall to pieces in the blink of an eye. How can you look at me, even now, after all the time that has passed, and know that my body failed you-us!? I'm sorry, Ron. I wish I'd been stronger...that the effects from the Cruciatus hadn't cursed me this way. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 February 2006: Unsent letter to Draco Malfoy I've started something, Draco.

It was beautiful! We saw Kiki and Herb and it was exactly what I needed to break through this fog I've found myself drowning in. It's hard to believe how much can change in a year but change it has. I'm not quite sure how to feel at the moment so I am going to join my parents for one last cuppa before heading to bed. At least I'm not alone. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 February 2006: Unsent letter to Kingsley Shacklebolt Minister, I am resigning as Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Department.
