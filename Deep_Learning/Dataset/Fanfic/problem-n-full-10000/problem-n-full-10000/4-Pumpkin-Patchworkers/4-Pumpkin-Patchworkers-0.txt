A few of us got together and decided to write you something totally epic for your birthday... We hope you enjoy! The author of each chapter is listed next to the chapter number! Hope your birthday is as fabulous as you! Chapter 1 – shell "What the hell did high fructose corn syrup ever do to anyone?" Edward mumbled as he studied the display of fruit snacks in front of him. He was pretty sure it didn't really matter. Corn was a vegetable; it couldn't be that bad for you. Peering over into the cart at the wide-eyed one-year-old little person staring back at him, Edward stuck his tongue out at her and grabbed the box promising the fruit snacks within were made of one hundred percent fruit juice and absolutely no high fructose corn syrup. "Don't get mad at me when they aren't shaped like little princesses." Chapter 2 – shell Edward threw the box in the cart and leaned down to kiss the tip of his niece's nose. "You wouldn't get mad at your Uncle Edward, would you, baby girl? I promise the next time your daddy leaves you with me, I'm stuffing you full of princess-shaped high fructose corn syrup." "Dude," Emmett's voice boomed behind him, "it's no wonder you're single. Stop talking to yourself in the middle of the grocery store." "Fuu-dge you, Emmett. I'm talking to Nessie. Besides, it's her first sleepover with me. I want her to be excited." "You do know she gets excited over fart noises, right?" Chapter 3 - shell "You're just jealous she looks more like me than you." Edward tucked one of Nessie's wild strands of red hair behind her ear, only to watch it pop back out again. "Good thing, too, isn't it?" he whispered conspiratorially to her. "Fuck you," Emmett replied with absolutely zero heat in his voice. "Finish picking out her food while I go grab some extra diapers. Rose is going to kill me if we're late." Emmett was a nervous wreck at the thought of leaving Nessie overnight and had shown up early to take Edward to the store. It would've been endearing if it weren't so damn annoying. Chapter 4 - shell Edward rounded the corner and started up the cracker aisle, determined to put the same amount of effort into selecting the best cheese cracker for Nessie as he had for the fruit snacks. He crouched down to study the Goldfish, wondering why he was even looking at the rainbow-colored ones when he knew the ones made with whole wheat would end up in his basket, when Nessie finally decided she'd had enough of sitting in the cart. In a matter of seconds, she went from being a quiet, cute-as-a-button baby to a screaming, red-in-the-face toddler throwing a temper tantrum. Chapter 5 - shell "No! No, no, no," Edward mumbled, fumbling with the buckle holding her in the seat. "We agreed we were going to have a good day, so your daddy would let you come back. Please do not throw a fit here!" Nessie was having none of it, though. Her tiny fists landed in Edward's hair, pulling hard, and she tried to her best to bat his hands away as he struggled to unclasp her belt. "I'm trying to help you!" he all but shouted at her, wishing he could sink into the ground to get away from the judgmental glares of other shoppers. Chapter 6 - shell He finally unhooked her strap and immediately tried to pick her up, but her shoe was stuck in the stupid leg hole, increasing her wails tenfold as Edward tugged at her chubby leg. "Please, baby girl. Please stop crying! I'm doing my best. I promise!" Edward pleaded. "Can I help?" The voice behind Edward startled him so much he jumped, making his niece cry even more, but when the stranger quickly freed Nessie's foot so Edward could hold her properly, he would've sworn she was an angel sent straight from Heaven. And that was before he even got his first look at her. Chapter 7 - IA "Can I help?" Bella heard herself ask. She internally rolled her eyes at herself. Here she was, grocery shopping—something she hated—on the worst day of her week, and she couldn't mind her own business and finish her shopping quickly. No, she just had to play the Good Samaritan. She had never been able to help herself. When she heard a baby cry, she had to check that everything was all right. She had been on the receiving end of many a dark glare from annoyed parents in the past, but this time, the poor guy looked so grateful. "Please say you're free tonight." Chapter 8 – Chayasara Bella looked up at the face attached to the panicked voice and tried to hide her surprise. He looked awfully young to be a father and awfully inept to be a parent. That didn't stop her, however, from appraising his appearance. Whoa! Bella was sure that her open mouth and wide eyes weren't her most attractive look. "I'm not free," she responded, "but I am reasonable." She looked down, embarrassed by her feeble attempt at humor. Hesitating, she glanced back up at him, relieved to see him smiling back at her. Chapter 9 - KarenEC "Reasonable, huh?" The guy raised his voice slightly to be heard over his baby's babbling. "Well, call me jealous—I'm just going for sane right now!" "Sounds like you had a rough day." Bella smiled sympathetically at him before grinning widely at the child in his arms. The little girl let out a peal of laughter, grabbing at Bella with one chubby fist. Bella chuckled. "Now why would a pretty girl like you give your daddy a hard time?" She aimed a broad wink in the father's direction. "Daddy? Oh!" the guy almost squeaked, his eyes growing wide with surprise. Chapter 10 - Jayme "Oh, no. No, you have the wrong idea!" Edward choked while trying to keep his voice from climbing any higher. Did he look like a responsible parent, he wondered, or could she tell that he was in completely over his head? Suddenly, terror struck him. ROSALIE. If she ever found out that he asked a stranger, albeit a beautiful one, to help him with Nessie, she'd have his balls on a platter, and he'd never get another chance at an overnight visit. He pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to wipe out the horrifying image of being brutally attacked. Chapter 11 - Mina Rivera The little girl was still whimpering; the man looked frozen in fear, and Bella was confused. "You're not her daddy?" "No, I am." Bella turned around to find a mountain of a man standing right behind her. She almost felt intimidated, but the gentleness and mischief on the man's face appeased her. "Edward, what the hell are you doing to my poor princess?" Edward finally snapped out of his thoughts and released his niece from the straps, handing her over to Emmett. Surprisingly, the little girl quieted down and snuggled into the crook of her father's neck, clearly very content. Chapter 12 - Mina Rivera Bella watched the scene, and she suddenly realized what was happening, and her embarrassment stained her cheeks red. "Oh my goodness! I'm so sorry. I didn't know!" "Didn't know what?" asked Edward, confused by the woman's sudden outburst. Bella palmed her forehead. "I should have known! I'm so sorry. I can clearly see you two are together. You three make a wonderful family." Emmett and Edward looked at each other, horror written all over their faces, and then turned back to Bella. "HELL, NO!" they both yelled at the same time, scaring the baby and making her cry all over again. Chapter 13 - Yummy "Shh, shh, shh." Emmett softly attempted to calm the baby, stepping away from his half-bewildered, half-disgusted brother and the adorably confused young lady standing with them. Bella, beyond mortified, crouched down and started digging through her bag. "I really had no idea," she muttered, still rifling. "I might have a biter cookie she can nibble and suck on if she's teething." Edward tried diligently not to think about this gorgeous girl and her generous offer of things to nibble and suck on. It would hardly be appropriate for him to reciprocate the invitation at this early stage of their relationship. Chapter 14 - Yummy "Aha!" Bella triumphantly produced a small baggie of banana-shaped cookies just as Emmett approached. "And what did you mean by, 'Hell, no!' Edward?" Emmett snapped while buckling Nessie back into her colorful cart protector. "I'm the shit! You'd be lucky to land somebody like me, you know!" Edward's green eyes bugged out of his head, listening to his brother's lunatic ramblings. "Are you high, Em? We're trying to dial down the crazy here, you idiot!" Bella's eyes ping-ponged back and forth between the brothers, trying to figure out if a camera crew would jump out announcing she was being Punk'd . Chapter 15 - Sandy She only had a few things when she got to the checkout line. She felt like such an idiot. First, she offered to help a stranger with his child, then found out the child wasn't his and assumed he was in a relationship with that giant guy. Walking out to the car, pushing her measly few groceries, she spotted them again. How could she have thought the two of them were together? "Excuse me . . . " As Bella turned around, she saw the sexy one running towards her, holding her scarf. She must have dropped it. At least she didn't fall down. Chapter 16 - Sandy His kisses were so soft and warm, kissing her, tasting her. The feeling of his fingers pinching her nipples made a thrill of desire go through her core. She wanted his shirt off. She wanted to feel his chest. She could not get close enough. Her breathing increased a little as he hitched one of her legs over his hip. She could feel the bulge she knew was there. Grinding down a little . . . **ping pong trilllll** **ping pong trillll** As her cell phone rang, Bella snapped out of her fantasy, rolling her eyes at who was interrupting her. "Hey, Mom . . . " Chapter 17 – Marlea Pie "Hey, Mom," Bella answered as she unloaded her groceries into her trunk. "Bella, baby? Riley is running around in nothing but his birthday suit and a Superman cape! I just cannot keep up!" Bella let a laugh escape, and Edward tightened his hold on her scarf, thinking he wanted to know more about his beautiful grocery store savior. Bella sighed as she loosened her hair from the makeshift bun. The sound of a sharp breath alerted her to spin around, and she tsk'd herself for stupidly forgetting that the sexy stranger was standing by her car. "Be there soon. Tell him I love him." Edward's heart deflated in his chest at hearing those words. Of course she had someone waiting at home for her. Chapter 18 – Marlea Pie Bella stuffed her phone into her large leather tote and leaned against her car, appraising the sight before her. He looked so sad. She didn't like it. "Hey, sex—stranger." Bella could feel the blood rush to her face at her slip of the tongue. "Thanks for this." She motioned to her scarf as he handed it over. "My pleasure." Edward grinned, his hands finding the bottom of his pockets. He rocked on his heels as they stared at each other, smiling goofily. "So, I know I asked if you were free tonight . . . " Chapter 19 - Heather (dream) "Unfortunately, I think my sister-in-law would have my head if I had a stranger over while watching my
