Hi! This is a prequel to "The Day You Came Back" told in Jasper's point of view. This is also a one shot. Enjoy :) The Year Before I Left I sensed Edward's stare on me once again. From the corner of my eyes, I peeked and saw him sneaking glances my way, his eyes lingering too long to be innocent. It was as if he was savoring the sight, appreciating every inch of my body. Edward often looked at me. It was always secretive. His eyes would cautiously gaze from under his long lashes and they would travel down my face, to my mouth, my neck and lower to my chest. He would look at my hands with fascination. He didn't think I ever noticed it. But it was impossible not to. My whole body knew when his eyes were on me. I felt alive under his gaze. My heartbeats were stronger and my skin sizzled. His eyes warmed me until my whole being burned. I liked his eyes on me. I forced my eyes off of him and looked around at our group of friends. We were all sitting at one of the picnic tables in the schoolyard. None of them noticed the way Edward gawked at me. Alice leaned against me. Instinctively, I wrapped my arms around her petite frame. I barely noticed how the warm feelings inside of me disappeared and the usual numbness took over. I looked back at Edward but he was gone. I wanted to let go of Alice but she twisted in my embrace and smiled sweetly at me. "Hey babe, what are you doing after school?" she purred. I shrugged, feeling up to nothing suddenly. "Why don't you come over to my place later, we could watch a movie or something," she suggested, her eyebrows lifting up seductively. I considered her offer briefly. We both knew I would say yes. Alice and I were friends with benefits. Everybody told me that I would break her heart in the end because she really liked me. But she knew I wasn't looking for anything serious. "Sure." I answered mechanically just as the school bell rang. I was relieved lunch was over. I swiftly swung my bag over my shoulder and bent down to kiss her forehead. "See ya later, darling." As I walked to class, I told myself Alice would help me feel better. I needed a warm body to touch me. I needed to feel that crazy heartbeat in my ribcage, the blood pumping through my veins and the sweat pouring out of my pores. I needed to feel alive and desired. And Alice could provide this for me. I ignored the twinge of guilt deep inside. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** "I made cookies for you and your friends," Edward's mom said as she walked into the living room with a tray of treats. Tyler, Bree, Edward and I had been assigned to do a group project for English together and we were gathered in Edward's living room with books and construction papers all around us. "Thanks mom," Edward answered as he quickly got up to help his mom and took the tray from her. He was always so considerate. "Thank you, Esme," I said as I grabbed a cookie a little too eagerly before Edward's had time to set the tray on the coffee table. My fingers brushed Edward's and something alike an electric shock burnt me. I retracted my hand too fast and my wrist pressed a little too hard on the tray by accident. The tray started swaying, and Edward seemed to lose hold of it so I quickly grabbed the tray as well, helping to stabilize it before placing it on the coffee table. "Yay, you saved the cookies," Bree grinned at me, her sparkling brown eyes staying on me too long. I returned her smile with difficulty. I was stunned by that weird sensation that had traveled through me when my fingers had touched his. Edward chuckled but it sounded a little nervous. His voice was near and I could feel his breath on my cheek. I shivered a little. I looked at his flushed cheeks and the way he was fidgeting. I wondered if he had felt it too. "Well, Esme's cookies are too damn good to go to waste," I joked uneasily, moving away from Edward. "They are good!" Tyler mumbled with a mouth full of cookies. We all laughed. I felt his eyes on me then, and I glanced his way. His face was still flushed and he had a small, timid smile. When my eyes locked with his, his green orbs flickered and something clenched inside my chest. I tore my gaze away and stared at a book feeling all kind of weird. "So, how should we start this project?" I asked the group. I didn't look back at him once during that afternoon, even when I was aware of his eyes on me. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** "Jazzy," my sister called me from her room. "Em just texted me that him and Eddie wanna go to the beach. What do you say?" There was a tiny stab in my chest. I was often jealous of Emmett and Edward's friendship. I always wondered why Edward and I never got to become closer friends. There was always a wall around him when it came to me, and it made me mad. Rosie made her way to my room, a huge smile on her face. "So? Wanna go?" "Yeah I guess so." I shrugged. Rosie squealed and clapped her hands, running back to her room. My sister had become extremely girly since she had started dating my best friend Em last year. "They'll come and pick us up in an hour!" She yelled back from the bathroom. When Em and Edward arrived, Rosie and I joined them. Edward, the forever gallant gentleman, jumped out of the car. "Hey Rosie, sit up front with Em," he offered to my sister with a perfect smile as he held the door for her. I took my seat in the back, an incomprehensible feeling of unease nestling in my chest. "Yo, dude!" Emmett greeted me and turned half way. "I heard Lauren will be down at La Push with her friends." He whispered, wiggling his eyebrows. Edward slid next to me and slammed the door without uttering a word. Em and I glanced his way, surprised by the negative vibes coming from him. "Eddie, is everything cool?" Em asked, concerned. Edward nodded and attempted to give us a half-smile before turning his head to stare out the window. Em and I exchanged a questioning look before Em turned around and started driving. I glanced over to Edward. He stood all the way on the other side of the car, his jaw clenched, his arms crossed over his chest, while he started outside. There was this familiar distance between the two of us, and for some reason, it was pissing me off. "We still have to make one stop," Rosie mentioned, a wicked smile on her face. "Ali and Bella are coming with us." Emmett laughed and accused her of playing matchmaker. "Fuckin' perfect," Edward mumbled, too low for the other two to hear. I felt my chest tighten uncomfortably. Alice had a huge grin and waved when we parked. Bella had a shy smile on her face and gazed at Edward. I slid to the middle to allow the girls to settle in. Alice jumped in first and sat close to me, giving me the googley eyes. When she grabbed my hand, I scooted further away on a pretext to give Bella and her more space. The tiny tingles that spread through my side as my leg brushed against his thigh took me by surprise. I simultaneously wanted to pull away and press it harder against his. My body yearned to feel more. As the girls settled in, they were chatting excitedly with Rosie but their voices seemed far away, muffled by the weird, sizzling sensations that my contact with Edward created. Ali slid all the way until her side was flushed against mine. I noticed that her warmth wasn't as intense or as blissful as his. She leaned really close to me. "Maybe I should sit on your lap," she giggled. "I don't think we can fit four of us in the back." I moved even more to the left, towards the attractive warmth, until my side and his were glued together. "I think we can manage to all fit," I replied to her with a strained smile. I ignored the shaky inhale he took, and the goose bumps that erupted on my skin as his exhale showered around me. I felt ashamed of the stir down below and took deep inhales to control myself. I didn't turn to look at him once during the twenty minutes ride. But I was so alert to his flesh against mine, to my heart pounding harder than usual, to my own shaky breath. I was way too aware of his nearness. I tried to keep my focus on the others to avoid my body from betraying me. I forced myself to joke and laugh, and I was loud on purpose to hide the burning feeling creeping under my flesh. Once at the beach, I easily escaped, making my way to Lauren's crew to put on the charm. I needed a distraction real bad. The girls were giggling and I continued to flirt shamelessly. I peeked towards my friends and Rosie glared at me while consoling Alice. I sheepishly looked away, towards the sea, and noticed Edward swimming. He was far but I could still make out his silhouette. I could see his muscles rippling with each stroke and the water glittering on his bare flesh. Something deep inside of me twisted and I felt a rush of heat spread through me. I swiftly looked back at Lauren. "Wanna go somewhere more private?" I whispered in her ear. She grinned and followed me. I leaned against a tree and looked down at Lauren on her knees. I tried, really tried, to keep him out of my head when I came forcefully inside of her mouth. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** I woke up startled. I was hot and a little sweaty. I stayed in bed, my eyes wide open towards the ceiling, swallowing the blackness of the room. What was this dream about? I felt kind of nauseous. I rubbed my temples but my hands were shaking. The drumming of my heart was loud and painful. I squeezed my eyes shut in order to erase the vivid images but I had to reopen them immediately because I could still see them. I shook my head wildly to get rid of the memories of my dream and rushed out of bed. I went to take a shower, a cold shower, and ignored the attention my body was asking for. When I went back to bed, I cried myself back to sleep. ***===***===***J&E===***===*** Tanya waited for me by the door after class. She was tall, beautiful and one of the most popular girls in school. "Hey Jazz, are you going to the dance next Friday?" "Why are you asking, darling?" I teased. She smiled and licked her pink lips. I leaned closer enjoying the game. Students were coming in for the next class and we were shoved even closer to each other. It felt good. She bit her lip and I smiled, my eyes glued to her mouth. "So what do you say Jazzy," she breathed. "You and me, next Friday, at the dance?" I was about to answer when I felt the warmth of an arm brush against my back. My body quivered of its own accord. I saw Edward from the corner of my eyes as he settled in. I couldn't stop from remembering my dream. It made me feel angry and alive and hot. My breath faltered and Tanya's eyes darkened
