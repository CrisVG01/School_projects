Difficult. Very Difficult. Too Much Abilities For Tactical Reconnaissance You Hidden Inside Yourself. Not Having an Mind Full of Interest in Dark Wizardry Either. There's The Stealth You Shed From Your Very Scales, Oh My Goodness, Yes — and a Nice Thirst to Lead The Quidditch Team To Victory, Now That is Interesting... So Where Shall I Put You?" The Sorting Hat Asked as Dathris Told It,"Anywhere But Gryffindor, I Hate Showing Pride Towards My Friends and Besides, What The Hell is an Hufflepuff?" The Sorting Hat Then Made It's Decision "Not Gryffindor, eh? Are you sure? You Could Be Great, You Know, It's All Here in Your Head, and Gryffindor will Help You on the Way to Being an Hero, No Doubt about that — No? Well, if you're sure — Better be SYLTHERIN!"

Draco Was Getting Annoyed,"We Don't Need One!" Dathris Got Up From The Table and Told Draco,"Fuck You! I'm Taking The Role of Mascot and I Don't Need You Harassing Me On The Sidelines Because You Can Eat an Gryffindor's Dick!" Draco Then Countered,"Consider Yourself Disowned By The Quidditch Team!"
