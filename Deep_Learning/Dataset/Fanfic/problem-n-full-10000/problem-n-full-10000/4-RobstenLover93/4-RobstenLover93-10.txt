Summary- One arranged marriage, one child, and one epidemic later, and they are still together after a hundred years, but how is that possible anymore? According to them, it's the easiest thing they've ever done. Renee Swan's POV *1910* I didn't think setting up an arranged marriage for my oldest daughter would be so hard, but when she was to marry my best friend's son, then I was okay with it, but then I wasn't. I know my sweet Isabella would be perfect for any guy, even her own best friend, but I know it is going to be very strange when they get older. "Are you worried Renee?" Charlie asked me. "I am worried about how the children will take this, what if they aren't up for it? They might not like how we are forcing them to be married when they are older. I know I wasn't happy when my parents set up my marriage to you, but now I am so happy with it. It may be a lot different for Isabella, she isn't me. I'm also worried about Amelie. I know she is only six, but what is she going to think if she is there when we tell Isabella? Is she going to feel betrayed from us? Or will she be scared about her arranged marriage in the future? I worry she will hate us," I rambled. Charlie chuckled, and I glared at him. "You are so paranoid dear," he said. "Well don't you fear our daughter will hate us? I fear she will hate us for making her do something she doesn't want to do!" I exclaimed. "Do you know if she would like to marry Edward or not? She already loves him like cray, you are lucky that something hasn't happened between the two yet. She is sixteen years old Renee, not a child, she may understand," Charlie explained. "Charlie, do not say that!" I shrieked. I didn't need to think of my daughter already thinking about love, I knew with her marriage in a year or less, she may fall asleep, but not now. "Renee, sweetheart, you know it is true," he said. I huffed. Before I could speak again, the door opened and laughing was heard. "I'm home. Mother? Father?" Isabella exclaimed. She walked in giggling, and her best friend, Mary followed. "Hello Mary," I said smiling. I liked Mary, she was a nice girl. "Hello Mrs. Swan," she said. I smiled at her, and Isabella smiled again. "Did you hear mother? Mary is now engaged! She and Paul are deep in love! I wish for love soon mother," Isabella said. My eyes lit up, I had heard about Mary's arranged marriage, but didn't think it would be this quick. "We did grow up together, that may have helped," Mary said blushing. "Mother, will I ever be married?" Isabella asked. "We would like to speak to you Isabella," Charlie said. Mary grinned at her best friend and walked out the door, putting a finger to her lips. Isabella sat in the chair across from me. "Mother? Father?" she asked. "Isabella, your father and I have been discussing," I said. "We have been discussing your marriage, your arranged marriage," Charlie said. "Yes?" Isabella asked. "When your birthday comes in three weeks, you are to…interact with him to get to know him, as soon as possible, and then at the New Year, married." I said. "Who I am to be married?" she asked. I took a deep breath. "You are to be married to…your best friend, Edward." I said. I sighed in relief, happy to have it out of my system. "Edward?" she asked. "Yes," Charlie said. "I know you may be mad—"I said. She rudely cut me off. "Mad? Mother I am excited! Thank you so much!" she said with excitement. I was shocked, but I knew Charlie was not. She kissed my cheek and rushed off, to god knows where. "I told you she would be excited," Charlie said. I just shook my head. Bella's POV I was excited! I wouldn't…we wouldn't have to hide anymore. I could call him mine. I ran into town, and when no one was looking squealed in delight. "Isabella?" I turned around to see my best friend, Edward. I squealed again, and jumped into his arms. He immediately moved us so we were out of sight. "Have you heard? Huh? Huh?" I asked. "Calm down Isabella. Have I heard what?" he asked. "Our parents, they set us to be married," I said almost in a whisper. "Isabella, I can't understand you when you mumble," he said. "We're to be married," I whispered against his lips. We kissed with passion, and I enjoyed it, happy with the news that I had gotten. We broke apart, and I took a deep breath. "Are you sure?" he asked. I nodded my head. "My parents just broke the news to me, I ran to find you," I said. "I love you Isabella," he said. "I love you too Edward," I said. **January 1st 1911** ….. "You may now kiss the bride," the pastor said. Edward more like attacked my lips, and everyone stood and clapped. I didn't want to stop kissing him, but people were watching. We separated and faced forward while I blushed. I looked over at my best friend, and she smiled at me, holding my bouquet. "I love you my wife," Edward whispered. "I love you too my husband," I whispered back. **October 16th 1911** I heard a high pitch cry, and went to go back to the nursery, when Edward spoke. "I got her, go back to bed." He said. Our daughter, Anna Elizabeth Masen, born on my birthday, September 13th. She was our pride and joy. I was so glad that Edward had gotten our daughter, I had been sick all day, and didn't need to get our month old daughter sick, it would ruin her immune system. Before I knew it, Edward crawled back into bed, and I was out. **December 2nd, 1911** I coughed and coughed, it seemed I was just getting worse and worse over time. I had given my sickness to Edward, and he wasn't doing well either. Our parents had Anna so we wouldn't get her sick, and I was glad they did. "Edward…" I whispered. I knew he didn't hear me across the bed, but I didn't even care anymore. I hurt, I really just hurt, and I knew something was going to happen. But I didn't know what. I just hoped it would go away soon. **December 2nd, 1922** Anna's POV "Grandma! Let's go, I'm going to be late," I whined. "Sweetheart, they're not going anywhere," Grandma said. Eleven years, it seems like it was forever ago, I miss my family so much. "But they are Grandma. If I don't see them today, I'll feel like a bad daughter," I whined. Grandma put my coat on my shoulders and I slipped it on. She soon put her arm around my shoulder and I put my head on her shoulder. "They're not going anywhere baby. If you didn't visit them today, it wouldn't make you a bad daughter," Grandma said. "Yes it would. Its eleven years today Grandma, don't you know that?" I said mad. "I know its eleven years today since they died sweetheart. I would be a horrible mother and grandmother if I didn't," she said. "Grandma I miss them. I never even got to know them," I cried. I felt the tears prick my eyes, I cry all the time when I think of my parents, I was only four months old when they died. How was I ever supposed to know them? "You still have your pictures sweetheart," Grandma said. "It's not the same. I never got to meet my mommy," I cried. She rubbed my back, and I felt their presence around me. I knew they were here. "I miss them Grandma, but we need to go visit," I said wiping my tears away. "Come on Anna. Let's go," Grandma said. **December 2nd, 1987** I looked in the mirror at my non-aging face, stuck at twenty years old. I hated this, having to change my name all the time. I wasn't Anna Masen anymore, I was Anna Johnson, Anna Harris, Anna Jones, anything but me. I hated this. "I miss you mom and dad." I whispered. I would never see them again, I would never die. "Anna?" I turned around and looked at Michael. "My mom and dad died today 76 years ago," I whispered. "Oh Anna," he said. He wrapped his arms around me and I sobbed. "I'm never going to meet them. Never going to die," I sobbed. "Oh Anna. I know you will just you wait. I love you," he said. "Thank you for sticking with me for so long," I said. "We do have a long time." He said. I smiled. "I love you too," I said. **December 2nd, 2006** Michael smiled at me, I hadn't thought of it all day. But the picture of my parents at their wedding, burned in my back pocket. I kept their photo around all the time. It never left my sight. Michael and I were in Chicago, visiting my family's graves, but it still leaned toward the day. I felt people walking around us, and something fall. Fearing it was my phone, I suddenly turned around and saw a lady picking up my picture. When I bent down to grab it, our hands collided. She looked up at me with beautiful brown eyes, my human eyes. I chuckled and we both stood up. "You dropped this," she said. "Thank you." I said grabbing it from her. "Is it your grandparents?" she asked. "My parents," I said. "Wow. You can't be more than twenty years old…?" she said. "Anna. And you are?" I asked. "Isabella. It was nice to meet you Anna." She said walking off. She had walked not 100 feet and was talking to her husband, but I actually couldn't hear them. I looked down at my parents grave and see Michael put the flowers down for each of them. "I miss them all. I hope to see them again someday," I whispered. Michael wrapped his arm around my shoulder and we walked away. Until next year, when we would visit again. **March 18th, 2013** I blew my hair out of my face, and looked at the grocery list in my hand, we had to act human you know. We had just moved to Forks, and I was new to the supermarket, not knowing where to go. "Miss…do you need some help?" I looked around to see a pixie sized lady, with eyes like mine. "Uh yeah. My husband and I just moved here, I don't really know the store." I said scratching my head. She smiled. "Well I don't even know why you're here. You and your husband should come and meet my family," she whispered. "Family? I've never had a family," I said. Her eyes softened. "I'm so sorry," she said. "It's okay. My parents died when I was very little, I just…haven't had the connection," I said. "How about you come home with me now? I want you to experience the family connection!" she said. "I never did get your name," I said. "Alice…Alice Cullen, and you?" she asked. "My birth name? Or fake one?" I asked. "Your birth name," she giggled. "Anna…Anna Masen," I said. Her eyes widened, and I was confused. "Sorry, the last name seems familiar," she said. "I will call Michael, and we could follow you to your home?" I asked. The door binged, and Michael came in, with his phone in hand. "Michael! I was just about to call you," I said. "I know baby. Oh, who is this?" he asked coming to me. "Alice Cullen, nice to meet you," she said. "Michael Masen. Nice to meet you too," he said. "Oh, so
