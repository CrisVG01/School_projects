***Chapter One*** Scotland 1322 Gale Hawthorne silently materialized out of thin air. He stood in the shadows of the great hall and watched Peeta Mellark pace back and forth in front of the fireplace. Incredibly tall and handsome and powerfully built. Gale shook his head, aggravated. Peeta was a God among men, he could be so powerful, almost without limit if he would just give in and accept his fate. But he refused. "What grieves you Peeta?" Gale finally spoke. He would have thought Peeta hadn't heard him if not for the rigid tensing of his shoulders. "Why do you insist on coming uninvited?" Peeta's voice thundered across the room. It was a tone that could make even Gale shudder. "Well, that's simple really. If I waited for an invitation from you then I would never be here" he said as he moved closer. Peeta made a growling noise as his only response, continuing to stare at the flames of the fire. "Well, I can see you're unusually talkative this evening" Gale said sarcastically "but I fear I can't stay long. What say you...do you have the hallows?" He asked. Peeta didn't answer, he stayed staring into the fire and ran a very large hand across his square jaw that was covered in several days of stubble. Gale tapped his foot impatiently, "Your silence is NOT reassuring Peeta. I need an answer. I know The Templar knights where to escort them out from you, but I've heard there was a disturbance" he said. Peeta finally turned to him, muscled arms folded across his broad chest, he stared down at Gale, and Gale was a tall man himself. It was no wonder Peeta Mellark was a legend, even without any powers. "You heard right..." Peeta hedged. "You do realize you swore an oath to protect them" Gale said, suddenly on edge. "Of course I know that" Peeta said, turning back to the fire. "You also realize the Importance of the Templars finding sanctuary here in Scotland now that they've been disbanded? And how imperative it is that the hallows don't fall into the wrong hands?" Peeta dismissed his question with an impatient wave of his hand, "The four hallows are safe. The moment we became suspicious the Templars may come under siege, the spear, the cauldron, the sword and the stone were rushed back into Scotland for safe keeping, even with the war, It's better they rest in a torn country then with the persecuted Templars. The four hallows are safe..." Peeta said. "But not the flask, Peeta? What of it? Where is it?" Gale asked. "The flask is not a hallow" Peeta offered. "I know that.." Gale said dryly "..but the flask is a sacred relic to our race. It poses a huge threat should it fall into the wrong hands. So I repeat, where is the flask?" Peeta exhaled a sharp breath and pushed a large hand through his messy light hair. Gale was struck by the sheer masculinity of him, the power he exuded from every pore. The intense blue eyes, the fierce, aggressive, dominating temperament of his ancestors. Once again Gale lamented the fact that Peeta refused to embrace what he was. "I doona know" Peeta finally offered. "You 'doona know?" Gale mimicked his brogue. He knew that must have been a hard admission for Peeta. Nothing was ever out of the Laird Mellark's control. His whole life was governed by rule after rule. "A flask containing a sacred elixir created by my race disappears out of your grasp and you 'doona know' where it went?!" Gale asked, becoming agitated. "The situation is not as dire as you make, Gale. It's not permanently lost. Consider it..." Peeta waved a hand and flashed a smile, "...temporarily lost" he finally finished. Gale arched a brow at him, "You're splitting hairs with your pretty words. That's a woman's job, Mellark. What's happened?" "One of my good men was carrying the chest with the flask in it when the attack came, I was waiting for him to cross the bridge to hand it to me. He got hit in the head and both him and the flask fell into the river. The current carried away the chest-" "And you think that's not a terrible concern?! What if the king of England gets his hands on that flask, do you realize what that would do?" Gale interrupted. "Aye, but it won't come to that. I laid a geas on the flask. It won't come into another's possession" Peeta said. Gale looked to him, shocked. "You cast a spell?" "Think you I've learned nothing after all these years? I've picked up some things that were useful " Peeta said, obviously disgruntled by this whole conversation. "A clever fairy would have just spelled it back out of the river-" Gale started, "I am not Fae. I am Scot-Brude and I do not care for your Druid magic and spells. You're fortunate I used a spell at all" Peeta said bitterly. "And what invocation did you use? Were you careful in your wording? If it was not done right it's even more dangerous" "Aye, I did it well and proper. I spelled it so that the first human to touch the flask, it is to be immediately sent back to me. No matter the distance or time" Peeta said, mildly proud of himself for the curse as much as he hated to admit it. "I see. And did you specify whether the flask would come by itself?" Gale asked amused. "What?" Peeta asked bewildered. "The flask. Did you specify that only it be returned? Did it not occur to you that the mortal who touches it might also be transported with the flask if you used a binding spell?" Gale asked, wholly amused now. Peeta closed his eyes and made that growling sound again. "You used a binding spell." Gale sighed. "I used a binding spell" Peeta admitted. "It was the only one I knew!" He added defensively. "And who's fault is that? How many times have I asked you, nay, begged you to come with me to my world, to learn my ways. You could have so much power if only you would embrace it. And the answer is yes, Peeta. The man WILL be brought back with the flask" Gale said. Peeta muttered a few choice curse words under his breath. "So, what will you do with this man when he arrives?" Gale asked. "Question him, then return him with haste" "You will kill him" Gale said somberly, but with authority. "I knew you would say that. Gale, what if he's innocent? He may not have a fardling idea what's in the chest, but just finds it washed up on the bank of the river somewhere" Peeta protested. "Then you'll kill the innocent man" Gale said simply. "I will not" "But you will..." Gale started as he moved closer to Peeta. He had an urge to shake the man, or even to strike him but he knew that wouldn't end well for either of them, so he controlled himself. "...it is you who cursed it foolishly and without thought for the outcome. Your curse will bring them, innocent or no, into the midst of a Templar sanctuary that no one can trespass into. You think you can simply send them away with a weak warning of please-don't-tell-what-you've-seen? You think any stranger wouldn't be tempted by the price on the Templars heads? So you WILL kill him, whoever he is, because you pledged your life that you would do all in your power to protect the Templars and take no unnecessary risks" Gale said. "I will not kill an innocent man" Peeta said through gritted teeth. "You will or I will, you only have the two choices. So choose wisely because you know I like to play with my prey" Gale said. Peeta fisted both of his hands so hard he thought he might break open his palms with his fingernails. "I will kill the bearer of the flask. But it will be done my way, painlessly and swiftly and you will stay out of it" Peeta said angrily as he turned toward Gale. "Good enough. Now swear it" "On one condition. In exchange for my vow you promise me that you will never darken my home with your presence uninvited" Peeta said. " I am truly hurt and you will regret not having my company, but I will comply. Now, swear it". It wasn't something Peeta wanted to do but he knew he would be saving this poor innocent a terrible death at the hands on Gale Hawthorne, the dark fairy. He would find a way to live with himself. ***present day*** "Watch it asshole!" Katniss Everdeen yelled at the driver of the black BMW SUV who nearly side swiped her at the corner of the crosswalk. "Get a job, homeless trash!" The man yelled out the window before flashing his middle finger out the sunroof. Katniss scowled at him under the bill of her baseball hat. Homeless? She didn't look homeless...did she? She looked down at her clothes to do a quick assessment. She was wearing her favorite skinny jeans, while a cheap find on clearance at Target they were in good shape. Her white awolnation t-shirt was definitely worn but it didn't have holes and it was clean. Her red converse weren't in bad shape. The rattiest thing she had on was her hat, but she wasn't about to get rid of it. She pulled it down farther on her head in a self-conscious effort to hide her face. "What a jerk! Don't pay any attention to him, you don't look homeless. That's the kind of person who just believes they're better then everybody else, especially the ones waiting for the bus instead of driving a BMW. He obviously didn't see your face or he would be pulled over right now apologizing and trying to get your number" Madge said. Madge was pretty much Katniss' only friend. And Katniss wasn't even sure they were friends. More like acquaintances. They both took the same bus to work every evening. Madge to her acting gig in the local theater and Katniss to her cleaning job. "Thanks, but I doubt that's the truth" Katniss said to her friend. "Come on Katniss, you're a knockout. I wish you'd go out with me just one night, doll yourself up, live a little" Madge said, as she nudged her elbow playfully into Katniss side. "You know I don't have time for anything like that. Not with both jobs and taking care of mom and Prim" Katniss said. Katniss hadn't had time for anything, let alone a social life or boyfriend, since she was 18. That's when her daddy got killed in a terrible car accident and her mom completely checked out on life, leaving her to pick up the pieces and raise Prim. While paying bills and running the house, which they promptly lost and had to move into a tiny apartment in a crummy part of town. On top of everything Last year Willow Everdeen was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer, too far gone to even try any treatments. Katniss can't help but feel like she got cancer just because she stopped caring about life, she stopped living and so it consumed her without a fight. Mounting bills and paying for home health for Willow in her last few months and trying to save to send Prim to college forced Katniss to take on the barista job during the day and the cleaning job at night. Neither job was glamorous but they paid decent. And her cleaning job was in a museum, which she loved. It was her only escape from her reality. Yes, it was work but while she was there she would pretend to be something else, to be someone else. Her favorite section was the medieval history section. That's where she could
