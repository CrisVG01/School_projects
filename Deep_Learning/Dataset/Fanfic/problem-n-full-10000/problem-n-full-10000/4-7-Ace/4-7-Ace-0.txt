I Will Not Forget Chapter One: A Day of Hope I was sitting in my office when I got the call. "Hello?" I asked. "Oh, thank God! Bella! You need to come home!" my dad's neighbor cried out through the phone. "Beth, what is going on?" I asked, kind of freaked out by the tone in her voice. "Your dad just died in a car wreck!" I dropped the phone and stared at it, completely drawing a blank. Daddy? Not you too… haven't I lost enough?! "Bella? Bella? Sweetheart, are you still there?" "Yeah, sorry," I said, picking the receiver back up. "When can you get here?" she asked, trying to make sure I was there for my dad's funeral. "I'm leaving right now." I hung up the phone before she had the chance to say anything else. I grabbed my keys and my purse, and I hurriedly locked my office letting my secretary, Jessica, know that I would be out of town for a week. ***IWNF*** The following few days had been hell on my nerves. I had put together my dad's funeral within three days and within hours everyone my dad ever knew, and all of those who respected him, would be burying him. I wished my mom could have been there, but God must have wanted me to be alone with no one to care about me. I had always been a believer, but everyone has a habit of going their own way. Then there are those who tend to lose everything and everyone they have ever cared about. It started early for me. My mom died during childbirth and she only got to see my face once. I never got to know who she was or what she was like. After all of that, some drunken bastard hit my dad's police cruiser on his way home; he died instantly. They found the S.O.B. and as far as I knew, he got life in prison… I am so tired of jerks like that. Sue Clearwater and her kids helped set up everything, but I didn't pay much attention to them. I still couldn't believe what was happening to me. At some point, I had gone into the room that I had slept in my entire childhood, and I had locked myself away from everyone. After about five or ten minutes, there was a knock at the door. I got off of my bed and stood there waiting to see if they would leave. After I still heard the breathing for thirty seconds, I knew they weren't going to leave. "Who is it and what to do you want?" I asked, tired and completely ready to bite someone's head off. "Bella, it's me…" He didn't have to finish the sentence. I knew that scruffy voice anywhere. I couldn't help it, so I opened up the door and let him in. "Jacob? Why-why are you here?" I asked, starting to cry again. "How could I stay away? He was my dad just as much as he was yours, and I knew you'd need me." He pulled me close so that my head was resting on his broad chest and I started sobbing. Full out, shoulder shaking, knee-weakening, sobs. The whole time, he rubbed my back trying to soothe me before he carried me to the bed so that we could be comfortable. When we were kids, Jacob and I would always play and hang out together. He was the brother I never had. The fact that he didn't have any parents was a big part of it. His mom and dad had both died in a car accident, but somehow he had survived. Dad had taken him in when he heard what happened to Billy and Sarah. Since we were in school together, that just sealed the deal even more because my dad knew how important friends were at that age. I mean, losing your parents at the age of eight is crazy, and if it hadn't been for me, he would have gone off and lost his boyish passion. We grew up together from then on and after he graduated from high school, I was still in my sophomore year. He left Dad and I and went off to college, God knows where and did God knows what. He got lost in his schooling to the point that he'd hardly call. I couldn't believe he came home to see Dad's burial, after four years of doing his own thing. We laid on my childhood bed for about an hour, to the point where I was almost asleep, until he asked me what I'd been up to. I told him about what college was like, about my new publishing company, and how much I loved my job as a book editor. He listened really closely, as he always has, and asked me questions when he was curious or knew that I needed to know that he was listening. The time seemed to pass so quickly that the next thing I knew, it was time to go. "Oh God…I don't want to do this…" I rumbled into his chest. "Sweetheart, we have to. If we don't face this now, then we would have to deal with a lot of unfleshed out emotions later on. If we do it now, and face it head on like everything else we have, we won't have to do it later." He moved the hair out of my face, I nodded and sat up so that I could get ready to go. "Let's go. He deserves so much better than this…" Dad was the kind of guy who deserved to see and help raise his grandchildren that would be around some day, so did Mom, but that was beside the point. I got off of the bed and grabbed my keys off of my nightstand. Jacob and I held hands, more for the reason that I could barely walk straight without my knees buckling, walking down the stairs and out the front door. I saw Jacob's old motorcycle in the driveway, and I raised my eyebrows at him. I didn't know that he still had that old thing. He shrugged and said, "I had to get here fast, and she was the best way. Classics are always better than the new and improved." I nodded in agreement just before I turned to my car and got in. I couldn't help but compare the old motorcycle to my practically brand new Roll Royce Ghost. We were silent the whole drive to the church where we attended every Sunday growing up. I got out of the car, as Jacob walked around the car to grab my hand. Jacob and I walked in together and took our seats in the front. Everyone was watching us, and I can't help but cry because everyone expected the two of us to be in this church for a completely different reason when we were older. They never expected to be there to bury my dad because of something like this. He should have been able to at least die on the job in the middle of something where he could have fought for his life. This was a total waste, it wasn't with honor, it was a drunk driver who couldn't or more like wouldn't keep his mind clear enough to drive or take a cab. Every person that Dad ever influenced and inspired with his work, and all of his friends were there for this important day. We sat through the sermon for my dad that talked about how great of a man he was and because of his faith, and his service to humankind, he was going to a better place. Once it was over, the Quileute boys: Jared, Paul, Sam, Quil, Embry, and Jacob walked up and carried Dad's casket through the streets of Forks to the cemetery. I followed them out, and all along the street leading up to the cemetery, every one from the Forks Police Department, Forks Fire Department, other police officers and firemen from neighboring cities, and even the select military men that Dad worked alongside were lined up saluting him as he was carried to his burial ground. I continued to follow my father and watched the Quileute boys place the casket down on the lowering device. Jacob stood beside me when he was finished helping. Unsurprisingly, there were tears rolling down both of our faces. When everyone was gathered around the burial site, many people were crying and I started saying my goodbyes and thanked them all for showing their respect and support of everything that my father had done for them and for their world. I placed silver roses on his casket and then after Jacob was done, I leaned into him and let the tears fall freely, not caring whether or not I got Jacob's jacket wet. I watched as a few stragglers said their goodbyes to Dad until they all slowly started to walk away. Once everyone was gone, we had the worker lower my father into the ground. Jacob and I stood there watching Charlie lowering into the ground, and each and every click of the mechanical device drove a nail into that part of my mind telling me just how real the fact that my dad had died was. Once he was covered, I didn't stick around. I needed to be back in my room resting and completely away from everyone. Knowing that someone is going to die, say from like cancer is one thing because you're expecting it, but to have someone die so unexpectedly and seemingly out of nowhere messes with a person. Jacob grabbed my keys and helped me into the passenger seat, I didn't have any energy left. He climbed into the driver side and I leaned my head against the window, watching the rain stream down it, letting the tears go. I looked out my window the whole drive home and I couldn't help but wish that I'd been there for Dad more. I must have zoned out completely after a while because all of a sudden the car was at a standstill and Jacob was standing right outside my door. "Come on, sweetheart, we need to get you inside," he said opening the door to the car. I nodded and he picked me up out of the car and carried me into the house, and up to my room. He laid me down on my bed, and I fell asleep. ***IWNF*** After being in the SeaTac Airport for about twenty minutes, I had decided to sit down in a chair while I waited for my flight to show up. I was waiting for my flight home because Jessica had called me earlier that morning to tell me that they needed me in the office. Ever since I got that damned phone call about my dad, I hadn't been able to get my emotions under control; I couldn't stop crying for the life of me. It hadn't been until that moment that I had realized that someone was sitting right next to me and was holding out an embroidered handkerchief with the letters EC sewn into it. I looked up at him to see the brightest pair of emerald eyes I had ever seen looking back at me. I could see the look of concern in his eyes, and it took me a bit to realize that it was because of me. "Are you alright, miss?" he asked, completely enthralled by my crying and tear stricken face. All I could do was shake my head 'no' and I took the handkerchief from him so I could wipe my eyes and then my nose. "Are you coming or going?" he asked, trying to change the subject. "I'm going home." I looked up at him again, but as I looked at him, I couldn't help but notice his beautiful copper hair. "Were you here
