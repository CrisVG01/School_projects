Disclaimer : I don't own any of the characters here mention, I do however own a strange and disturbing love of unicorns, don't judge me they're majestic creatures. Hey everyone! Nice to see you here. Well I'm back with a new story, new topic, category and well everything. I wrote this a while back, during acceptance month. It's a tribute to a couple that have been together for a very long time and have loved each other trough hell and back, but are still in need of hiding from the world. I wish for them the freedom to say they love each other and that they are family, and to be able to marry and officially have that piece of paper that others take for granted. Love it love. How he makes me feel He smiles at me, his bright hazel eyes twinkle with mirth, as I sit shirtless at the deck on one of the comfortable loungers he just got. The sun is high at this time of day; the azure of the ocean reflects and intensifies the heat. It's summer in Malibu; time for barbecues at the beach, beers before sunset, and laughing with our friends at midnight while we play poker on the deck. It's wonderful. It's been this way since we moved here, we used to live in downtown L.A. in a one bedroom apartment, it was difficult but we managed it. Our families still didn't know about our relationship. Everyone just thought we were best friends and since we left Chicago we never gave our families a chance to visit. We'd always be the ones to go there for the holidays. Well until my niece, Melinda, dropped in unannounced with a huge problem. She was sworn to secrecy and in exchanged we helped, she's the only one in my family that knows about us. At that time I worked as a pastry chef at the Biltmore and he was the night manager, we were happy but then I got a great opportunity and started working at the Château Marmont. They love me so much that I worked out a deal and got him a position there too; it was a good thing since the Biltmore was having trouble at the time. With the new jobs came the new home. We found a great and surprisingly cheap Malibu beachfront apartment, a two bedroom. It was great at first, it was filled with college students and some elderly people, I felt happy. I could run every morning and he could surf and swim in the ocean everyday. It's been 5 years now and there are things that have changed, mainly our neighbors. We live on the 3rd floor of a 4th floor building. About two years ago our upstairs neighbors, a young couple, started complaining about our gatherings. While walking to the parking lot one day, I overheard a conversation between Jack, the upstairs neighbor, and Jane, who lives next door. He was complaining about our parties, but mostly he noted that we only had male friends visit. The conversation kept going and turned into gossip. Jane, she was curious to know everything since she was barely ever home. At some point in their conversation, he used a derogatory word to describe our friends, their behavior, the nature of our parties, and even us. After that I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach and haven't been able to talk to either of them since. I used to greet them in passing, but now I just nod or grunt. I really don't care to make friends since they're judgmental behavior will only hurt me in the end. It'd been a long time since I was called that and it hurt as if it had been the first time. I love my life, my work, my home, and my partner. That's not changing anytime soon, but I still hate it when we get the looks while we walk hand in hand, or when he leans in to kiss my check. I mean after all this time and the strides that gay men and women have accomplished we still get the looks, the sneers, and the "fag" comments. I come out of my musings and watch my sexy man intently. His hair has gotten lighter since we moved here, probably because he's constantly in the sun. The once chocolate brown with reddish streaks has now turned to light ash brown with blonde highlights. Healthy glow on his skin, the strong muscles and sturdy legs under those blue board shorts, a leather string around his neck with the promise ring I gave him when we decided to be "us" and his Ray Bans pressing his wild long locks back. He gives me a smile, he knows I'm checking him out, I love doing it, and he loves watching me doing it, it turns him on. "See I told you they were fuck awesome. Worth every penny!" He looks smug. I part my legs and he sits between them. His back to my chest, he pulls his sunglasses down and we sit there quietly. I stroke his arms slowly, run my fingers through his wild hair, and I hear his low hum of contentment. We were happy. So far. **~~J & E~~** He thinks I'm a cheapskate, but it's not that. I want us to have everything we need, but not be stuck to this place. I know material things will root us here. I've seen the neighbors, they don't buy it anymore, we've lived here for almost 3 years now and slowly but surely this once collage type of apartment complex has turned into a family oriented one and we are surrounded by young kids and parents. We come and go, they're polite and smile. We see them with their strollers, their family cars and their bikes with baby seats on the back or front. Most of them happy and alive, living in a place where everyone is close enough to nature, it energizes you and makes you different. You would think that people would be different, accept the differences and learn to tolerate and not judge, but it's not that way. Yesterday, I woke up to our upstairs neighbors arguing, he wants to keep his two seat car, she's pregnant and wants to trade it in for a family size car. Mundane arguments, decisions that we'll never have to argue over, it's just the two of us, and I think this is how it will always be. I'm turning 28 this year and I feel that I've accomplished most of the things I've set my sights on. I've traveled, I've gotten the degree and the position that I've always dreamed of, and more to my ever imagining it, I'm well known for my work. But the most important of everything, I've found an -end all and be all- type of love. If you knew us, you would realize that we are not the perfect couple. It was just never gonna be that way. Life gives you twists and turns that you either take, learn from them, or you fall. I fell, but he was right there to catch me, and that's when I knew. **~~J & E~~** I'm the eighth of nine children in my family; I have six older sisters, an older brother, and a baby sister. Our parents came from very large families and back then there was very little education on family planning. My brother was born the golden child, after six daughters my father had practically given up hope of ever having a son. He was surrounded by pink and long curls, dresses and makeup, squeals and girly-giggles. My mother, when they wed had promised him a son and was very worried that she might not be able to comply with this promise. My sister Alice was about five months old when my mother had the telling signs of a new pregnancy. She went to the doctor and confirmed her suspicions, but after so many disappointments for him, she decided not to tell my father about her state. My dad being a very unobservant man, especially because of the constant chaos at home and his work as an accountant, never noticed his wife's distending stomach. He chucked it up to weight gain or the new dress trends, for most of the pregnancy anyway. When she was eight months along she fell while mopping the kitchen floor and screamed in fright for her unborn child. My older sister, Esme, took her to the hospital and informed my father of my brother's early arrival, taking him by such a shock that he actually crashed his truck leaving my sister with an ugly wound on her forehead, ruining her otherwise perfect face. After the birth, my father was so ecstatic. Uncle Aro came to support my dad, and while talking about the new baby, he asked him what he looked like. Uncle Aro also had three daughters and had been wanting a son for a while now- my dad's answer was that his son was hairy and very manly. Bro's been teased about that ever since, he just shrugs and smiles his dimpled smile. His dark hair and bronzed skin made him look like a small replica of our dad. He was his dream come true and gave him everything he wanted and some things that he didn't even want. He was outgoing, musically inclined playing the guitar and the piano, a natural athlete – the running back of his high school football team, a great tennis player, a track star, and an awarded swimmer. There was nothing he could not do in my dad's eyes. The golden child, aka Emmett, was named after our grandfather a tough as nails man that never apologized for anything. He was a Ranch owner and a Cowboy. He loved his women and his whisky. His jet black hair, dark tanned skin, and his bright blue eyes made him irresistible to any female that crossed his path, and Emmett inherit that. At the tender age of six he kissed his first girl, and later that day her older sister came to visit and while our mothers drank tea and gossip we played in the yard. I was too busy building a fort out of dirt and rocks to notice that Emmett was nowhere to be seen. A few minutes later he walked out of the outside laundry room wiping spit from his lips and fixing his hair and behind him the older sister with flushed cheeks and swollen lips smiled shyly at his back. Yup, he was a regular Casanova. I was born 2 years and 3 months after him I was his total opposite; I was blond, green eyed paled skin, thin, and very sickly. My mother and older sisters fuzzed over me ever since I can remember, I was always on one of their laps being fed from their plates, or being dressed up and played with like a small doll, I would get to sit on their beds and listen to them talk, or sing and dance to their records or the T.V. Emmett was always being kicked out, there excuse? "You'll get everything dirty with your dark hands" yes, he was discriminated for having darker skin, I learned early on that I was lucky in this family. My mother was tall and regal, long ashen blond locks, her skin was as white as milk, and her lovely green eyes were completely replicated in mine, she was beautiful, strong willful and at times opinionated and disgruntle, being the youngest child in her family she was spoiled rotten, and her ultimate rebellious act was to marry my father. She always kept a special eye on me, I was always at her side, and like my father with Emmett, I was her favorite and in her eyes I was the sun. As I got older I noticed that
