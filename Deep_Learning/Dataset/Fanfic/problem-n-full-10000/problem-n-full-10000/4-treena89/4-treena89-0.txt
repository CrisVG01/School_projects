Okay this is a one shot I wrote because of a facebook picture I saw and looking at my children, I may have not always made the right choice in my life but I still tried really hard. I still wish for my prince to come or even an exciting relationship. So here is my story. I hope you enjoy it. Please read and review. At 6 years old "Mommy I love you so much" We made cookies and did finger paintings, we would play with model clay for hours, It was always just us and Edward because you babysat him, he was always there, We read stories of princess and princes, knights in shining armour slaying the dragon and saving the princess, When we would play dress up, Edward would always promised to save me from the dragon, from the tower I was locked away in, he even kissed me on the cheek when you weren't looking. I was falling in love with him, even then, At 9 years old "Mommy you know everything; Don't you?" You would tell me that I was so smart, that I could do anything I ever wanted, be anybody I wanted in this world, You wanted me to travel the world and go to school anywhere that I wanted, Study and be anything that I wanted, you said I was to make you proud and do whatever my little heart desired, but all I ever wanted to be was just like you, I wanted to be a mother that would bring happiness to her children, I wanted to be a wife that would make her husband smile every night when he came home from a long nights work, I wanted Edward just as much as he wanted me, we had dreams together of traveling the world and being together forever, At 13 years old "Mommy Whatever, Stop Embarrassing Me" You had decided to read my diary, how could you mother, those are my private thoughts I told you what you needed to know, did you need to know I was crushing on Edward, I think not But you went ahead and read it anyways, no going back from that now is there, You told me that I couldn't settle for a boy in this town, that I had to run as far as I could. I tried to tell you that Edward was sweet and would always put me first, You told me he was nothing more than a crush and I needed to put myself first, But I loved him so much and I know he loved me, he told me so, He told me I was his everything, that no matter what we would end up together, He had promised that we would be our first everything, In that moment he gave me my first kiss and told me he Loved ME More than anything in this world. Betting you didn`t know he asked me to marry him the first time that night, right after high school we would run away together, Travel the world and go to school, become anything we wanted together, You wouldn't listen though; you did the worst thing you could have ever done. At 16 years old "Mommy just stop I know it all, I love him, I know it, Nothing you do will change that Mom" All I wanted to do was apply to the same colleges as him, You wouldn't let me, saying that I needed to live and experience on my own, I kept saying I'm not you mom, I want to stay close to him and have his babies, You kept telling me one day I would regret that choice, that I needed to run far away from him and experience life and find a man to settle down with in years, No matter what we said, either family made us apply in different directions, You somehow convinced his family that this was best for both of us, I however did sneak out of the house the night before his family moved, We ran away to our meadow, and we made love to each other, He touched me in ways I never thought possible, he made me have the most powerful orgasm of my life, I squirted all over of his chest, causing his shirt to become saturated and shocked him, After I came down with him slowly kissing up my body, nuzzling into my neck, He asked if I was really sure, if I was ready to be his forever, I just kissed him deeply as he slowly pushed inside of me and taking both our virginity's, He just kept kissing me and whispering how much he loved and it was us Forever, He brought me the most amazing pleasures, I came so hard I almost pushed him back outside my pussy, He brought me to pleasures I have never know before him or since him, After giving are selves to each other, we became our first ever thing, we stayed there for 24 hours or more, We did every position and everything we could think of, After everything was over, we held each other whispering all of our feelings or love and lust for each other, We couldn't stop the promises the escaped our mouths, You promised to come back for me, to always find me no matter what, No matter how much time was to pass, I was always to wait for you, I knew I loved you no matter what was to happen, you gave me a promise ring, I promised you right back to always wait, to never marry or have children, Little did I know you left me a little present as far as I was concerned! My mother freaked and tried to force decisions on me, she told me we would take care of it, I didn`t like the venom in her voice, I ran to protect our little miracle; I ran away from home, as far as I could, I hope you to be proud of me one day, I could never let something happen to the piece of yourself that you left behind with me, At 19 years old "Mom I was never you but I am going to College" I have worked really hard and made many friend along the way, A woman named Esme is going to take care of my now 3 year old son, You would really like her and her husband, Carlisle is both of our Family doctors, He takes care of us for free, Never asks for a thing in return, They are so kind to us, they help take care of us and make sure I take time for me, She makes sure I don`t over work or study, take time out for the little things in life, She has even taken it upon herself to find me love, no matter how many dates Esme sets up with nice men, They are not you, I have tried to date but could never bring myself past a kiss, I have been waiting for you, hoping for you and wishing for you to find us, Someday I tell myself, I will see someone, someday and tell them about are son Tony, You would love him, I just know, He love's power rangers and baseball, He is so your son in every way, looks and personality, He is yours, Every day when I look at him he makes me miss your more, all it takes is one look or silly thing to make me laugh, I just miss you so much, At 23 years old "Mom you were right, but not what you think, I just hate being Alone, I miss him so much" Mom Tony is growing so fast, he is now 7 years old and the smartest kid in his class, Dad has long died, from a heart attack no less, I kept telling you to feed him better but you would never listen, I can`t bring myself to really talk to you other than once every few months, You sent him and his family away, I had to run and have barely spoken to you since, Not a word since dad died, I don't know if he ever came back or if you ever told him the real reason why I ran away from that town, really I ran away from you, you have always refused to talk about him or him family, I'm sorry I couldn't let you live your life through me but I really did want my child, I have worked really hard and have graduated college earlier, now I am going to upgrade to my masters, you might not be proud but I know Dad is, I am a English teacher in high school, I also write, I am living the dream for me, At 25 years old "Mom you were right about one thing, I would have regrets" The problems is we have different regrets from each other, My regret is in love, that fact my son does not have a father and that is because of choices you made for us, I wish I had grabbed a hold of Edward and ran away from that town together, If I could have done this by myself, Imagine what we could have done together, My son asks me at least once a week about his father if not more, He is so full of questions and just wants to hear stories about us together as kids, I wonder about him, he would have done great things in this world, I have googled him but nothing comes up so I know he hasn't done great things like I thought, At 30 years old "Mom I really just wanna come home" Last week I heard from someone that he was getting married, He never came back for me, he at least never found us, never look hard enough or fought hard enough, all that does is breaks my heart all over again, I ask you again if he ever came back and asked about me, you change the subject, Makes me wonder what you are hiding from us, I just hope he is happy, with whatever life he has chosen, All I know is I have the best part of him ever released into the world, Our son Tony is now 14 years old and is brilliant child, he says he won't have sex until he is married, because he never wants to accidentally leave a child behind, Because of our parents all 3 of us missed out on a great thing, our dream life that we wanted and had planned out, Many years later and your still the only man I have ever loved, the only man I have ever had sex with, and I miss you more now than ever, Our son refused to date until a women, until she catches his eye to the point where he would fight everything for her, At 34 years old "My son convinces me to go to college with him, a new town, a new home, a new life" After saying yes to you and your gut feelings, I move to freezing cold city of Chicago with you, I must love you so much my son, I find a job right away, we have a pretty nice apartment, we are happy in our lives, We have lived here for about 6 months when you say you are taking me to diner, You take me to the most popular restaurant in the city, You have reservations, I think you are trying to impress your old mother, I can't help but chuckle at you, You are so much like your father, so very cheesy and handsome, We are seated and order, we chat away and you tell me how school is going and I chat about work, Next thing I know is I hear my name being
