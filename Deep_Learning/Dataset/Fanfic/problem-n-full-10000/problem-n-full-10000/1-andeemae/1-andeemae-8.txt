Disclaimer: I'm just playing with Suzanne Collins' characters and her world. They're hers. Not mine. Of Mothers and Morphling It had started out well enough, but Madge really shouldn't let the Hawthornes talk her into supposedly 'fun' activities. Gale was in meetings all day and Vick and Rory had wanted to take her ice skating. Posy had been glum, she had a horrible cold and her mother absolutely forbid her from going out in District Two's frigid winds. Madge had been up to District Two about half a dozen times since she and Gale had gotten together. They were always pleasant trips, visiting with his family, seeing the District. During the summer they'd taken her swimming, an activity she was less than keen on learning. "I'll drown!" She'd whimpered, hoping to earn her some sympathy. The lone pool at the community center in District Twelve was never maintained, never filled, at least not in Madge's lifetime. Unlike Gale, she had never been in a body of water larger than her parents' garden tub. "I won't let you drown," he'd whispered back, blowing a little puff of air in her ear as he'd done so and sending a shiver down her spine. She had not died in dramatic fashion, had not needed to be resuscitated, though she thinks both Rory and Vick had desperately wanted to volunteer should the need have arisen. In the end, she'd spent most of the time on the shore of the little lake watching Gale and his siblings splash around in the water. When all was said and done, Posy won whatever game they had played and been deemed 'Queen of the Lake' and Madge had come to the conclusion that the whole ordeal was simply a ruse to get her into the awful swimming suit Gale had encouraged her to buy in District Four. Now though, deep in the winter and with considerably more clothing on, that same lake was frozen over. Thick enough, both the boys and the locals had assured her, to support several dozen skaters. She was still leery of it. Strapping sharp blades to the bottoms of her feet and running around on ice with them seemed a poor life choice, at least to Madge. District Two really was an odd bunch. She'd let them though, strap the frightening looking shoes to her feet, and pull her onto the ice. Rory had glided off, easy as you please, to a clutch of girls practicing pirouettes across from them. He was handsome as Gale, finally grown into his arms and legs, though from what Vick told her he'd also picked up some of his brother's less endearing traits. Specifically when it came to girls. Vick was a sweet as he'd ever been, staying at Madge's side until she found her feet. He still had his little dimples and his painfully sweet smile, still was the first of his siblings to hug her when she arrived with Gale, still liked to tell her about his day. He was still her dearest friend. She hadn't realized how much she'd missed him during the intervening years apart until he'd grabbed her the first time and hugged the air out of her. "He's such an idiot," Vick grumbled as he watched Rory pull off a sloppy looking twirl for the girls. One of the girls spotted Madge and Vick and waved. Vick's face deepened in color. "Someone has a fan," Madge giggled. She gave him a little shove, "Go say 'hi'." His face pulled back, "Why?" "She likes you," she huffed. "She isn't waving at me." "She might be. You're very pretty." Madge rolls her eyes at him. "I can't leave you," he tells her. She really isn't steady, but she's been upright for nearly ten minutes which is longer than she'd expected, so really the day could end now and she'd be happy. "I'll be fine. Go rescue that poor girl from your brother." Vick hesitates, Madge can see he really wants to go; she puts her hands to her hips in her most impressive imitation of his mother and glares. He snorts before gracefully gliding off toward the girl. It all goes well, as long as she doesn't attempt to move she's fine. For a full fifteen minutes the only motion she has is the gentle sway she can't help because of the wind. She watches Vick, much more awkwardly than Rory, but much more pleasantly than Gale, flirt with the girl. She's blonde, like many in Two, a pleasantly round face and bright smile. The inactivity, though, combined with the biting wind, gets to be too much, and Madge decides to try to slowly slide back to the shore. It isn't far, it should be easy. She had nearly made it, was less than a few yards from it, when a couple of boys, ten or eleven years old at most, came around the edge racing. The boy in front was skating backwards, taunting the one in back, a feat Madge would have been impressed with had he not proceeded to slam into her with full force. Her feet go out from under her and she shoots forward through the air and attempts to break her fall with her hands, which, as it turns out, was a very bad idea. She landed without grace or dignity on her face. ################################################################################################ In every Capitol program Madge had ever seen, when the characters had gone to the hospital it had been immaculate. A huge building with clean tiles and pristine rooms. Handsome and beautiful, young doctors and delicate little nurses and aides all eager to help whatever poor wretch came through the door. She should've known it was just one more illusion of the Capitol. District Twelve had no such hospital. Mrs. Everdeen and a handful of healers, along with the ancient physician who treated her mother, were the only medical professionals Madge had any recollection of. She'd thought, perhaps, District Two, being a Capitol darling, would've earned them a better level of care. That was clearly not so. The hospital, in the town where Gale's family lived, was little more than a small building. It might've been a storage house at some point, for paperwork maybe. Two story and dingy, the lights flickered occasionally, the little nurse, a red head with cherry colored lipstick, had to swat them every now and then when they went off. While the nurse was delicate enough, the doctor was anything but young and handsome. White headed with a bushy mustache and a bad leg, he'd hobbled in to check Madge's wrist, thrown the x-ray film up onto the wall and croaked, "Broken." "Can you fix it?" Vick had asked. He was wringing his hat. He was taking undue guilt for the mishap. The doctor, his name badge was backwards, Madge thinks it might be on purpose, grunts. "It's not the worst I've seen. We can do a closed reduction and plaster it up. Then you can take her up to the District Seat and they can take it from there. Might do surgery. Might just put another, better, cast on it. But I'm not in orthopedics." He looks at the little red head, her name is Angela, and coughs. She winces. "Get an IV started and, uh," he looks over at Madge, sizing her up, "five, uh, no ten of the morphling. This is gonna hurt like a bitch." The moment the words leave his mouth Madge is shaking her head. "No, I don't need it." "Young lady, this is going to be painful." She keeps shaking her head, "I'll be fine. I have a very high pain tolerance." Truthfully, she doesn't know what her pain tolerance is. She's never had any breaks before, a bruise here and there, but nothing this major. The thought of the morphling, thoughâ€¦ She'd watched it zap the life from her mother. Maybe it had eased the headaches, maybe it had only dulled the painful reality of her life, there's no telling, but it had stolen her from Madge. Her father had let it, let her mother become addicted to the bliss that came with it, made sure she was always in good supply. He'd loved her mother, Madge would never doubt that. She just wished he'd loved her enough to save her instead of comfort her for all those years. Rory, arms crossed and looking increasingly like Gale with his stern glare at the doctor, frowns. "Madge, take the medicine." Vick nods vigorously. She'd rather take the throbbing pain in her arm, whatever procedure the doctor wanted to do, than take that medicine. "I'll be fine," she assures them. #################################################################################################### Fine was definitely not in the list of words that Madge was once the doctor began. She'd bitten down on a strap, she'd been told by some of the people in Ten that's what they did when resetting dislocated shoulders. That and a healthy dose of alcohol. It had not helped in the least and she'd blacked out just after they'd begun. When she woke she was in a little room, definitely not in the town hospital, it didn't smell of old papers and dust. It was night, there was a small window in the corner, with the shades half drawn, and she could see the sun was gone and the lamp light was reaching upward from street below. The room was dark, it reminded her horribly of her mother's room back in Twelve. She tried to set up, but was instantly dizzy and collapsed back. Her head throbbed and swam, making her stomach churn, and she began groping around for something to vomit in. What did they do to me? She feels something on her uninjured hand and manages to peak down at it. An IV. Vick and Rory, those traitorous bastards, had let that girl put one in her once she'd passed out. Her foggy mind tells her to get the IV out. Her injured hand is immobile and she doesn't know why, but she doesn't care. The IV is what's important. She puts it to her mouth. She'll chew it out. Her teeth are just getting a grip on it when a large hand reaches up and stops her. Madge whimpers and the hand smoothes her hair back from her face. Warm lips press to her forehead. "Go back to sleep, Madge," the hand's voice murmurs in her ear. Such a nice voice . She decides to listen, and drifts back to sleep. ################################################################################################## When she wakes again it's still dark out, the clock on the wall, an ancient thing with hands and a loud tick, reads three. It must be in the morning. Her injured arm is hoisted up on pillows, a mass of wrappings are also present. She wiggles her fingers and thumb, nothing of it hurts anymore. There's a pressure on her stomach, and when she looks down she finds Gale asleep across her. One of his hands is holding her fee hand, the one she now vaguely remembers trying to bite the IV out of. It's still there and she curses she hadn't gotten it out. His other hand is on her stomach, under his head. He's got the blankets between gripped in his fingers. "Gale," she rasps. Her throat is terribly dry. "Gale." He stirs a little, eyes bleary when they finally peak open and peer up at her. "How're you feeling?" He sits back and stretches, before reaching up and brushing some of her surely disgusting looking hair from her face. She shrugs eyes falling to the IV. "I want it out." He shakes his head, "They had to do surgery. They want it in until you can eat." "Then give me food. I want it out." He stands and gingerly touches the exposed fingers on her injured hand. "It doesn't even-" She freezes. It doesn't hurt. They did surgery and it doesn't even hurt. Her heart races and she feels a
