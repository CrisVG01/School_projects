The Summer That We Will Never Forget ***Clove main character*** ** Cato, Glimmer, Marvel, Katniss, Peeta, Finnick, Annie, Thresh, Foxface** Clove's POV I play Kesha's song 'Timber' and turn the volume on my iMac on loud, and the girls go wild. "Glimmer! Twerk for us!" I scream Glimmer starts twerking, well - "twerking", as she can't actually twerk but it's fun watching. We all fall on the floor laughing "Hey, what are you guys laughing at? i've improved, haven't i?!" She says seriously, but her face breaks into a smile and joins in the laughter "Oh, guys my phones ringing be quiet, i think its Marvel" Says Glimmer We all wolf-whistle "oooohhhhh" She gives us the middle finger and mouths 'fuck off' and walks out the room "What do you think Marvel's saying to Glimmer?" says Katniss "Who knows, probably begging for her to go out with him or have sex or something stupid like that" Says Annie we have to put our hands over our mouths to stop us screaming with laughter "Oh and Clove? Can i borrow your pink Nike Air Max's?" Says Katniss "Sure, can i use your Prada Candy perfume?" I reply "Sure" Me and the girls basically live off eachothers stuff, and we don't even expect to get our stuff back anyway because we know we aren't getting it, oh i love us. Glimmer comes back into the room with a HUGE smile on her face "Marvel, Cato, Peeta and Finnick are going to the Cheer and Soccer camp this summer!" She basically screams We all scream with happiness, the boys almost weren't coming but they decided they may as well go because we were going to be there all summer and they'd be lonely without us. ha. It's so annoying, Glimmer and Marvel are like f-buddies, Peeta and Katniss are like an item, and Finnick and Annie are practically dating, and then theres me and Cato. We always feel sorry for ourselves because we're the single ones, but i'm 100% sure Cato sleeps around with loads of girls. So that leaves me on my own. we've just broke up from school and we're all having a big sleepover at mine to celebrate before we go off to Cheer and Soccer camp. We're going to Annies pool party first though, then heading to mine later, though we'll probably go and get a mcdonalds and Cato gets served, so to the Wal-Mart for some booze. "So are they going to the pool party? or are they just meeting us at Wal-Mart"I finally say, kind of happy the boys are joining us "Yeah, they're coming to the pool-party" Says Annie "So Katniss, what are you and Peeta going to do later?" Says Glimmer excitedly Katniss smiles and taps her nose, nobody actually knows about their sex life because she's so secretive about it, it makes us so annoyed i mean - we want deets? "Right girls, lets get ready" I put on my Levi shorts, followed by my Vicorias secret bright pink bikini shorts, then slip on my Michael Kors sandals and matching sunnies and chuck a VS PINK towel into my Speedy 30 Louis Vuitton bag along with a spare Chanel top and VS undies Glimmer, Annie and Katniss and i each have a different shade of Levi shorts on and different VS bikinis, "We look like princesses" I say "Agreed" Says everyone at the same time, then we all laugh "Annie, who's driving?" Katniss asks "Um, not me i've already drank!" says Annie. Typical Annie, it's only 5 o'clock. "I will" i say, just for an excuse to drive my brand new convertable Range Rover, as a summer present from my Dad. "Just to show off the new ride!" Laughs Glimmer "Yep." i say, "Pass me the keys?" Katniss chucks them over, and i could of sworn i almost lost an acrylic, but i didn't, so i quietly thanked god in my head. We all head out to the car and chuck our stuff in the back, and i start the car and put on the usual tunes, Kesha and our latest CD's We get to Annies after 20 minutes of traffic and start setting out the tables and food and putting decorations everywhere, half an hour later the back yard was filled with 70 more kids from our schools, laughing and dancing to the music and jumping in the pool, but me and the girls were on the sunbeds, laughing drinking ice tea and reading TeenVogue, waiting for the guys to get here so we can actually have fun. "Omg, did you hear that Miley Cyrus is like so totally slutty now?" Says Annie "Yes, we knew that ages ago Annie babe" i say, "you've just been too drunk to notice" then they all laugh then my gold iPhone 5s rings, and it's Cato "Hey Cato, where are you guys? We're waiting for you guys!" "O, miss me do you?" He laughs "Not funny! Get here now, before i beat you up!" I laugh "Oh i can't wait for that! we're just at Thresh's because we're saying goodbye before he goes to Miami for the summer, we're coming now" he replies Thresh is our really good friend, he hangs out with all the chavvy people but he's mega-rich and his dad's 50 Cent. "Okay, see you soon" "Bye beautiful" Says Cato and before i have a chance to reply he quickly hangs up. My heart nearly stops. He called me beautiful, he must of been joking but i still feel really happy. Glimmer must of noticed "Oi Clove whats with the smile" She says "Nothing, i didnt realise i was smiling" I reply, and quickly look down to my magazine and sip my ice tea, then the girls exchange looks, thinking i wouldnt notice "Hey, i mean it, i actually wasn't smiling! well, he called me beautiful" I say quietly, and that sets them off "OMG" "YOU'RE PRACTICALLY DATING" "HE'S SO INTO YOU" "ARE YOU GOING TO GET WITH HIM TONIGHT?" I just look down at my magazine and try to ignore them, and eventually they shut up. 5 minutes later, Peeta, Finnick, Marvel and Cato come running towards us with water pistols, we all scream for ages and shout curse words at them "CHILL., CHILL, keep your panties on ladies" Cato says, then looks over and winks at me, then Glimmer gives me a nudge "Yeah, they're not full don't worry, Thresh gave them to us" Says Marvel, then they all put their pistols down. "Oh, thats why you took so long" Says Annie, catching Finnicks eye, then he goes up to her and puts his arm around her waste and she starts to smile. I feel a little flicker of jealousy, i hoped it didn't show but Cato saw my face and rolled his eyes in a jokey way, at least he understands me. "Hey Marvel, want to get a drink?" Glimmer says in a major flirty way, and his face lights up "Thought you'd never ask!" Then they walk away Peeta and Katniss walk off, talking about some TV show on MTV that they'd both seen, so that left me and Cato on our own. He walks closer to me and looks me up and down "Hey, that bikini looks great on you Clove" "Thanks Cato" I give him a big smile, and i feel butterflies in my tummy because i was so flattered, and i can't help noticing his hair so soft and his jean-shorts, and his amazing shirtless body "You look great by the way!" i add, then he smiles at me and gives me a wink. my tummy goes fluttery "Thanks Clover" He says "Hey, don't call me that!" i laugh flirtatiously Then he picks me up, one arm with my legs wrapped around and the other supporting my back "Lets go for a swim shall we?" "NO OMG PUT ME DOWN CATO!" i scream, and they whole party stops and looks at us, then Glimmer gives me a happy look, and he puts me down "Oi chill, i wasn't going to throw you in, silly! stop worrying all the time!' then he puts me down on the sunbed and sits next to me, and then tucks a strand of my waist-length black hair behind my ears "You look really gorgeous today Clove" He smiles "Wait, what are you doing?" i say slowly "What do you mean?" he says, and looks at me weirdly "You're flirting with me, why?" i say Then he starts to laugh "You got a problem with me flirting, Clover?" he smiles "Well, yes, um , no i don't know maybe? And stop calling me Clover, you know i don't like it" I reply "Well sorry" says Cato my eyes are fixated on his. I laugh, " Sir Cato, now would you care for a drink?" I joke "Well of course, Princess Clove," he replys, and with that we both go back to join the others. "Hey guys!" Says Glimmer "Hey gal" i reply Cato goes and speaks to Marvel and Peeta and Finnick, so it's just us girls "OMG, so what happened with you and Cato?" Says Katniss The girls stare at eachother for 10 seconds, then start squeaking loudly "GUYS! shut up, the boys are looking!" I say, and i can feel Cato's eyes staring at me "Clo, Cato wont stop looking at your ass" whispers Annie "Not just that though, he's staring at her in general" adds Glimmer I smile to myself, feeling good "Whats going on with Marvel, Glimmer?" I ask "He's asked me on a date, tomorrow afternoon after we leave Cloves house, but i'm not sure if i can, i have so much to pack for Monday for the Cheer and Soccer Camp!" She says with a worried look. "Glimmer, it's saturday tomorrow, just go!" I say "Yeah, you deserve it!" Says Katniss, then goes over to Peeta and they walk away again, i guess they were dating now. Then the other two girls and i go over to the guys, who were by the food and i grab myself some crisps, then i feel Cato next to me. "Hey Clove, i got you a drink" "Aw thanks, want some crisps?" I smile "Yeah thanks" Handing me the drink, "How does a girl like you eat so much and still have a lush body?" He says, looking me up and down. i give him a little nudge "Hey, Romeo, up here" I laugh, pointing to my face, and he laughs too, then puts a crisp in his mouth, and before we can say anything else we hear Annie shouting; "Come on guys! Lets go for a SWIM!" And with that, we all take off our shorts and jump in, although all the other kids were dancing, we were laughing around the pool, i feel Annie grab me round the waist "Hey Clovie, you're looking hot today" She jokes "And so do you, Annie baby, come here sexy!" I exclaim, and me and Annie do our usual best-friend make-out session in the pool, just to get the boys going, i hear all the guys whistle, but i notice Cato and Finnick looking a little jealous, but you could tell Cato was loving it. Then i realised to myself. After me and Annie break apart we break into fits of laughter, and i feel flirty, so i go over to Cato "Why do you and Annie do that? You freaks" He jokes, but he was smiling "I think someones a bit jealous.." I tease "Trust me, i'm never jealous" "Oh real funny Cato" I joke and go back to Glimmer, and we get out of the pool. After a few more hours of dancing with my girls, the guests go and we clear up the party and we get in the car to go back to my house. we ride down the highway with the music blaring out the speakers,
