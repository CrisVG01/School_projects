Under construction If one were to ask around Manhattan New York about a boy with stunning green eyes they would immediately tell you the young trouble maker is non other than Perseus Jackson. Everyone knew Percy after the incident that happened at the Jackson house only a year ago when Percy was still only seven nobody was there at the time all anyone knew was there, a loud blood curling scream and then silence one of the neighbors called the cops once they arrived all they saw was a body a body so horribly mutilated nobody could recognize the gender or who it was so everyone generally assumed it was Sally Jackson. After doing a full apartment search they found nothing, after not finding anyone they started questioning the neighbors who all said the same thing "All we heard was a scream and then nothing" some were more worried about Percy than Sally asking questions such as "Where's Percy the poor kid lost both his parents" or "Sally was a wonderful mother" or even "Start looking for the boys dead beat father we have a few choice words for him." After the investigation the cops found absolutely nothing so they went to go find young Perseus in hopes of bringing him in for questioning Percy not wanting to talk to anyone at that point in time ran, seeing that he wasn't coming with them willingly they gave chase but only found hints of where he was here and there it became kind of a game for the locals to catch Percy. Right now we find the 8 year old running from two policemen that gave chase almost every day this was a natural occurrence for Percy by now and it is always the same two cops Hebert and Frank "Hahahaha" came Percy's resounding voice in front of the two cops they lost him for a short while until he laughed then took off again with both giving chase the two cops had taken a real liking to the boy because of his charismatic attitude and how happy he is even though he was living somewhere on the streets right now. He jumped on top of a hot dog vendors booth while pulling down his pants he started shaking his butt and screaming "Herbert the pervert and Frank Furter want to touch meeeee" all the perverts and even the more refined people started to blush wondering if this eight year old knew exactly what he was implying. Herbert and Frank blushed the hardest for basically being called pedophiles taking advantage of their embarrassment Percy ran back to his hideout laughing all the way getting back to his hideout he sees three kids there scavenging through his stuff his father had already told him all he needed to know of the Greek gods and their children so much so that by just looking at these three he had a good indication on their parentage. Percy knew that he was being unreasonable but something in him snapped at seeing strangers even if they were fellow street rats going through his stuff. Percy's anger at seeing his stuff being taken turned into pure rage when he saw the girl with black hair take the only picture he had of him and his mother he had left and put it in her pocket so lost in his rage he summoned one of the weapons his father gave to him Fragarach also known as The Answer or The Retaliator this sword was known because no one could tell a lie or even move, with Fragarach poised at their throat. It is also said that the user has command over wind which enabled them to cut through almost anything, and had a piercing wound from which no monster could recover using these wind's came with a huge burden though. Percy couldn't care less in this situation he started breathing heavily finally noticing the pissed off boy behind them the kid with the blonde hair was first to speak and tried to introduce himself "Hi I am Lu-" the kid didn't have time to finish his sentence before Percy interrupted his voice raging with uncontrolled malice which was a huge switch for the normally happy boy. "What are you doing to my home" Percy asked voice shaking That's when the trio of half bloods noticed the beautiful sword in his right hand which was currently glowing wisps of blue light but it wasn't the fact the sword was glowing with power that scared them it was was how white his knuckles were from squeezing the sword. Seeing this one of the two girls the one with black hair that had taken his picture decided to crack a joke "whoa whoa calm down girly" it wasn't a very clever joke but Percy took offense due to his shoulder length hair it was very easy to mistake him for a girl. The joke hitting a nerve judging by how the wind started to pick up, Percy made a slow back hand motion with the hand that wasn't holding the sword causing the girl with electric blue eyes and black hair the very same girl that cracked the joke went flying and hit the wall that was behind her hard enough to knock her out that's when the two remaining blondes adopted similar looks of fear on their faces. Causing Percy to smirk he doesn't like having to hurt people but he could make an exception for the ones that were destroying everything he worked to build in the last year. But while Percy was debating what to do these the remaining two street urchins he never noticed the animal or was it a human thing sneaking up on him from behind with a frying pan in hand the two blondes noticing this let out sighs when the goat thing smacked the scary boy in front of them, Percy's last thought was how could he have let his guard down. ~Hour Later~ While Percy was out cold the trio was thanking their savior as they tied Percy up waiting for him to come to his sword disappeared when he was knocked out Thalia came to after about 30 mins and she was not happy it at all. It took all of her self restraint to stop herself from electrocuting the kid that had completely outclassed her another, she was shocked by the beast thing that her two friends were currently talking to Annabeth said that it was a creature called a satyr and his name was Grover they all talked waiting for the scary girl looking kid to wake up that way they could all go to this magical safe haven camp Grover was telling them about. When Percy finally woke up he found himself tied up to one of the many benches in New York with those no good trespassers watching him with a humanoid goat they were all just staring at him he glared back with an animal like growl. "C-calm D-down" the timid goat man said which Percy assumed could only be a satyr Thalia added in her two cents "yea calm down we have you tied up" The little blonde haired girl probably the youngest of them introduced herself as Annabeth then proceeded to go on a boring rant about how they were all demigods and demigods have to stick together and they're all going to camp half blood Percy knew all about the camp that's why when she was finally over he yelled "O JUST SHUT UP I ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID NOW LET ME GO" that seemed to shock everyone further before Luke trying to get a hold of the situation said "Woah man calm down and we can't let you go you're one of us." Percy gave Luke the dirtiest look he could muster "you better close your eyes" the long haired youth said before they could complain he started to glow with the light of the sun forcing them to close their eyes when they opened their eyes again he wasn't there anymore then the blonde male felt pressure on his neck and a voice whisper in his ear "what was that you were saying" the rest looked at Percy in shock. He just straitened up letting the knife fall "you're all lucky I want to get out of this place or you all would have been killed for trespassing and stealing" that was a lie cause Percy has never taken a life before but it felt like the right thing to say at the time. Grover said that the camp wasn't too far from here but still too far to walk and Grover had spent all his money on cans "I know a perfect and easy way to make money" Percy said with a devilish smirk on his face. Percy turned to Thalia and Annabeth "I know you girls are too young for this but you're just gonna have to take one for the team" Annabeth and Thalia immediately got scared Percy continues "Okay now I've lived here my whole life and I know some real perverts around these parts now I want you two to go out and be night walkers it's gonna take awhile till one of the perverts buy you but if my calculations are right with the money we make we'll be set for life" It took awhile for them to get what Percy meant but when it settled in the ones that understood blushed, Thalia looked murderous while Annabeth was lost Thalia's fist started sparking with lighting she punched Percy in the face while yelling "PERVERT". Percy got back up smiling like he didn't just get punched and his right cheek wasn't sparking he said "fine I know a real way but when It's over no one can ever talk about it" they all nodded and Percy grabbed the items that meant the most to him one being his guitar and lead them down 5th avenue as they walked Thalia, Luke, Grover and Annabeth noticed how Percy was getting hi's from everyone that noticed the boy, they stopped at a busy street and Percy got his guitar out when people saw that percy had his guitar out it was like everyone just dropped what they were doing and came to listen hearing things like "Mommy Percy's gonna play again" "Hey look it's Percy" "Dude get your phone out you're not gonna wanna miss this kid play." When Percy got his guitar out it was a beautiful sea green color he left the case open for tips and he just started strumming "this song is called boulevard of broken dreams" I walk a lonely road The only one that I have ever known Don't know where it goes But it's home to me and I walk alone I walk this empty street On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams Where the city sleeps And I'm the only one and I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk a... My shadow's the only one that walks beside me My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 'Til then I walk alone Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah, Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah I'm walking down the line That divides me somewhere in my mind On the border line Of the edge and where I walk alone Read between the lines What's fucked up and everything's alright Check my vital signs To know I'm still alive and I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk a... My shadow's the only one that walks beside me My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 'Til then I walk alone Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aaah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah I walk alone I walk a... I walk this empty street On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
