Frodo's legs buckled underneath him, but he kept running. If it weren't for Aragorn's unyielding insistence that they reach Lorien by nightfall, he would have fallen to his knees and let the ground swallow him up. Gandalf was gone. His mind struggled to grasp the unthinkable. There was a dull emptiness in his chest, and his unshed tears were driving a rod through his throat. All the while he ran, he repeated to himself: It is real. It is true. Vaguely he realized that he was gasping for breath, but it didn't matter. The thought occurred to him to fall back. Maybe he could slip unnoticed away from the rest of the Fellowship. By the time they realized he was gone, he would be back in Moria where he should have perished instead of Gandalf, his body being torn to shreds by ravenous orcs. His company wouldn't try to go back for him there, and no more of them would have to die for him. But then he remembered: if the Fellowship was not successful in destroying the ring, they would all die anyway. He ran on. Frodo had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he didn't realize when they had reached the woods of Lorien until the trees closed around them. Their pace slowed, and Frodo could hear the rest of the party struggling for air as he was. Gimly turned back to make sure Frodo and Sam were still with them. "Stay close, young Hobbits," he advised, reaching his arm out to bring them closer. "They say a great sorceress lives in these woods." He turned and continued into the forest, axe in hand. "An Elf-Witch, of terrible power." His eyes scanned the trees. "All who look upon her fall under her spell." Frodo... Frodo's head snapped around to find the source of the voice echoing through his mind. Your coming here is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, Ringbearer. Frodo clasped his head in his hands. His mind shouted against the elusive voice. I do not wish to bring evil to anyone! I did not ask for this burden! Suddenly there were arrows aimed at all their heads, held steady by fair elves that seemed to have appeared out of thin air. After a moment of tension, Aragorn began speaking to their leader. He knew him, Frodo realized. Studying them, he wondered how and when the Elf had made Aragorn's acquaintance. "Come," spoke the leader after a brief exchange of words. "She is waiting." *** That night they made camp under the shelter of the woods and the protection of the Lord and Lady of the Galadrim. Their bedrolls were all arranged within relative proximity of the fire; Aragorn had allowed them a fire this time. Frodo sat on his bedroll as they prepared to sleep for the night, looking down at the ground as he drew patterns in the soft soil. Gimli was right; Lady Galadriel had been bewitching, but when she greeted them, Frodo had been unable to appreciate her light through the darkness in his heart. He heard Aragorn's footsteps approach beside him. "It should have been me," Frodo said, his voice barely higher than a whisper. "Ah, little one." Aragorn knelt beside him. Frodo's attention didn't turn from his mindless tilling. "We all feel Gandalf's loss." All at once the tears that had been welling in Frodo's eyes spilled over and he was gripped by grief. Aragorn folded him in his arms and Frodo buried his face in the man's chest. "I can't take it," he said between sobs. "I can't let all of you go to your deaths for me." "No, Frodo. Do not feel responsible for Gandalf's death. He died not for your sake, but for all of Middle Earth." Frodo tried to allow Aragorn's words to comfort him, struggling for a long time with images of Gandalf and trying to put them out of his mind. He knew Aragorn was right. The quest was not for his sake. He was simply the only one who could carry the ring without desiring to use it, either for good or ill. Slowly his tears calmed, and his sobs quieted to the occasional hitch in his breathing. The ranger's strong arms were still wrapped tightly around him. His embrace enveloped Frodo completely. The warmth and virility emanating from Aragorn was like a magnet to Frodo, soothing and fascinating him at once. His scent was like musk and amber; so rich and sweet. Frodo's body began to react, and he found himself wishing that Aragorn's mouth would descend upon his. Shock stilled his thoughts. He steeled his mind against the shame that welled up in him. Aragorn released him and rubbed his arms lightly. "Have faith, little hobbit," he said. "You are not as alone as you may think." While Frodo pondered what Aragorn meant by his statement, he silently hoped that Aragorn did not notice his predicament. He knew the fire was not providing enough light for the man to see the evidence of his arousal, but he just hoped it wasn't written in his eyes. His face was burning. "Thank you, Aragorn. Thank you for your...concern, for me. I-I should very much like to...bed down...for the night now." Frodo's cheeks grew even hotter. Somehow that statement hadn't sounded quite like he had intended. "I mean..." "I understand, Frodo. I shall take my leave of you now. But do not be ashamed if you find you have need of a friend's conversation. I will be on first watch. Sometimes an understanding ear can do much to heal." How like Gandalf he sounded in that moment. Frodo was grateful that Aragorn seemed to have mistaken his present awkwardness for shame of another sort. "Thank you." With a final pat on Frodo's shoulder, Aragorn stood up and walked to the other side of the fire, where the vantage point was best for keeping watch. Frodo breathed a sigh of relief as he watched him walk away, unable to resist stealing a glance at the ranger's taut backside. As he lay down on his bedroll, his mind was filled with the uninvited image of that backside flexing and thrusting in the rhythm of love. He shoved it aside as quickly as he could, but not before his breath caught in his throat. Go to sleep, silly hobbit! Aragorn placed another log on the fire before walking back to the tree near his bedroll. Cloaked in darkness, he observed the enigmatic hobbit who lay on the other side of the camp. He could tell that Frodo had become uncomfortable in his embrace. Even before Aragorn had released him, his body had become frozen and tense. At first he had assumed that Frodo was embarrassed; he had been so very unselfconscious in Aragorn's arms, burying his tears in his chest and grasping at great handfuls of his tunic. Was Frodo ashamed at his display of emotion? Now that he reconsidered that, it didn't seem likely. Gandalf had taught him much about the little halflings, and Aragorn had been ravenous for the knowledge. From what he knew about them, they were not prone to displays of foolish male pride as men were. To a hobbit, there would be as much shame in crying as there would be in laughing. And then he remembered something else that Gandalf had told him, something that had provided for many amusing conversations. It seemed that they were quite put off by relations between two males. So put off, in fact, that they made sure to be quite vocal about it whenever they got the chance. It irritated Gandalf to no end, since they already held him in the highest suspicion simply due to the fact that he was an Outsider. He was sure that they would send an angry mob after him if they discovered that he preferred relations with men. Were hobbits made so uncomfortable then by the idea of contact between two males that they would refuse an offer of comfort when it was given? That didn't seem right either. Frodo was no ordinary hobbit, though he wouldn't be all wrong to be wary of Aragorn in that sense. What then? It seemed a mystery that wouldn't be unraveled this night. Aragorn reached into his pack beside him and pulled out his pipe and a small leather sack filled with the finest Old Toby the Prancing Pony had to offer. He chuckled to himself, realizing that the habit of smoking was yet another contribution Gandalf had made to his "education." For the first time, he bowed his head and let his heart be grieved for the loss of his friend. Long hours passed. Aragorn kept himself awake smoking and remembering old Elvish folk songs he had been taught as a boy. His companions were sleeping more soundly than they had since the quest began. All except Legolas, who was passing the night with old friends, but had agreed to relieve Aragorn halfway through the night. He considered that they probably didn't need to keep a watch tonight, since the Lord and Lady of Lorien were effectively providing that for them, but he didn't want the company to be surprised by anything. Gimli's snoring, after all, could be heard for 20 leagues. He noticed, to his amusement, that all the hobbits seemed prone to talking in their sleep. There were mostly just soft moans and unintelligible interjections, save for the one instance when he thought he heard Pippin whisper, "It comes in pints?" He had little doubt what the rascal was dreaming about. The one exception to this trend seemed to be Frodo. He had neither moved nor made a sound since his curly brown locks had met the bedroll. It almost made Aragorn concerned, until he realized he could just barely make out the rapid movement of Frodo's eyes behind their lids. Aragorn marveled at just how unlike other hobbits he was, and in so many ways. While other hobbits would sneer in suspicion at a wizard like Gandalf or an elf like Elrond or Legolas, Frodo looked up at them, wide-eyed, eager to learn all they had to teach him. Frodo was unique physically as well. His features were so refined. So flawless. Very un-hobbitlike. In comparison to Frodo, Aragorn thought other hobbits looked like gourds that had been left for too long on the vine. And his eyes! Aragorn thought that eyes so intensely blue could not be found even in the finest elvish artwork. And even though he knew that Frodo was the oldest of all his hobbit companions, Aragorn could see that the possession of the ring had preserved his youth. It seemed a shame that Frodo must destroy the ring. Aragorn would see Frodo's beauty preserved forever if the consequences did not demand otherwise. But they did demand. Aragorn recalled Frodo's pain, and wished with all his heart that there were some way to spare him from it. He had never met someone so pure, so undeserving of all this grief, but it seemed that Frodo was the only one for the task. If he could, Aragorn would destroy the ring himself, even if it meant hurling himself into the very fires of Mordor to do it, but he knew it was no use. Instead he would give Frodo all he had to offer: his sword, his protection, his devotion. Even his life. Suddenly Frodo moved for the first time all night. Aragorn watched his head turn a little, his lips parting slightly.
