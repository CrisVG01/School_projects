Hey, Thanks for the heads up. I contacted Coin to let her know I'll be needing her in the future. I don't want to act and have my personal life on display. Or be a LGBTA spokesperson. That sounds really bad, but like the moment you come out publically they want to make you a political message and I'm firstly not a political person; secondly I don't want to be known as that lesbian actress-which is how I would be described. Also I don't want to be out publically-like socitally wise. Everyone knows I'm out. But I don't need the public to know this because of above. Enobaria says hi. Love you. ' You have reached the voice mailbox of Katniss Everdeen. Please leave a message at the sound of the beep.' 'Katniss? Hey. It's me again. Can you please call me back?' TO: QUEEN OF THE GODAMN FORREST FROM: It's Mermaid Bitch SUBJECT: Do you know how to get the smell of weed out of Jimmy Choos? Well there was an awkward hangover coffee. We went to Mellark's and it was kinda really not bad but not good. Like do normal people have coffee with their ex-fiancé? Or is that just not a thing? Like it's been three years, and we're both just friends. Like you're sleeping with him. We're obviously over it. But….Jo did I make a mistake agreeing to be friends? Like we're much better than where we were back then, but it's not. It's not the same. We're not the same people. I just… Fuck. TO: It's Mermaid Bitch FROM: QUEEN OF THE GODAMN FORREST SUBJECT: Hotbox the bathroom with incents. I knew you weren't okay with it. Jesus Fucking Christ Crazy, you should have just said no. Fuck. Okay look I'll be home from work in like…three hours. I'll bring a lot of wine and cheesecake and you can hit me or- I'll buy some second hand dishes and you can throw them off the balcony. And then you can hit me. And we can buy the banana slicer off Amazon and you can make plans to cut off Finn's dick and then cry over it because wine makes you cry. Okay, everything will be okay. I promise. TO: QUEEN OF THE GODAMN FORREST FROM: It's Mermaid Bitch SUBJECT: Can scented candles work? I'm okay. I've 10000000000% over Finnick. The cheesecake and wine are much appreciated. But you can fuck Finnick all you want. Like I am over him. We just didn't want the same things. Also everyone knows that high school relationships don't last forever, we just had a really longer than usual run. I'm going to love him but not the in-love love him. More like my oldest and dearest friend love.

And you know what that means; it's the day when Happy Hour starts at one! And I answer some of your questions and tweets! This first one is from at Rue eight, interesting name, your address in France? And she is asking, who is Miss Annie C." "Well Rue, and all of you first time viewers, Annie is my dearest, dearest friend. We went to high school together in the old days, and we've kept in touch. She doesn't really want to get involved in my videos, so I'm not going to talk a lot about her. " "The second tweet is from at Cato-nice, direct I like it- what's with the trident? So again, this channel is over ten years old, because I started it when I was fourteen way back when YouTube began to exist, and I had this huge boner for Greek Mythology-or more simply Poseidon. And so I drew tridents everywhere and I had to make a brand for YouTube-I was taking intro to business at the time-and so it became a trident. Also they're freaking cool." "And then the next tweet is from some girl named Gale Hawthorne-apparently she has a YouTube channel about video games and wild stuff and explosions, maybe you should check it out-and she's tweeted to me How's the hangover Odair? With the hashtag fucking lightweight and Miss Hawthorne, while you won't see what I'm giving you because I'm a gentleman and I blur- imagine it up your ass." "And the last tweet is from Miss Cashmere xoxo and she wants me to take off my shirt. Well…if this video gets fifty thousand likes before midnight tonight I might Instagram me shirtless." "So that's all for today, please like, favourite and subscribe to this video if you like me and want to see more of me. I have new videos every weekday, and you like that much you can find me on twitter at
