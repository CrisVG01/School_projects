****NEW STORY***** I have multiple chapters of this story written, it's almost finished actually, so I decided to take a chance and post it. This story was started years ago but was lost until just last week. Hope you guys enjoy it! ***DISCLAIMER FOR ENTIRE STORY****I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE CHARACTERS, JUST THE PLOT OF THIS STORY. WE ALL NEED TO GIVE A HUGE SHOUT-OUT TO SM FOR CREATING THESE CHARACTERS WE ALL LOVE TO PLAY WITH! ***Sorry for any confusion...like I stated earlier, this story was written years ago. Bella was in a relationship with Jake. Not Mike. Thanks to the reader that pointed out the mistake! Chapter 1 BPOV "Come on, Bella. We have to go out tonight! It's just to the movies." My best friend, Lena begged me as she bounced around on her heels. I shook my head. "I don't feel like it Lena. I'm sorry but I really don't feel like going out tonight." I told her as I sat in the corner of my couch in my pajamas. She immediately quit bouncing and sat down beside me. "It's been over a year, B, you have to get over this fear that every guy is going to do you like Jake did." She said softly. I groaned but nodded in acquiescence because I knew she was right. It has been almost 18 months since I had walked into my old apartment and caught my fiancée of two years bent over and strapped to our kitchen table with a big black guy standing behind him hollering 'How do you like me now!' as he pounded into him. I had tried for days, weeks, and months to erase that image out of my head but nothing had worked as of yet. It was forever ingrained into my brain. I remember that day as if it happened just a few hours ago. With Jake still strapped to the table I ran to the bedroom tossing a few clothes into a suitcase and grabbing all of my important stuff, quickly leaving the same way I had entered. I had moved into Lena and Brian's spare bedroom that very night which led me to the home that was now my pride and joy. Buying the run-down, dilapidated townhouse three door down from my best friend's home had filled the empty void that was left by Jake's deception and lies. Spending the next year renovating and restoring it with the money I had gotten from my first three books I had published; Grace, Fate and Destiny gave me something to focus on. I was both a client and a journalist for Volturi Publications and it worked out wonderfully because I could concentrate on my books but also take on an assignment whenever I wanted to. "I know how long it's been, Lena, but I'm just not ready." I told her miserably because I was extremely lonely but didn't know if I could trust my instincts as a woman or the intentions of a man. She huffed and reached for my computer that was sitting on the ottoman in front of her. I had been attempting to write but had gotten frustrated and pushed the computer away. "I hate to have to resort to these lengths but apparently it is needed. I signed you up for this online dating website and you have four potential guys who are very interested in you." I sat up on the couch in shock at what she had done without my consent. We had been best friends since the third grade, when I had moved in with my single father in Forks, Washington, and we even came to New York together to attend college at NYU. "I'm not interested in them, Lena." I told her as I tossed my hands up in the air. "Stop pushing, please." I begged her uselessly. She just shrugged her shoulders and slid the computer onto my lap. "It doesn't hurt to look, B. I just want you to be happy again. Don't give that slimy bastard the satisfaction of ruining your happiness." She said grabbing my TV remote commandeering my TV while leaving me to the computer now sitting in my lap. Begrudgingly, I looked over the profiles of each man just to satisfy Lena so she would get off my case for a little bit. Each one sounded better than the last and all looked too good to be true so I assumed they weren't completely honest on their questionnaires most sites required a person to answer when signing up. "Did you answer all the questions like I would have answered them or like you would want me to answer them?" I asked her as I perused the last profile again. "Unfortunately Brian walked in when I was concocting this whole plan so we both answered them like you would answer them. You can always go back and review them if you want. What do you think of the guys?" she asked as she paused the TV looking at me with a raised eyebrow. I shrugged my shoulders. "The three I have already been through sound too cliché and too good to be true." I told her as I scrolled through the profile of the last guy. He was 29, owned his own construction company, single, no kids, drank with friends on occasion, was a self-professed family man, but it was his answer to the smoking question that caught my attention. The question was 'What are your views on smoking?' and he answered it with a smart ass remark like I probably would have; why do I want to burn my lungs away when the rest of the world is doing it for me? That is what caught my attention. "I like this guy." I told Lena as I swiveled the computer around to show her the profile of Capricorn_guy12366. "He seems the most suitable out of the four." She screwed up her nose. "He doesn't have a picture, B. What if he is really a 50 year old bald guy with a bulging gut and a bitchy wife?" I just laughed and shrugged. "You are the one that pushed me to do this thing so I'm going to take a chance because I like his smart ass responses and I don't care that he doesn't have a picture." I told her before a sudden thought popped into my head. "Wait, do I have a picture?" I asked her as I clicked the 'WRITE' button on the computer to contact Capricorn_guy12366. She shook her head. "Nope, didn't figure you would want your picture out there. I just put a picture of the skyline view from your roof." "Good." I told her as I started typing the first message to Capricorn_guy12366. It was then that I realized we had similar login names. To: Capricorn_guy12366 From: Gemini198510013 Date/Time sent: Friday, January 18, 2013 5:49P.M. Dear Capricorn, I'm new to this whole online dating thing but I liked your responses and figured what the hell. I got nothing else to lose. By the way, my best friend since childhood actually signed me up for this website and just told me about it roughly an hour ago. Instead of going with the typical Yes/No/Only in social situation response to the smoking question you gave a response like I would give! That is what caught my attention. I just want to be honest from the get go, I'm not sure how good I am going to be at this or how far or how quick I will let this progress but I am willing to give it a try. I have a lot of trust issues both with myself and men but you are the first guy that has sparked an interest in over a year so I am willing to give it a shot. I know my profile probably says all of this but I will get it out of the way anyways so that you know it came from me. I am 28 years old. I live in New York City in a beautiful circa 1880's townhome that I have painstakingly refurbished and remodeled over the past year. I am both a journalist and an author for a publishing company here in the city. I am not looking for a relationship right now, merely friendship and see where that gets me. I am an only child to divorced parents. I graduated from NYU with both a literature degree and a journalism degree. I don't drink since I only drank on occasion with my best friend and she is currently three and a half months pregnant with my first niece or nephew. I don't smoke because my mother passed away a few years ago from lung cancer, she had been a smoker for 20+ years. I am originally from Washington where I had lived since I was in the third grade. For the sake of my career and propriety, I cannot give you my name right now. Maybe later down the road. Now, it's your turn. Sincerely, Gemini EPOV "Mary Alice, do you want to explain why I have an email from some matchmaking website in my personal email account?" I asked my sister as I looked at the email from a Gemini198510013 that was sent through . She just laughed through the phone. "I signed you up for it dear brother. You work too much and need to meet some nice young women and this is the only way I could think of to do it. Who is the email from?" She asked quickly. "Somebody going by Gemini198510013." I told her as I pulled up the email to see what she had to say at least. "Ooh, that one is a good one. You should see what she has to say." Alice chirped from the other end of my phone. "What did you write about why I choose not to smoke?" I asked her as I read through the email. She laughed and I could picture her twirling around her design studio in excitement. "I answered it with the same thing you always tell people. 'Why do I want to burn my lungs up when other people do it for me?'" she repeated what I had said to countless people who had asked that stupid 'get to know me' question over the years. "Well at least you got that part right." I mumbled to her as I clicked reply to the email. She had went over all the basics in her email so I didn't feel like I needed to go view her profile, I would just take the woman at her word. Since she had taken the time to email I figured I could do the same even though at the moment I couldn't reveal my name because of a business deal I was fighting to get through. "Why did you do this, Alice? This girl seems genuinely nice and I am stuck in this bullshit deal with Tanya until she signs the final documents." I ranted to her as I leaned back in my chair frustrated at what my life had become. I was in the middle of one of the biggest business deals of my entire life and it all centered around pretending to date Tanya Denali of Denali Designs, her father's architectural design company. Eleazar Denali and I had been business competitors for the past five years until he called me out of the blue three months ago asking me if I was interested in merging our businesses into one. When I scoffed at him in disbelief and asked what the catch was he said it was because he was getting old and wanted to retire but didn't want the business to fall into his daughter's greedy hands. He was afraid that she would ruin the reputation, both professional and personal, he had worked his entire adult life creating and perfecting. After a few top secret
