It sometimes wasn't always easy being the little sister to an angry hot-headed werewolf older brother, especially when he was so well respected by the Elders of our tribal community which has me constantly feeling like I was being overshadowed by my own brother. I love my brother, but it just always seems that others in our community always seem to refer to me as just being Paul Lahote's kid sister that nobody cared about as most of them couldn't even bother to learn my name as not even my damn teachers see me as anything but being Paul Lahote's little sister. This has caused me to have a lot of resentment towards my loving big brother as everyone just expects me to act just like him as I couldn't possible have a personality of my own, but nobody seems to realize is that I am nothing like my older brother and just because we are siblings and share the same blood, it doesn't mean I am going to act out just like him which is what everyone expects me to do. It makes me now hate school when I used to really love school and learning so much until teachers were constantly comparing me to my brother when we couldn't be more different and the only thing we share is our looks and teachers shouldn't have such low expectations of me just because of my older brother and I sometimes hate him for that. There are times when I just hate myself for resenting my brother as I love him more than anything, having practically raised me since I was three even when he can be an angry hot head at times as he doesn't always make it easy, but I also wouldn't change him for the world. It is just hard at times to not resent him when I am always being compared to him by everyone in our tribal community in La Push because my brother is a pillar in the community in the Elder's eyes and are always making sure that I do nothing to discredit him, claiming I don't have time to play child when I had to live up to the standards of being Paul Lahote's little sister and it wasn't fair. I was never just allowed to be Dakota Lahote, an almost nine year old little girl who loves art and rollerblading with her best friend until she drops as teachers have such low expectations of me just because of who my brother is while the Elders expect too much from me because Paul is a werewolf so I don't have time to play kid as they see it as I carry a werewolf gene. I sometimes wish I didn't carry the gene because it is just too much pressure for a kid my age to have and know that Paul would be real upset with the Elders if he knew how they treat me when he isn't around, when all that I want to do is just play like every other kid my age, besides Paul is a werewolf, not me. The only reason that the Elders even respected Paul is because of his werewolf status, despising our father for being a drunk and a bad example to our community and because we are his offspring, we are just as bad for sharing our father's blood and had done nothing to protect us as they would always look the other way when our father would beat us. They claimed that they couldn't risk reporting our father for child abuse as it could risk the pack secret and Paul had to stay in La Push in order for him to trigger the werewolf gene which I know pissed my brother off, knowing that he would rather have not triggered it as it was only a curse that ruined his life. Paul despises the Elders almost as much as me, claiming that they took his choices away from him as he had wanted a life out of La Push, taking me with him and starting a life for himself and hates them for watching while our father beat us because they cared more about their secret than protecting us from our abusive father who I technically still reside with. It has been almost three years since the pack was involved in a vampire fight and Paul imprinted on Rachel Black who I know doesn't even like me too much with the looks she will sometimes give me though I haven't really said anything to Paul as I doubt he would care or believe me. Though her dislike for me has more to do with her younger brother Jacob, also a werewolf, not liking me because his imprint and I don't get along as she was always acting like a spoiled little brat that always had to have her way with everything and throwing a tantrum when she wouldn't get her way. I know that the only reason Jacob hates me is because he is still just mad that Paul didn't stand with him in the fight against the royal vampires that had threatened his imprint, Renesmee's life and he takes it out on me because I was six and couldn't stand the thought of him leaving me, so he stayed behind to protect the imprints because of me. Though Paul had said that he would have never left me behind to fight anyway, I think my big brother was just using me as an excuse to not want to leave his precious Rachel, and wished someone would tell Jacob because he is starting to get to me and I don't think I can take his bullying much longer. There was nothing that I could really do to stop him from bullying me as Jacob was so much more bigger than me and Rachel who is supposed to be my brother's imprint, will even join in at times while their father doesn't believe they are doing anything wrong. I was only eight years old and too scared of what he would do if I was to tell someone when I just wanted to tell my brother everything but was scared he wouldn't believe me if I told him his own imprint and brother were bullying me though it didn't mean I didn't fight back against them because I wasn't Paul's sister for nothing. Jacob just blamed me for Paul not standing with him and going after me was his way at punishing my brother and the Elders know what Jake has been doing but choose to just look the other way because Jacob is next in line to become tribal leader which is why I can no longer trust them. Though Jacob is also the reason why I had stopped going over with Paul to Emily's who I loved as an older sister that I never had and my brother eventually stopped asking if I wanted to come with him when that was all that I wanted to do which was when we began drifting apart and that was probably Jacob's plan all along. I never understood why Paul had allowed Bella and Edward, mostly Bella to babysit me when I was younger when he didn't even trust them, but for some odd reason, trusted them to take care of me when he wasn't around as he didn't trust my father to care for me properly as he was nothing more than a drunk, especially when my brother knew that Renesmee and I didn't get along. Renesmee had a habit of lashing out verbally and physically when she can't get her own way as I refused to let her push me around just so she can have her way, but Paul kept leaving me to have play dates with Renesmee until she had finally lashed out at me and fractured my arm when she used her vampire strength against me. Paul was pissed at Bella and Edward for allowing their daughter to act that way and nearly phased and if it wasn't for me being hurt and Renesmee being an imprint, he would have and I haven't been allowed to have a play date with her since though will allow me to see Bella at times as long as her daughter isn't around, but mostly has the Cameron's babysit me now. As far as everyone was concerned, with the exception of Paul and Jared, Renesmee was a sweet innocent little girl who could do no harm to anyone and there was no way that she would lash out and fracture my arm, despite her father and one uncle being right there when she lashed out at me. So I obviously had to be making it up or mistaking as Renesmee wouldn't do such a thing as Jacob told them all that I was lying and that I had intentionally fractured my arm myself for attention as I had apparently gotten his precious imprint in trouble with her father because I fractured my arm. It wasn't my fault she is a brat and she got herself in trouble all on her own as I didn't tell her to lash out at me because she lost a stupid game of connect four, and was hurt with how many people who I thought were trusted friends, believed me to be lying and why I don't know who to really trust anymore. I grew up raised in La Push, the Quileute reservation that my family, mostly my grandparents and older brother, takes much pride in and where the werewolf gene comes from though my father, not so much as he takes much more pride in drinking and passing out on our living room couch than our Quileute heritage. I love our heritage as much as my brother does while my mother, also Quileute took off when I was only three, leaving Paul and I behind and now lives in California with her new husband and has two three year old twins and I haven't seen her since as Paul and my father won't let me. I never could understand why Paul had been allowed to visit our mother when he was sixteen, but I have never been allowed to do the same when I already have so very little memories of her as it is and I know that she would want to see me as much as I want to see her. Paul refused to tell me anything about his trip, wondering if something happened in California to cause him to come back so angry that had him triggering his werewolf gene and phasing into a werewolf not long after as something serious must have happened for him to come back early like that. I didn't know about Paul being a werewolf back then as I didn't find out about it until six months later, I just remember Paul disappearing for a couple weeks and suddenly was avoiding me like a plaque as Sam Uley, his Alpha told him to stay away from me until Paul managed to break the Alpha order when he realized it was doing me more harm than good. Though I understand why he avoided me, I was only six then and Paul was the only one that cared about me in our house as our father and stepmother couldn't care less about me so thought that he was abandoning me too, remembering all those nights I had cried myself to sleep because I believed he didn't love me anymore. It didn't seem fair that Paul and my father wanted me to have nothing to do with my mother and I just don't understand why as all that I have ever wanted was to meet my Mama, with having only my stepmother for any female interaction who only liked having me around so she could practice her parenting skills on me until she had my stupid half sister and didn't need to practice on
