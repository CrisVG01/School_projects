[Disclaimer]: I do not own Twilight, I simple borrow the characters for my own stories. A/N : I got sidetracked from the other story and came up with this one shot or may be a multi-chapter. Either way, go ahead and read the story. Tell me how much you loved it after you've finished. It helps me out a lot. I apologize for any misspelling and grammar, I do not have a spell check on what I use and I am far to lazy to go through this over and over.

No one knows who you are or what your favorite kind of gum is. It's a fresh start n which I choose to live life to the fullest. My father, Connor Parker, got called in for a job at a police station all the way out in a small town called Forks. When he came home that fateful night to give me the "bad news." He was flabbergasted that I would rejoice in such a way that I did. Jumping up and down, shouting yes repeatedly seemed like the ideal way to do things. I knew my father could understand why I was ecstatic about moving on to another town, leaving behind the good old memories that I have at Cougar High. I'm not going to get way into it, but to put things short, I was bullied. At my old school I was constantly bullied by the girls and some of the guys for being a little over weight. They'd make fun of everything they saw on me, and the clothing I would wear. I became self-conscious, and over the summer I took action. I hardly ate anything but salad and fruit. I went on an all vegetarian diet and things were working out great, I even got my dad to sign me up for the gym. My plan did work, but it came with some problems. I went back to school, this is when I was in the tenth grade, and wore clothing that fit. My shirt stuck to my body so I could show off the curves I've never had. I had some great positive feed back, but after a month there was a rumor that I went anorexic and threw everything up and shoot something into my body. I finally had enough of the bullying and went straight to the principles office. Screw the adults that tell us to fight our own battles, those girls were going to pay. I told my principle everything, and who the exact students were. He told me how sorry he was since his own son was in the list. I made a deal with him, if I was able to do at home study then I would take his son off the list of kids that should have been given principle was smart, he agreed and allowed this all to happen. I came home early and went right to work. I got half of my school work done, I was a pretty smart cookie. Math was easy, English was a snap and History only meant lots of reading. I like reading, but audio books have music and sometimes a voice actor, it allows your imagination to go wild when you're listening to them speak out as the character of the book. What I had forgotten about was my father. He had worked the late shifts a lot lately so we could have more mine to do things, and he also wanted to get his baby girl whatever she wanted. I never asked for anything since I was young, I always asked what my papa would want. Eventually he did find out, but my father knows better than to butt into my business too much. If he sees that I'm handling it well, then he knows that he doesn't need to intervene. Upon this new year I will be entering the 11th grade at Forks High. I couldn't wait to jump out of the SUV and run up into the bedroom of my choosing. My dad told me he got us a two-story house with an awesome backyard. My words, not his. Our new home was also conveniently around the block from his bosses, the guys name is Charlie Swan. He has a daughter named Isabella Swan, but she prefers being called Bella. The last parts of what he was speaking about are a blur, I wasn't really listening to him since all the excitement rushed to my head and all I can think about is decorating my room. "Grace, were you listening to me or thinking about the house?" My father asked tiredly from his seat. He's been driving for a whole day without any sleep. I on the other hand took a few naps here and there without even knowing I had knocked out. I drew my attention from the passenger window, turning my head lazily to face him. There was nothing but tree's and a dark, cloudy sky. It seemed like great weather for a storm of some sort. "No, I wasn't. What were you asking me?" Telling him the truth always worked out for the best. He is a cop, if I lied he would be able to tell. Also he's a parent, knowing when your kid is lying is sorta in their job description. "I wasn't asking, more like telling." He chuckled, taking a few turns down the streets that lead to our new home. "My boss Charlie, he was kind enough to get his friend Carlisle Cullen to help with our furniture. His boys pulled it all out and his wife, Esme, told them where to put it all. Charlie also told me she was able to add a woman's touch to the house, nothing to drastic, but… I know how much you like colors." I laughed from my seat, leaning my head back against the soft leather of my headrest. "Thanks dad, I didn't think about that until you mentioned it." "This year Grace, try to make some friends? I know how much you loved working at the animal shelter, but you hardly went out of the house with friends." I sighed, looking back out the window as my father drove up on to the drive way. I noticed another parked car was here, but my brain was moving a little slow. Something in the top left window caught my attention, the curtain was moving and I could see a pair of golden eyes staring right back at me. The car came to a stop. His keys rattling as he pulled them out of the ignition. Who was up there? A ghost? Wait my dad just stopped the car. That can only mean. "Oh my gosh!" I snapped alert, and got out of the SUV. I ran right into the house, my father shouting at me with a chuckle. "Don't fall young woman!" I pushed the front door open, taking my first few steps into the house I could now call mine. The smell in the house was different, it was a mix of fresh paint and the sea. I took a small glance around the first floor, but my attention is drawn to the sound of footsteps upstairs. The footsteps came to a stop. "Oh no you don't…." I murmured, racing up the steps to the second floor. I dashed down the hall to the left bedroom I had claimed as mine in my head earlier. The door was open ajar, I could hear something being moved inside. I collected myself, taking in a deep breath and pushed the door open. I stood there looking like an idiot expecting to see his older sister or brother doing something wrong. No one was in the room. It was an empty blue room with ships on the bottom of the walls painted in a lighter shade of blue. The bed was pretty big, but then again so was the room. The window was open, the wind blowing the curtains which would be the reason I saw them moving. The eyes though, are they a design on the curtain? I checked, looking on the inside of the fabric only to find it was white with a silky lace feeling to it. Hmm, this woman must really know her stuff. I looked out my window, watching my dad unpack a few of his bags from the trunk of the car, and bring them up to the front door. I smiled, leaning away from the window so I could shut the darn thing. "This is mine and I love it!" I flailed on to my bad, rolling over the cool sheets. They had the same scent of the ocean I had smelled earlier, not just that, but it mixed in with something else. Maybe an air freshener sprayed in here to give it that sea like smell since the designer did make my room that way. I loved it, I felt like I was on a ship going to whichever destination I told it to go. I sighed, slowly forcing myself to get off the comfy bed so I could help my father. I hadn't seen it before, but there was a second window to my room, this one allowed me to see into my backyard. Wow, the yard was very spacious just as my father told me. We could build his shed and maybe even a small hut a little further out in the woods just for me. It could be my getaway place if I ever needed to be by myself, surrounded by nothing but nature and a corn dog. A fast movement in the tree's caught my attention, there in the brush of the woods I could see the golden eyes. They were staring right back at me, something written in them but I'm not good at reading people unless they orally tell me what's going on. These eyes seemed lonely yet hopeful, sad but happy, relieved yet tortured. Why was this person feeling so many different kinds of emotions at once? "Grace! Come give your old man some help down here, these are your bags as well young woman." I turned my head away from the activating eyes so I could answer my father. "Sure thing papa!" I glanced back outside to the bushes, the eyes were no longer there. Some teenagers would freak out if someone was watching them from the woods, staring them down like this person was me. I didn't feel scared or threatened in any way. I felt a warmth spread through my chest, and this aching feeling to run out and hold this person close to me. I wanted nothing more than find out why they had such mixed emotions while we were staring at one another. What could have caused them to hurt so much, yet feel so happy at the same time? I closed the window, but didn't lock it. I had a weird feeling I would be seeing them again. x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x=x Everything finished. We unpacked all of our things, got our rooms together and went out shopping for food. The car that was in the driveway earlier was owned by a woman who had set up the house. My father said I just missed her when I rushed into the house. She was in the backyard gardening when I ran inside, she finished up and went to welcome us to Forks. I felt bad for not introducing myself to the woman who made my room into my secret wonderland, I wanted to ask her if she could do the same to the hut I want built-in our backyard. It could be something new while I'm here in town, school won't start for another week. "What's got you thinking so much?"
