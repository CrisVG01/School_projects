Letters (I've pretended that they found some way to bring albus dumbledore and Snape back to life somehow alright people) James Sirius Potter was in the headmistresses office... again for pulling another prank, he thought it would be funny to enchant all the suits off armour to follow all the slytherins and sing "the loser song" and he also set off dung bombs in the corrider scaring mrs norris to death jumping at filch and scratching him like hell "So" McGonagall said "So" James replied "You do realize your actions you did today Mr. Potter" "What actions?" James said, acting stupidly "Your actions off today, suits off armour, dung bombs, mrs norris, filch getting scratched to death by the cat" "I dont know what your talking about" James said trying to look innocent "I think you do know, i mean what is wrong with the potter generation, i mean honestly, you are far worser then your father and grandfather put together!" James grinned making mcgonagall to glare at him "I shall be writing your parents tonight again, since detentions seem to be doing nothing" "Which parent? Mum or dad?" "I said parents which means both of them" " Oh hopefully Dad will get the letter and hide it from Mum, since Dad doesn't really do anything" James muttered "What was that, Potter? "Nothing, nothing, nothing" James said cooly "You may now leave" James stood up and left the McGonnagall's office Proffesor McGonagall sat in her chair, dipped her quil in in and wrote Dear Mr and Mrs Potter, Your son James Sirius Potter has once again caused a disruption in the school, i've written so many letters to you that it has become a collection, he has broken the school record of trouble in his 4th year, whilst the maurders James Potter and Sirius Black in all their 7years are no where near caused the amount of trouble your son has.
