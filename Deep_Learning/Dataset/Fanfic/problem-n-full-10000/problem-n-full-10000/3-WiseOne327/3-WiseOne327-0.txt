It was Madshe. Yes, it sounds weird, I know. Blaming this whole mess on my flying sword. I get it. But it's true. If Madshe didn't want to cut the ropes so badly, this never would have happened. Well, you most likely think I'm some random crazy person. Well, I'm not. Random that is. My name is Logan Carther. I'm 16 years old, and I'm kind of a big deal deal in my world. So I guess I should tell you what really happened. It all started the day my mom died. Years before, my father left. I never knew him, but as soon as he found out I was going to be born, he left. My mom still loved him, though. Even after he left. She never said anything bad against him. I never knew why. My mom and I were sitting in our living room. She was making weird streaks on a piece of paper, absentmindedly. Instead of watching her, I was busy whacking things with my stick. I was taking plastic cups, and whacking them with a long, brown, stick. My mother never looked up from her doodles, and she looked deep in thought. So, like the idiot I am, didn't ask about the sky turning a deep red, and people materializing from thin air. My mom didn't notice until one appeared right in front of her. The weird thing? Sorry, let me restate that question. The weird thing, besides the red sky, mean looking people, and my mom not even looking up? The weird thing was when the man appeared, my mom didn't hesitate for a millisecond! She grabbed the closest thing to her; a lamp. She raised the lamp above her head, and slammed it down on the mans head. He crumpled. Then my mom turned to me./span/strong/h2 p style="margin: 0px; font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium; text-align: left;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;"span style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""Go to the painting above your bed and yank out, OK?"br /It was an odd request, but I did what she said. I ran into my room and hopped on my bed. A grabbed the paintings sides, and pulled. The painting came out with ease. Behind my spider man painting, was a small compartment. In the compartment, was a ledge. On the ledge, was a long knife, with a brown leather hilt, and a silver blade. A grabbed it and zoomed down the steps and into the living room, where my mom was waiting patently with a few bodies around the /"Are they dead?" I /"No," she answered. "Give me that!"br /She grabbed the knife away from me and went around the room stabbing the fallen men. I'm telling you, it's weird to see men disintegrating into nothing but dust. Finally, my mom looked at /"Go to your uncles house," she told me. "It's safe there. But I need to tell you something first. About your father," she /My heart stopped. She was going to tell me. For 16 years, she has been avoiding the subject. Now, I think she knows I'm ready to learn the /"Your father," she started. "Was...," she gasped and fell. A man stood behind her, taking a knife from her back. I fell to my knees in front of her. I felt for a pulse. Something that gave me a clue she was still alive. Nothing. No pulse. No heartbeat. Nothing. My mother was dead. I took the knife from her clenched hand and threw it at the man. He disintegrated. I felt sick. I ran to where he was standing and took my knife back, along with his. I went around the room, picking up the fallen men's weapons. I grabbed a backpack and quickly stuffed the weapons into it. I also added some food and 3 bottles of water. I heard a deafening boom from outside. I knew I had to leave. Now. I zipped the backpack up, and ran. I ran strait out the door. I ran faster than I ever ran before. I heard one of the men shout. I ran faster. When the booms were faint, I stopped. I looked were many houses all around me. People were looking out their windows at me, guiding their children into the house, away from me. I didn't blame them. I imagined what I looked like. Ripped clothes. Messy hair. A dirty backpack. I must have looked like a hobo. I walked further. Then, I came upon a huge house. A mansion, if you will. My uncle Randolph's home sweet home. It looked more like a creepy abandoned house to me, but, everyone has their own opinions, right. I, for one, wasn't going in their unless forced. But, I was pretty tired, and the cement didn't look too comfy, at the moment. I'm sure the floor looks nice enough on some days, but now... yeah, no. I walked up to the huge wooden door. I raised my fist to knock, and -/span/span/strong/p div style="font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium;" p style="margin: 0px;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""Nephew!" Someone bellowed. The door swung open, and a man was standing before me. He was a big man. Very big man. His muscles were visible through his green shirt. He had a dark green shirt, and... purple pants. I thought he was starting a new fashion trend, you know, the ugly things people decide to wear in public. I thought he was going to be, I don't know, normal. He had sandy hair, and a large smile. I kinda wanted to step back./span/strong/p /div div style="font-family: Tinos; font-size: medium;" p style="margin: 0px;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""Wheres your mom?

I walked past him, careful not to touch him. He looked about ready to punch someone, or hug them. I didn't want to do either. He led me upstairs, to a door on the he opened the door, he said something about this being my room. I didn't hear him all that well, because my room, was amazing. Pizza was flying around, landing on the walls, floor, and other objects. Soda cans were fizzing up and exploding in the corner. The TV was on, and two controllers were playing HALO 4. Something was jumping on the bed. I looked closer. An animal was in my room, jumping on the bed. For some reason, the story my mom used to tell me, came into my head. "12 monkeys, jumping on the bed. One fell off and bumped his head. Mommy called the doctor and the doctor said, no more monkeys, jumping on the bed," and then the monkeys kept jumping off the bed, until there were none left. The creature looked at me. Yep, I would have preferred the monkeys. The thing was hideous. I mean, really. It had a really gross shade of green for the skin. It's mouth was thin and cracked. It had no hair, but two large ear, that flopped like a dogs. His eyes. Oh yes, his eyes. They were a nasty red. So red, it felt like he was burning me with them. He had a long nose, and was very short. I mean, like, up-to-my-waist short. He looked at me in the eye's and I gasped. I fell to my knee's and felt as though I was burning alive. The pain was almost unbearable. Almost. For some reason, I wanted to laugh. So I did. I laughed, causing the fire to cease, from confusion. I don't think the thing expected it's victim to start laughing when in pain. I looked up into the thing's eye's, and saw the redness in them, dim a bit. Not a lot, but enough to let me stand again./span/strong/p p style="margin: 0px;"strongspan style="font-family: georgia, 'times new roman', serif;" data-blogger-escaped-style="font-family: , times new roman , serif;""This is Amduscas," Uncle Randolph told me.
