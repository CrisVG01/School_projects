She was practically seething as she crossed the room to find her usual spot at a table by the window with the wonderful view about the Black Lake. On the long way from dinner in the Great Hall up to the Gryffindor Tower her mood had grown worse and worse. For a Sunday evening, the common room was only moderately occupied. Her friend, Hermione, was sitting on the sofa near the fire place, giving her a worried look. "Ginny, what's going on?" she asked concernedly, "What's bothering you?" Ginny had told her friend the night before that she'd broken-up with her boyfriend Michael Corner after a heated discussion. "Merlin, why do boys always have to be such idiots? It's not been twenty-four hours since I've ditched him, and he's already hanging around in every secluded corner with bloody Cho Chang. He made a real show of it as soon as he saw me. " "Ginny, calm down," said Hermione. "Be glad that you got rid of him. You deserve someone better." "Oh, but that's not news!" interjected her nearby sitting brother, Fred. "No, your dear friend Michael has been very close with this Chang bird." added his twin, George. "For a couple of weeks now." Fred nodded in agreement. "We thought this was the reason you broke-up with that Corner bloke." "No," retorted Ginny, "the idiot didn't like that we won against Ravenclaw, and that bloody Cho Chang cried after the game. Git," she cursed. "Anyway," George noted, "maybe next time you should make a better choice." "Someone trustworthy…", added Fred. "Someone honest..." "Someone who likes to play Quidditch..." "We would volunteer to advise you…" "Dear little sister…" The boys grinned impishly. "Oh, let it be" Ginny countered. "In the end, the boys aren't worth all the trouble. At the moment, I think I just want to be left alone. Anyway, don't bother me." She growled, "Just mind your own business, if you know what is good for you." "Oh, and you can relay this message to your dear brother, too." She added with a glare at her brothers. "Ron also needs to be reminded of what exactly his business is every once a while. He's been spying on me for weeks." In the attempt to relax and calm down, she went over to the fire place and fell into the armchair next to Hermione. She let her gaze wander over the room. "Hermione, where is Ha…" she hesitated for a moment, "Where are the boys?" "Ron is in his dorm playing chess with Dean" Hermione explained, "and Harry is in detention with Umbridge." "Detention? On a Sunday evening?" Ginny enquired. "Seems Malfoy trapped him. He and his goons maltreated a Hufflepuff first year, and when Harry tried to intervene, they dragged him to Umbridge and accused him of causing trouble." "Not again," Ginny groaned "He's always so moody when he's back from that toad. We should do something to the idiots calling themselves Inquisitorial Squad." "I'm afraid, that's not possible. Umbridge is under the personal protection of the Minister of Magic. Even the professors are powerless against her." "Argh!" Ginny stood up and growled "I've had enough trouble for today, I'm going to bed." With that she was on her way to the stairs up to her dorm. Hermione, with a thoughtful gaze, considered following her to try to distract and calm her down a bit. Eventually, however, she decided otherwise, sighed and simply leaned back in her couch, comfortable with the idea to let the evening fade away with a couple of hours of light reading about the history of the house elves in Belgium. *** Ginny & Harry *** Monday Evening The next evening after dinner Ginny was sitting at her usual place at the window in the common room. Trying to complete her Charms essay, she let her gaze drift over the Black Lake. Down by the shore she had sat a few days ago, with Harry by her side. She'd had a free period, which she usually spent with Michael, who had apologized. His study group had to work on an important project in the library, as so often happened lately. With hindsight, she wondered if he just had spent some time with Cho Chang in the library. She realized, however, that she'd not missed Michael that day. She had a very nice talk with Harry, as so often in recent weeks. They discussed the upcoming Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, which Harry wasn't allowed to attend because of the Quidditch ban imposed by Umbridge. They were talking about the injustices the Inquisitorial Squad was allowed to commit on Hogwarts students in the name of Umbridge and the Ministry, and that Harry was angry at Dumbledore because he hadn't been talking to him for months. Ginny thought that it would be nice if they both had more time to talk, now that Michael was history. Since the last Christmas at Grimmauld Place, the two of them had become really good friends. After they talked about Tom Riddle and how it felt to be possessed, it seemed easy to talk about all of the minor things in life. They often talked about all sorts of things, their favourite Quidditch teams, joked about Hermione's bossiness, and Ginny's relationship to her brothers. However, over the last couple of weeks Ginny often noticed a strange look on Harry's face, mostly when he thought he was unobserved. Hmm, why must boys always be so strange? She liked to have fun with Harry. They shared funny tales about incidents in McGonagall's Transfiguration class, sarcastic remarks about Snape, Filch and Malfoy. Although Harry didn't like to talk about Malfoy, he obviously detested the Slytherin from the bottom of his heart. It was another thing they had in common. One thing, however, disheartened her. Although she often had the impression that Harry would like to talk to her about it, he avoided talking about personal matters. Real personal matters. Secretly, she hoped that one day he would open up a little more. Hmm, why boys must always be so hard to read? Harry in particular. Okay, there were some boys who were very easy to read. But she had no interest in them. She had to smile benignly about the sudden impression that lately, she could read Harry better. Except, of course, this strange look she had seen so often on his face over the last few weeks. She startled out of her thoughts when someone entered the common room through the portrait hole, laughing. Trying to concentrate on her essay she noticed that she'd forgotten her quill. She quickly scurried to her dorm to retrieve the missing writing utensil. When she came back to her place, she paused confused, wondering about a piece of parchment sitting on the table. She was quite sure that it wasn't previously there. Hesitantly she took it and read: Ginny, I need to talk to you. Can you please come to the old Transfiguration classroom on the seventh floor? I need your help. Harry 'Harry?' Ginny thought. Wondering what might be so urgent and private that Harry asked her to meet in an empty classroom, she put the parchment into her pocket and turned to the portrait hole muttering "Okay Harry, let's see what's bothering you." On her way to the portrait hole, she was interrupted… "Ginny!" She turned around to notice Dean Thomas hurrying over to her. "Ginny, do you have a moment, I have to talk to you. It's urgent." Amazed that suddenly so many boys wanted to talk to her, but also worried about what Harry wanted from her, she answered, "Oh, Dean, sorry, I'm in a hurry. Can we talk later?" "Well…sure Ginny, of course. I'll see you later." Dean tried to smile, but couldn't hide a touch of disappointment in his gaze. "Thanks Dean. See you later!" Ginny smiled back at Dean. She turned and hurried through the portrait hole to find the classroom Harry mentioned in his note. *** Ginny & Harry *** When she entered the classroom, Harry was already there, waiting for her. In the dim light of the room he sat on the teacher's desk with dangling legs, smiling at her when she entered the room. With a short movement of his wand he illuminated the room. He looked at her questioningly and said, "Hi, Ginny. What's up? What do you want to confess to me?" giving her a teasing smile. "Confess? What do you mean? You asked me to come here." They stared at each other in confusion. Harry slowly reached in his pocket and took out a piece of parchment, handed it to Ginny, and asked "Oh, uh .., and what does this mean?" Ginny skimmed through the note. Harry, Please come to the old Transfiguration classroom on the seventh floor, I have something to confess to you. Ginny Ginny looked dumbstruck, thinking about the weird situation. "Oh, Harry, that's odd. Somehow it seems that someone is making fun of us." Frowning, she handed Harry the piece of parchment that she had found in the common room, "See for yourself" Harry took the parchment and throw a glanced at it. "But why?" he asked. "Why would someone want us to meet in an abandoned classroom? What's the joke?" Ginny's eyes lit up, hearing the word joke made her recognize the situation. "The Twins! Ooh, I'll get them for this! Just you wait!" "What's about the Twins?" Harry asked curiously. "Yesterday evening," Ginny explained, "they proudly announced that they want to set me up with someone! I told them to mind their own business, but obviously they couldn't resist", she said with an evil grin. "How...? What...? Set you up? Sorry, I don't understand. I thought you were with Michael?" "Oh, Harry. As clueless as ever. I broke-up with Michael, I ditched him. It's over. Thank Merlin." "Oh!" was all Harry could say. "What happened?" he added after a moment. "Oh, it wasn't going so well for a while now. The git told me again and again that Quidditch isn't a sport for girls. The icing on the cake was when we won against Ravenclaw. He couldn't stand it. Funnily enough, he's already snogging the next Quidditch player. Spineless idiot!" Ginny grumbled. "Oh...How...Who's he snogging now?" he asked with an indifferent look. "Oh Potter, really. Where have you been hiding? Who do you think our pretty Cho Chang is sweet on at the moment? I bet she and her beloved Michael are just trying to fit in every empty broom cupboard of Hogwarts! Oh sorry, Harry." She stopped abruptly. After a moment of silence she added, "Harry, doesn't it hurt you? I mean what Cho is doing to you?" "Cho? Why?" he hesitated bewildered. "No, it's over between Cho and me, for a couple of weeks now. To tell the truth, I think that there wasn't ever really anything. I don't know. In the end it was always only awkward." 'It's strange,' Ginny thought to herself, 'we've been talking about almost everything in the world since last Christmas, but Cho and Michael have never been a subject. Probably Harry avoided the subject of Michael just as much as I'd avoided the subject of Cho. ' "So, and what do we do now?" asked Ginny interrupting the silence. "Uh... what do you mean, Ginny?" "We can't let Fred and George get away with
