Archer Gareninline 19, District 4 Victor of the 100th Hunger games "So Archer what do you have to say to your lovely fans from the Capitol and districts" The annoying interviewdr Cassius asks me "Fuck you Capitol and districts, ha I just kill your tributes, I wish I can stab all your children in the eye with a knife" I say laughing It's not my fault I'm spiteful but when the captiol kidnap you then throw you in the arena saying you have been chosen to be in the games without even giving you a for-warning or letting you know who the other tributes are your a little angry, me, well I just tortured any tribute I got my hands on, using knives, hands, rocks, my teeth, what a thrill, the way I killed some of them were even more memorable Cassius laughs thinking I'm joking and I cross my arms, they think my actions in the game were a act, let them think that, it's worse enough my mentor and the other victors look at me like I'm some furious monster that needs to be caged, I'm the worse Victor to date killing wise and I have seen a lot of disturbing stuff "Oh archer always the comedian, now your games were a year ago what did you feel on this day" He says "Well Mr prissy, I couldn't really feel anything since I was kidnapped from my home but remember when I forced a boy to dig his own eyes out with his hands or when I literally ripped a fellow career girls throat out with my teeth, that made me feel fantastic" I say "You were a hit with the ladies weren't you, it was a shame you killed two that fell for you" He says Oh yes the two other annoying career girls, the first person I found was the two girl the one who actually came second and whose throat I ripped out and I actually tortured just with my teeth but then we found the rest and since the tributes were pretty scattered it was hard but any tribute I came across I brutually killed them while 3 of my allies watched with shock and disgust, but the two other girls the ones from 1 and 4 were so easy to muniplate and well threw them selves at me, let's say I killed them both in brutal ways I won't share I then killed the boys from 1 and 4 even worse and left the girl from 2 since I thought she would get herself killed as she was a rebel against the districts and this was in day 3, 12 kills and I won, it was quite easy "You have to use your brain to win" I say "Well your Certainly up there with the top victors even after the assassination on our poor victors before the 65th hunger games" He says Oh yes, they call it the night of the fallen victors, apparently they all got killed at a party, but only a idiot will believe the districts did it they actually put the blame on district 13 when it was obviously the Capitol who did it just to be evil bastards so we started off new and the districts had to go without a mentor until they got a victor ofcourse district two got one off the bat but it's hard to hate that district all the victors except for that girl were entertaining in their own way plus we got a victor straight after, if I bring one home then we will equal them on the victor count "Who do you think is the best victor and District" I say crossing my arms "Aedan of course he got 14 kills no one can beat that, I love District one they have so much passion" He says I start laughing "Aedan only got 14 kills because the coward poisoned the water supply, even that annoying kid he mentored who was reaped did better in my opinion, now let me give you a downlow of each district and victors, 1 only has two pathetic, every district apart from then, 9, 11 and 12 have below 3, let's start with 2, Kyden brought the ball rolling the arena killed more then half the tributes and he was the only one who killed, Aryan, Rowan and Raiden are the perfect imagine of the insane 2 boy that comes out covered head to toe in blood, Callen has to be the smartest tribute who won, the tributes were the puppets he was the puppet master" I say Cassius nods letting me talk more, idiot "District 2 has 6, in the past 10 years if they didnt win one of their tributes come second like in my year for example, that shows district 2 is the best district victor wise and I can't disagree all of them apart from Abigail shows true blood lust something I love" "I do love Raiden" He says "Who doesn't, that boy was a lot like me expect he didn't use his teeth and he got one less kill sadly he is trying to be a good guy to impress his little sister who the captiol won't let me kill but enough on my undying bloodlust, District 3 had three victors all young, yeah they were weak victors but two used traps and 1 ran around with a knife accidentally stabbing tributes until they are unrecog my district is better then one, I'm better then Aedan and never say otherwise, District 5 again young, don't ask me how a 12 year old girl won that year was a fluke the little thing didn't even get a kill, Hollis well he killed 6 careers with his bare hands, you can't insult that kid, yes a clown told him too but still" I say "You so smart Archer" He says I roll my eyes opening my mouth once more "District 6, Holden was that insane guy that was screaming at everyone to not get hit by the train then stabbed tributes in the face with a screwdriver, his probably the craziest mentor since he has no concept of reality, Cia poor girl had a crazy district partner woke up and he was slowly carving into her with a knife, she finally stop crying like a baby and realised she had a knife and stabbed him in the stomach to win and Corin that boy has my respect, he killed his sister and I hate family, District 7 Brodie and Lisya weak kids that somehow killed now are bestfirends throw them into a arena with me and they will be dead within seconds, Eris has my respect 9 kills, 9 slow kills, don't know why he did it but I dont care for the details he still did it" I say "I really wish I was a female, you are to die for" He says touching my shoulder I step back "Don't touch me, you creep, now District 8 Kasey for the last 20 years before his games, careers were never killed by a outer tribute either another career, won or the arena, he had his eyes set on the careers and he really brought the confidence away and hatred out and he killed them slowly, sadly the career districts didn't like that and from then on the careers mainly the boys since the girl never really liked Killing for Personal reasons, tortured his tributes then cute little Cara came along and poor girl had 3 insane boys that had become a trend, they took her as hostage day 1 and was slowly mentally and physically hurting her each day, she tried to run and hide but they kept finding her, one night she did the unimaginable and found the strengths to fight back accidentally pushing all three of them down a hole, then Isaac like where the hell did he come from 10 fucking kills, yes he did just repeatedly stabbed them with his sword but he was covered in more blood then I was, love that kid" I say "Your funny too archer" he says I scowl, his about 10 years older than me and should seriously look at a girl his age, sickening "Now district 9, not much to say Myren did kill and 4 but his kills were quick apart from the girl from one, when she killed his allie he just went ballistic and stabbed her in the stomach then he just waited with her until she died going on about how careers don't win and insulting her, didn't mind him that was a merciless thing to do, the other girl yeah okay not really impressive I don't like stabs to the heart they are to quick, district 10 they have four victors that enough shown that they are a force, their tributes both genders are normally strong and determined, Ruben was from a poor area so he wasn't, he still somehow killed the girl from four which was the most ruthless female I have seen after her they haven't been as bad as the boys but anyways he was that good, then Mitchel, he wasn't all there he said that they told him to butcher his victims which he did and it was a little gruesome to watch but I don't know who told him, Lina well the one good thing she did was allie with by her district partner, he carried her through the games then when he had a knife to her neck she started crying and he ended up stabbing him self weak, although I did stab myself in the games because I was curious of the taste of my blood but anyways, Ryder typical 10 boy stupid and strong the other two districts I don't want to waste my time so I hope you understand that your wrong I'm right" I say "Wow Archer and here I thought you were just a pretty face, your mentoring for your first time this year, how will you and your fellow mentor decide who is choosing who and how will you mentor them" he asks "Well sadly I have my mentor Kelsey she was fun to play with before the games but when she realised what a phsyco I was she didn't help me, our district apperantly had a system, to stop biasim, The first Victor Lukas had both but then when Jayden came he had the boys and Jayden had the girls, every year no matter who gets reaped or volunteered, then after Kelsey won, Jayden kept the girls and she had th boys, now that I'm here we are meant to follow that so I have the girls but they are scared of me, I screamed at Kelsey in the games to sponsor me a better knife and she did it quickly, so I will have someone who I think is ruthless and ready to win and if neither are I will give it to Jayden, if I do have a good tribute I will tell them to get into the careers well I won't tell you what I will tell them, but I will ask them to kill District 2 Since we should be in lead of the victor tally" I say "I'm excited" he says "Now mr prissy I have a question for you" I ask "Yes Archer I will go out on a date with you" he says "Not that" I hiss "Im just kidding but If it's fashion advice your perfect as it is, I love the bad boy look you got and how your stylist died red streaks in your hair after you won it makes you look vicious" He says "I stabbed them in the eye with scissors, but it looks like blood so I can put up with it" I say, I was angry when they changed my look they wanted to dye my hair black, This was
