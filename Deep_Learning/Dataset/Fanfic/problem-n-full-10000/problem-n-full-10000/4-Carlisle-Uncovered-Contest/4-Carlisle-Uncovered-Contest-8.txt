Title: Saving Her Summary: She's alone in the world, and everything is going wrong. All he wants to do is help her. Pairing: CarlislexBella Rating: M Word count: 4,289 Prologue: "Why Carlisle? Why do you just happen to always be right there when I need you? Are you some sort of creeper? You got a thing for young girls?" "Its just...I'm not a pervert, okay? I just see you, and you are just so pretty, and I just want to help you." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Dr. Carlisle Cullen ran his hand down his face. The exhaustion of another long shift in the ER starting to set in. He grabbed the last chart from the triage nurse. The ER had been insanely busy for a Tuesday afternoon, but things finally slowed down. Glancing down at the name on the chart, he let out a groan. Bella Swan, cock tease extraordinaire. It's not that she meant to be. No, in fact she was pure as the driven snow, and sweet as apple pie, all of which appealed to Dr. Cullen immensely. Too bad she was more than twenty years his junior, and best friends with his daughter. Taking a deep breath, he plastered a smile on his face and pulled back the curtain. The smile immediately fell when his eyes landed on the brunette beauty. Tear tracks stained her ruddy cheeks, and her small frame shuddered from her repressed sobs. His heart broke at the sight. "Bella, sweetheart, what happened?" "I...Edward broke up with me, and I," she let out a small sob "I know I shouldn't have been driving when I was so upset, but I was stupid and now she's gone..." "Who's gone?" He asked in a panic, thinking Alice must have been with her. Those two were thick as thieves. "My truck, Bertha. She...she was the last thing I have of Charlie," she choked out. Carlisle's heart broke for the young woman. She was barely 18 when her father died, and this last year had been rough on her. He decided right then and there, he was going to do right by this girl. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Bella woke up stiff and sore on Wednesday morning. Her heart was broken, but she found it hurt more for the loss of her beloved truck, than id did over her now ex-boyfriend. Slowly, she made her way through her morning routine, dreading the fact that she no longer had a ride to work. Looking out the window at the splashes of rain, she sighed. Great, just great, she thought. She grabbed her raincoat and rubber boots and headed out. A mile down the road, Bella was soaked, despite her rain gear. She shivered as she looked at her watch. There was no way she was going to make it to the Diner in time for her shift. As she was about to pull out her phone to call in to work, a familiar car pulled up beside her. "Hey Sweetheart, need a ride?" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The car was warm inside, and the seat heater on the passenger side was already warmed. He knew Bella would need a ride to work, but he didn't think she would leave so early. He had called the diner, under the pretense of needing her schedule so he could plan a surprise for his daughter. No one questioned the towns trusted doctor. He glanced over at the mass of wet curls shielding the gorgeous girl from his. He was glad she trusted him. He just hoped she never figured out how he felt about her. He drove slowly to the diner, savoring every minute in her quiet presence. "Bella, sweetheart, you really shouldn't be walking in this weather. You could get hurt, or sick." She simply nodded in reply, before unbuckling her belt and stepping out. He hung his head. I'm such an idiot, he thought. Of course she didn't have another choice. "Carlisle?" Her sweet voice had him lifting his head, "Thank you," she whispered before darting into the building. Hearing his name on her pouty lips had him flying for the rest of the day. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The unfamiliar car sat sparking in her driveway. The sun that finally broke through the clouds danced off the shiny silver paint. Other than Alice, no one ever visited Bella. She couldn't imagine who it could be. As she walked up the drive she noticed no driver in the car. Continuing to her door, she saw a note taped upon it. Dear Bella, Sweetheart, I was such a fool for lecturing you this morning. I know you feel like you have no one to turn when you need help, but I want you to know you always have me. As you know, Esme took many things from me in the divorce, but one thing she left is her old car. I don't need it, and it's just sitting around collecting dust, so I would like you to drive it. Yours, Always, Carlisle ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ It took a lot of convincing on his part, but Bella finally agreed to use the Volvo. He insisted she was doing him a favor, keeping it in running order. Eventually, she gave in. He enjoyed every moment of hearing her soft voice on the phone. He imagined what it would be like to wake up to that voice in the morning. He groaned at the thought. As much as he tried to keep his feelings for her innocent, it was getting harder and harder. And so was his cock. He closed his eyes, as he reached down and stoked his cock. He pictured her pretty little lips parted softly, as her big doe eyes blinked up at him. He moaned at the thought of her down on her knees. She would show him how grateful she was. He continued to pleasure himself with thoughts of the 19-year-old-beauty, feeling his balls tighten, he stroked himself till his bare chest was covered in spunk. He felt guilty, but more than that he felt an aching need. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Working at the diner had never been Bella's goal in life, but then again she never saw her life turning out the way it had. She thought she would go off to college, get a good job, meet a wonderful man, and settle down and have a family. More than anything she wanted a family. Growing up, all she ever had was Charlie. While he was a good man, he was often distant. He was married to his job, and left her to her own devices much of the time. She was incredibly lonely, until the bright and bubbly Alice Cullen had moved to Forks their freshman year of high school. Suddenly she had a best friend, and occasionally she got to be part of a family. Esme Cullen wasn't the best mom, but she was the only mom Bella ever knew, so she adored her. When she left Carlisle for her boss, she was just as devastated as Carlisle and Alice were. When Charlie died a week after her graduation, so did her dreams. She had planned to go off to college with Alice to make all her dreams a reality, but she could no longer afford the luxury. She was drowning in the debt that Charlie left behind, and was struggling to make ends meet. The diner was the only place in town hiring, so she tied on an apron and a smile each day, and worked her hardest just to get by. Unfortunately, she suffered the misery of her coworkers. Lauren and Jessica, the high school mean girls, were still at catty as ever. They often berated her about her appearance, tripped her whenever they could, and frequently stole her tips. The bright spot of her day was her boss, Edward Masen. He was handsome, with auburn hair and a killer smile. He flirted with her outrageously always complimenting her and brushing against her. They fell quickly into a relationship. For once, she was happy. She thought she was in love. That was until he walked into his office on her day off, hoping to surprise him. Surprise him, she did, as he was balls deep in Lauren's mouth. Since then, working at the diner had been absolute hell. Lauren did her best to rub it in that Bella had lost Edward to her. Edward became harsh and critical of everything Bella did. Nothing she could do was good enough. The tables weren't clean enough, the orders weren't delivered fast enough, she wasn't friendly enough to the customers, or she was too friendly for his liking. She knew he wanted her to leave, but she had no other place to go. At least there was one bright spot in her day. Alice's dad, Carlisle, had taken to visiting each day at lunch. Seeing his smiling face always made her feel less alone. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The smile fell from Carlisle's lips as Bella turned away to fetch his coffee. He could hear the other waitresses' nasty remarks about his sweet girl. It was the same every day. Alice had confided in him that Bella was being given a hard time, and begged him to keep an eye on her while she was away at school. Carlisle had jumped at the chance to see Bella more often. The sound of glass breaking and shouting coming from the kitchen had Carlisle on his feet. Pushing the swinging door open a few inches, he saw his sweet girl huddled on the floor, picking up pieces of the broken mug, while Edward Masen stood over her, screaming. "You stupid bitch! Why are you so fucking clumsy? I don't pay you to break all my shit!" "I'm s-s-s-orry Edward," she stuttered, "You just caught me off guard when you touched me." "You never seemed to have a problem with it before. Is that your problem? You can't deal with me not touching you? Are you jealous of what Lauren and I have? She's not a frigid little bitch like you." A tear ran down Bella's cheek as she ducked her head and mopped up the spilled coffee. "ENOUGH!" Carlish roared. "You have no right to treat her that way! Bella, come here sweetheart. We're leaving." He reached out to help her to her feet. "Fine, LEAVE!" Edward shouted, "And don't even bother coming back. We don't need worthless cunts like you here anyway." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "What am I going to do?" Bella sobbed. Carlisle had driven her home, only to find a foreclosure noticed attached to the front door. Her breathing was starting to come in short pants and spots were clouding her vision. "Calm down sweetheart, it's going to be okay." "How can you say that? I have no job, and soon I'm going to have no house? What am I going to do?" "Simple, you can move in with me. You know I have large house, and with Alice away in college, it's just me. It would be nice to have some company." "I couldn't do that Carlisle. I couldn't take advantage of you." "Nonsense. I won't take no for an answer. Let's get you packed." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cxb~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Bella had been living with Carlisle for a month now, and it was heaven and hell. He loved seeing her beautiful face every morning, talking about their days over dinner, and snuggling on the couch to watch movies. But he always wanted to pull her closer, feel her skin on his, kiss her sweet lips and love her like a man. His dick was raw for as often as he found himself tugging on it. His water bill had never been so high, and it wasn't due to his houseguest. Or maybe it was. Afterall, it was her fault he had to take two showers a day. Carlisle was also pleasantly surprised to find that Bella was an avid cook. Her skills far surpassed that of his ex-wife. Sitting down to a home cooked meal with a beautiful girl each
