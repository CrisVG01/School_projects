All character but Elenya belong to Tolkien! ************************************************************************************************************************************ Dear Elenya, I am fine. I am sorry I have been gone so long. I hope everything is well at the palace. I am sending a box of herbs and spices that you can sneak into Ada's food. Hope you are well. -Legolas Elenya sighed as she set the letter aside to look at the small wooden box that had accompanied it. It was a small box, only big enough for the small bundles of plants that lay inside. She smiled when she realized what plants he had sent. For so long it had bothered them how Thranduil would stay up days on end to finish his work, and nothing short of drugging him would convince him otherwise. The worst part was that he had grown to recognize every sleeping herb that could be grown in their area, effectively foiling any and all of their plans to help. Now he had sent back just the plant she needed. A rare sleeping herb, strong and almost unrecognizable even to those used to it. Thranduil would never see it coming. And it couldn't have come sooner. He had been up for almost a week now, plagued by work and his worry for his son. Quickly she stood, grabbing her book of herbs and quickly checked how much she would need to use before taking what she needed and hiding the box. It would be no use to her if he found it and took it away. Then she hurried down to the kitchen, smiling and nodding casually as she was greeted upon entering the kitchen. She quickly pulled together a light dinner of thick soup and potent wine. He had eaten little so she did not bother to grab anything more. With a nod of thanks to her friends among the staff she strode out. Once she was out of sight she pulled the herb from her pocket, crushing it in hand and mixing half in the soup and half in the wine. Both dissolved quickly, leaving only the faintest haze in the wine. She smiled and continued on towards the study. She stopped before the door, quickly schooling her expression and wiping her hands on her dress so no trace of the herb remained. Then she put on a kind smile and knocked. "Enter", She carefully opened the door, easily balancing the tray. Thranduil sat at his desk, paperwork covering the polished wood surface. Ink stained his hands and even smeared across one cheek. His eyes held a slight glazed look along with the pink tint of being blood shot. Even his hair, usually thought impossible to be mussed, held a good tangle or two. No wonder he had forbid anyone but her to come up. "Good evening Ada", she said softly, setting the tray on a small table and moving to his side, "I brought you dinner." He gave her a soft smile, brushing one stained hand through his hair to push it out of his eyes. She winced as black streaks remained behind. "Thank you", He said softly, "I will just finish this and-" Elenya stopped him with a shake of her head. She took the pen from his hands, setting it aside and pulling him up with a strong grip on his arm. "No Ada, you need to eat, especially if I can not convince you to sleep", she said softly, tone leaving no room for argument. He sighed, giving her a more diluted version of his usual glare. Finally he caved when her look turned pleading. "Alright, I will eat, but then I need to finish", he said, she only nodded, staying close to make sure he did not fall. Thankfully he made it to the chair without incident. She settled the tray in his lap before sitting on the floor by his knee. A new tradition they had made as they sat worrying for Legolas. It had brought them both comfort to stay close together. "I got a letter from Legolas today", she said, wanting to make sure he did not notice any kind of difference in the taste. His eyes lit up as he too a drink of wine. "Really? And what did he have to say?" He asked, beginning on the soup. "Just that he is sorry he has been away so long and that he hopes we are well. No word yet on when he intends to return home", she said sadly. He nodded, again brushing his hair back. She smiled and stood, moving around him. She began to braid his hair, pulling it back and out of his face. His hand caught hers for a moment, giving it a squeeze of thanks. She smiled and continued, finishing just as he finished eating. She took the tray and set it aside, stopping him when he went to stand. "Sit with me for a little while?" She asked softly, eyes pleading. Thranduil nodded, knowing how the letters made her worry. She returned to her seat on the floor, leaning back against his knee. One large hand rested on her head, softly combing through it. She closed her eyes, counting to thirty. His hand had stilled by twenty five. She grinned and stood, seeing that he was well and truly asleep. With strength many would no believe she had she pulled him up and half carried half dragged him across the hall to his room. She settled him on the bed with a huff. She deftly removed his boots and outer robe before moving to the bathing chamber and grabbing a wet cloth to clean away the ink. Once that was done she pulled the blanket over him and kissed him on the head. "Losto Vae Ada", she whispered before quietly leaving. Once the candles had been put out and the dishes returned to the kitchen she returned to her room. She once again settled at her desk, parchment and ink before her. Dear Legolas, I am glad you are well and I hope you will return to us soon. The palace is fine, still standing if anything. We both worry after you of course. And thank you for the herbs, already they have come in handy. He never noticed a thing. Hope to hear from you soon. -Elenya Over the next few months Thranduil found himself drugged time and again. It had infuriated him to know she had that advantage. He knew it had to have been Legolas to send her some knew herb he had not been aware of, but his problem was avoiding it. He could neither recognize it nor see it and he trusted only Elenya not to poison him in this time of darkness. At one point he had even tried demanding she hand over her supply, but she had simply played innocent, denying anything about the herbs. Now he finally had his chance. Elenya had taken the day to spend time with her Nana out in the gardens, an activity she never spent less then a few hours in. This gave him the chance to go look for those blasted herbs she was hiding. He slipped into her room and shut the door tightly behind him. Then he turned, looking around and trying to figure out just where she would hide them. They would, of course, have their own box. She was to much of a professional with herbs to just leave them sitting out. Or maybe in a bag? No, they might get crushed. He hummed and moved first to her desk. Nothing. He glanced around again. Maybe they were in plain sight? She was witty enough to do it. Another minor victory over him when they were right in plain sight as he tried to talk them from her. But there were no boxes laying about. Maybe he was over thinking this. He stopped. Where would he hide them? His eyes flashed open, of course. He knelt down and peered under the bed. Sure enough a small box rest in the shadows. He slid it out and opened it, smiling at the plants that lay inside. He was about to secret them into his robes when he stopped. "She would notice, and what would happen then? His blasted son would probably only send more and she would be sure to hide them well. He frowned, again glancing down at the small box in his hand. Then he got an idea. With deft fingers he set the box on the desk and opened it. He pulled out a good amount of the sleeping herb, carefully replacing the rest to look like it had been untouched. He closed the box and wiped the rest from the desk, leaving no trace behind. He slid the plants into his pocket before returning the box to its spot. If she was going to play this game, he could at least return fire. Maybe this way she might learn a thing or two about pulling one over on him. And it was not like she was all that much better then him at times. He would just have to bid his time. once everything was just as he had found it he slipped out once more. He grinned as he moved towards his study. This was bound to be fun. It was only a week later he had the perfect chance. A new letter had come from his son, and this time with the news they had been hoping for. The war was over, and he was safe in Minas Tirith. Elenya had immediately been ready to ride out, but Thranduil had forbid it. She would not go without him, and he could not yet leave. Still the shadows lingered. It had become a huge fight that resulted in yelled words and slammed doors. After that she had only gotten worse. She had known he was right, but the thought that he was so close and yet so far from her chaffed, keeping her up at night. A few times Thranduil had tried to be reasonable. Had tried to convince her to rest, but she had refused. Finally, after a solid week of no sleep, he resorted to his plan. It was late on the eight night and he had pulled out a treat, not an uncommon thing during times such as this. Along with the chocolaty cake he had made her a large glass of milk and himself a glass of wine. Of course, the milk and cake held the herbs. Tonight he would skip the dessert, leaving it all to her. An advantage she could never pass up. He silently entered the study where she sat waiting for him, as she had done for the past week. He set the tray down without a word, smirking when her eyes followed the trays every move. "Yes child, it is for you, in the hopes a midnight snack will calm you enough to help you sleep", They both shared a knowing look. No, the snack would do no good, but he had tried. The moment he had his wine in hand she practically attacked the tray. The cake itself was a treat, one reserved only for hard nights such as these. She had stuffed half the cake into her mouth, without any thought to manners of course, before downing half the glass of milk. He watched her with an almost disgusted look. How could an elf, one as sweet and proper as his daughter-in-law, have worse manners then a dwarf? Then again, she was always the perfect princess in front of any but him. She trusted him enough to let go in his presence. So maybe he should count
