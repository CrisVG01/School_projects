A.N.: Hey guys, what's up? So I've decided to delete the other Harry Potter story and rewrite it. I didn't really like the beginning of it so much, and wanted to focus more on life for Harry while he was at home. I hope you guys like the new version. So, feel free to leave a Review, send a PM, and of course, enjoy. Until next time, OPKILLERFROST, out. Harry woke up staring at the ceiling of his room at Number Four, Privet Drive. Well, room was a bit of an overstatement. The place that Harry had called a room for the past ten years and eleven months of his miserable life was nothing but a cupboard under the stairs. It was barely large enough for him to stand straight. As he stood up, he heard his cousin, Dudley, pounding down the steps above Harry. As Harry began to leave his "room", his cousin ran by, punching Harry in the stomach, then pushing him back into the cupboard. Harry felt like throwing up after that punch, but there was nothing in his stomach to throw up. He had gone to bed yet again with no dinner, and the Dursleys had not lost a wink of sleep over it. In fact, they had probably slept better knowing that Harry was suffering. Once the pain in Harry's gut subsided, he continued to the kitchen and began to make breakfast, just as he did every morning. While cooking, his Aunt hovered over him, smacking him in the head with a wooden spoon every time he made even a miniscule mistake. "You've cooked the egg too long before flipping it!; You didn't cook the bacon long enough!; You're doing it all wrong, are you trying to poison my poor Duddy-kins?" Once breakfast was finished, Harry started to go back to his cupboard before his Aunt stopped him. He was told to start cleaning the house, because Dudley's friends were coming over. Great, Harry thought Now I have to clean, and then I get the crap beaten out of me once Dudley's gang shows up. Perfect, just perfect. This was not how Harry wanted to spend this day, but he had no choice. He continued to clean the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, Dudley's room (do not even get Harry started on how much of a pig his cousin was), his Aunt and Uncle's room, and that was not even the end of it. He had to go outside, weed the garden, prune the bushes, and then he would finally be allowed into his cupboard. By the time that Harry had finished all these chores, his body was sore. He collapsed onto his bed and had just closed his eyes when his door was wrenched open and hands were grabbing at any part of Harry's body they could find. "Quick, grab him!" He heard Dudley say He was dragged through the now-empty kitchen and out into the back yard where he was held up by two of Dudley's friends. Harry looked up to his cousin with fear in his eyes as his cousin balled up his fist and punched Harry in the face, hard. Harry could already feel the area around his left eye begin to swell as the frames of his glasses slammed into his face. He looked up just in time to receive another blow, this time to the nose. Harry felt a warm liquid running down his face, but he was unable to stop it. Harry looked up once more and felt another punch land in his stomach. At this, he slumped so much that Dudley's friends just dropped Harry onto the ground, then proceeded to stomp and kick Harry. When they grew bored of this, they scampered off inside, leaving Harry tired and bleeding the backyard. He had long ago fallen unconscious from the pain, and he would not wake up until well after midnight when his Aunt had come out and started to hit him with the spoon telling him to get inside and clean up after Dudley and his friends. Harry slowly picked himself up off of the ground and proceeded inside, where there was a mess all over the living room. There were cups and plates, and garbage and soda bottles, it was an absolute pig sty. And he had to clean all of it up. Harry began to bring all the dirty dishes into the kitchen and gingerly placed them in the sink. He then doubled back and began to clean up every single piece of garbage that Dudley and his friends had left behind. Whenever his Aunt deemed his movements too slow, Harry would receive a smack in the back with the spoon. This happened a lot because of how sore Harry's ribs were. Once the garbage was picked up, Petunia Dursley forced Harry to was the dishes that had been used that night. It was well past three in the morning before Harry was allowed to finally go to his "room" and fall asleep for the night. Little did Harry know, his life at Privet Drive was going to change very, very soon. /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ Five weeks had passed since it had been Dudley's birthday, and strange things had been happening around the residence of Number 4, Privet Drive. Strange things, indeed. Harry had been moved out of the cupboard under the stairs after a letter had arrived for him. It had been clearly addressed to him, even stating where he was sleeping in the Dursley's house. After this, Harry had been moved into Dudley's extra bedroom. This was all because of the fact that the letter had scared his Aunt and Uncle for some reason. But, hey, Harry was not going to complain. He now had an actual room to live in, not just some cupboard under the stairs. Unfortunately, his stay had not lasted long. His Uncle had forced the family to a small hut on a rock in the middle of the sea. There, a rather large man appeared and told Harry that he was a wizard. He was a wizard, and he had no idea. Although, it did explain a lot about things that had happened all throughout Harry's life. Times when he had somehow managed to get away from Dudley's gang whenever he was being chased, how bruises and broken bones managed to heal themselves overnight, or whenever he would get a haircut, but his Aunt would leave his bangs to hide his scar, his hair would grow back to its old length overnight. But Harry knew, if he went to this school, it could make Harry's life a lot better. So Harry went with Hagrid, the large man that had just saved Harry, to Diagon Alley. There, Harry learned that his parents had left him a small fortune. Using this, Harry bought everything he would need for a year at Hogwarts. It was quite the adventure. He needed things from schoolbooks to things like gloves made from dragon skin. When Harry was getting his school books, he picked up some extra books to learn about the wizarding world. Now all Harry needed was a wand. When he stepped inside Ollivander's, Harry noticed that there were thousands upon thousands of wands stacked up as high as the ceiling and as far back as the shop could go. But the thing that would leave an impression in Harry's mind for years was the owner of the shop itself, Mr. Ollivander. Mr. Ollivander proceeded to measure all sorts of parts on Harry's body, then they continued to try out dozens of wands before Harry finally found the right one. Then Harry learned something about his wand that he wished he had not. "I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather- just one other. It is very curious inded that you should be destined for this wand when its brother- why, its brother gave you that scar." After that, Harry had not felt like talking much. Instead, he just stayed silent all the way to the train station until Hagrid told him that he had to leave. At this, Hagrid left Harry alone in the train station, one moment there, the next, gone. Harry was very confused at that, because Hagrid was a really large person, almost four feet taller than the average person, and at least three times as wide. How he had managed to disappear was beyond Harry. So without someone to watch over Harry, he made his way through the train station and got on a train heading for Little Whinging. /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ Harry's last month at the Dursley's were better in many ways, but they were also worse. While he was not forced to stay in the cupboard under the stairs, he his relatives had forced him to do every excruciating chore they could think of. But they had told him through notes. They had never uttered a single word to him for the entire month that he was there. While it was nice to not be yelled at, it grew very depressing to have nobody to talk to, even if those words were full of animosity and hate. But Harry got through it all. He made it through the month and even managed to get his Uncle to drive him to Kings Cross Station on the morning of September 1st. When he got there, he had just enough time to unload his trunk and Hedwig from the car before his Uncle sped off, leaving Harry to find Platform Nine and Three-Quarters all on his own. Harry managed to find his way to the barrier between Platform Nine and Platform Ten, but beyond that, Harry had no idea where he was going. That was, until a girl with a lot of bushy brown hair and large front teeth found him. "Hello! Are you trying to get to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?" She asked "Yes." Harry said quietly "Follow me, I know how to get there." Following behind the girl, he saw he walk right into the barrier, then disappear. Harry followed her, and when he got on the other side, he saw a lot of strangely dressed people all crowded around the platform next to a large scarlet steam engine. Not knowing what to do, Harry just followed the bushy haired girl and her parents, who appeared to be muggles. When they found an empty compartment, they helped each other load their trunks into it. Harry sat down while the girl said goodbye to her parents. After a couple minutes, the train's whistle sounded. The girl came back into the compartment and sat down across from Harry. "Excuse me, but I don't think that you gave me your name. I'm Hermione Granger." She said "Oh! I'm Harry, Harry Potter." At this, Hermione gasped. She looked at his forehead and her eyes widened a little bit. It made Harry a bit uncomfortable, and he started to squirm a little in his seat. Thankfully Hermione caught on to this and stopped staring. "Oh my, I'm sorry. It's rude to stare. It's just that, I've read so much about you!" "R- read about me?" Harry asked "Yes! You're in so many of the books that I bought for extra reading! You're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century !" "Am I?" "You mean you don't know? I'd have thought that you would've known all this being one of the most famous wizards of this age." "I- I only learned I was
