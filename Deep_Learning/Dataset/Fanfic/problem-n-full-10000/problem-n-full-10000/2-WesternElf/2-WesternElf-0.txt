The True Tale of the Lord of the Rings Brought to light by Mirriam Neal Part One: The Fellowship of the Ring WARNING: This is a mixture of the movies and the books. I do not own any of the characters. If you have no sense of humor, you probably won't want to read this. Actually, I advise against it as it may result in hysteria, split ribs, and/or fainting. Scene One: Gandalf Arrives at Hobbiton (Scene opens. Frodo is secretly putting in a new pair of contacts. He doesn't want anyone to know that the color of his eyes is really brown.) Gandalf: The road goes ever on and on, until you fall right off a cliff and then your bones are crushed to dust, hmm hmmmm hmm-hmm-hmm…. Frodo: *quickly pops in last contact and runs out to meet the wizard* You're, like, really late. Gandalf: *splutters* That's impossible! Wizards are almost never late! Frodo: *sticks his Rolex in front of Gandalf's nose* You're the 'almost! It says so! *taps watch face* Gandalf: *scowls* Why do I keep visiting you hobbits? Frodo: Because of me, naturally. Gandalf: HAH! You WISH! It's probably Bilbo. He was always a very pleasant hobbit. Frodo: *jumps into wagon, uninvited* Well, then, you'll be glad to know that he's up to something. Gandalf: Oh? Frodo: Yeah. Just wait and see. Later, at Bilbo's Birthday Party Bilbo: My dear Nosepickers and Stinkyfoots! *from somewhere comes the call of "Stinky feet " which Bilbo ignores* Straightjackets and Stickyfingers, and all you other hobbits not sitting on a cushion! *appreciative roar from hobbits* Today is my thirtenty-threeth birthday, and thirtenty-three years is far too long – I mean SHORT! Short a time to live among such infamous and unimaginative hobbits! I dislike more than half of you twice as much as you deserve, and I like less than half of you half as well as you should like! Hobbits: *scattered clapping, some various boos and hisses* Bilbo: So, without any ado, I have decided to take leave of you all and seek my old adventures once again! I - *trips and falls backwards off the stage* Hobbits: *cheer and call for more food* Bilbo: *limps back to Bag End, leaves the Ring for Frodo, and walks – still limping – into the night* Frodo: *bursts in on Gandalf, sitting and staring, hypnotized at the flames* He's gone, isn't he? Gandalf: *somber nod* Frodo: *breaks into a boogie dance screaming 'YESSSSS!' at the top of his lungs, then stops* I mean, well, drat! Scene Two: The Ring (Bilbo has left. Gandalf is explaining the Ring of Doom to Frodo.) Gandalf: Well, what do you think about that? Frodo: *blinks* Huh? Oh, I'm sorry; I dozed off right around the part where you were telling about some… uh, magic nose rings being made? Gandalf: AARRRRGGGHHH! Okay, there's a dark lord named Sauron bent on destroying Middle-earth with his armies of thousands and thousands of Orcs and Uruk-hai and the Nine Ringwraiths who are looking for the ring because Sauron wants it and you've got it, therefore you've got to take it the Last Homely House and give it to the elves. Frodo: Why is the house homely? If it's made by elves, wouldn't it be pretty? Gandalf: It's just a name. I don't know why they called it homely either. Anyway, there's your quest. Frodo: Then I can come home, right? Gandalf: *sighs* Right. Frodo: Okay. Wait, I think I hear something outside! AAAUGH! IT'S A RINGWRAITHE! THEY'VE FOUND ME! Gandalf: *jerks someone in through the window and reveals Sam* No, it's just Sam. Sam: Don't hurt me! Please! Gandalf: Okay, what'dja hear? Sam: Everything. Frodo: Everything? Sam: Yup! I know more about it than you, Mr. Frodo - I wasn't dozing off. Gandalf: Okay, Sam, then YOU do it. Frodo will be your servant along the way. Frodo: WHAT! But – but – Sam: Oh, thank you, Mr. Wizard, sir! Gandalf: Frodo, you'll carry the ring, since you're the servant. This is Sam's quest, now. Frodo: *mumbles* All the good stuff happens to Sam. Scene Three: Bree (Frodo and Sam have already met Merry and Pippin. They are now in the Prancing Pony at Bree.) Sam: That guy over there keeps staring at us. If he doesn't quit, I'll give him a frying panning he'll never forget! Frodo: What's wrong with him looking at us? It's a free town… I think. Sam: It's very suspicious. Frodo: Huh? No, it isn't. Where's Pippin? *sees Pippin babbling everything about who Frodo really is, who his second cousins twice removed are, and his favorite baseball team* PIPPIN! SHUT UP! *gets up and runs over, then trips and falls and 'accidentally-on-purpose' puts the ring on* YIKES! Sam: WHERE'D YOU GO! Strange Guy in the Corner: *chokes on pipe smoke* Frodo: *appears sitting at table as if nothing had happened, but it's the wrong table* Strange Guy in the Corner: Hello. *grabs Frodo and hauls him upstairs* So you have the Ring of Doom! I knew somebody did! Well, I'd be more careful if I were you, because – *door bursts open revealing the other hobbits* Well, that's cute. Frodo: *rolls eyes* So you're going with us or something? Because Gandalf's not here… Strange Guy No Longer in Corner: Yeah, sure, I'd be glad to take you to Mount Doom. Don't worry, I know all about it. And you can call me Strider, Aragorn, Elessar, the Elf-stone, Rightful King of Gondor… whatever. Frodo: I'll stick with Aragorn. Meanwhile, at Isengard… Saruman: I am no longer Saruman the White. I am Saruman of many colors! Gandalf: You forgot to separate the whites again, didn't you? Back with the hobbits, Aragorn starts singing and Frodo asks him to please cut it out. Scene Four: Weathertop (Frodo has just awakened to the smell of to-MAH-toes and bacon.) Frodo: *jumps up* Yum! That smells GOOD! Oh, wait, I mean – What are you doing, you fools! Put it out! Put it out! *Frodo stamps on the fire* Ouch! Ouch! Hot! Ouch! Pippin: Great. Hobbit hair on my tomahtoes. Thanks, Frodo. *an eerie screech drifts through the night air* Merry: That must be those funky guys in the ratty black cloaks. Frodo: Yeah, probably. Either that or Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. Sam: Strider/Elessar/Aragorn/Elf-stone/Rightful King of Gondor left us each a sword which he just happened to have with him. They're hobbit-sized, too! Pippin: Ooooh! Shiny! *yanks sword from sheath* Merry: He gave Pippin something sharp! Is he mad! Pippin: *squinting closely at elvish writing on the blade* It says… made… in… China… Sam: *blinks* Where's China? Frodo: OH NO! LOOK! The Five Funky Guys! Five Funky Guys, also known as The Ringwraiths: *appear holding swords* We are here! Fear us! Shall we introduce ourselves before any further trouble? Frodo: Uh… go ahead? Lead Wraith: *clears throat* This is Tom, Dick, and Harry. The four that are not here are Larry, Bill, Bob, and Joe. And I am Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian. The Third. Pippin: *falls over in a dead faint* Frodo: Why do YOU get the long name, and they all have short ones? Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: Mom liked me best. Bob: She did NOT! Dick: I second! Tom: I third it! Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: SHUT UP! We're supposed to be attacking! Sam: Oh, yeah. *whips out sword as Merry helps Pippin to his feet* GET AWAY! *swipe swipe* Tom: Hi-YAH! *trips over a rock and lands flat on his nonexistent face* OUCH! I told you, Reggie, not to get me these metal-toed shoes! They make me trip! Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: HOW MANY TIMES DID MOM TELL YOU NOT TO CALLL ME REGGIE! Tom: Uh, Ferdie? Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: NO! Tom: Sebbie? *blinks* Uh… Bastian? Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: Why you little SWINE! I'll stove your head in! Tom: *lower lip quivers* (This was before Wraith faces, but after lip quivers.) Aragorn: *appears and waves fire in front of them* Ringwraiths: AAAH! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! *hiking up their black robes, they all run away* Reginald Ferdinand Sebastian: *quickly scuttles back in, stabs Frodo in the leg, runs out* Frodo: My LEG! It's supposed to be my SHOULDER! Now I'm going to have a LIMP! FOREVER! Reginald: *voice faint* SOORRRRYYY! Scene Five: Arwen (Arwen appeared and is riding with Frodo) Arwen: Noro lim, Asfaloth! Noro Lim! Frodo: OWWW! MY LEG! And what in the world does 'noro leem' mean? Arwen: Um, ride fast. Frodo: Well, duh. Arwen: *rolls eyes* Frodo: Hey, look! Wraiths! Arwen: Oh boy! HANG ON! Frodo: Should I put my hands in the air? Arwen: Not a good idea. *starts riding faster and faster and faster until they reach the river and gallop across it* If you want him, come an' get 'im! Come on! Come on, just try! Ringwraiths: *look at each other* Okay! *charge across the river* Arwen: *recites spell, water runs down and washes them away* Ringwraiths: AAAAaaaaahhhhhhh! Arwen: HAH! Showed them, huh, Frodo? Uh-oh, Frodo? Frodo: *moans* Arwen: Um… whatever you gave me, give him grace! No, I mean gracefully give me him! Um, spare me, but give him grace! AARGH! DADDY! Scene Six: Rivendell (Frodo has just awoken Imladris.) Frodo: Ooooh, my head! Gandalf: Your head? The wraith stabbed your leg! Frodo: Yeah, but all that elvish.! *sighs and flops back onto pillow* * Seconds tick by* Frodo: *eyes slide over to Gandalf* Hey, when did you get here? Gandalf: Sheesh, I was wondering when you were going to ask. Saruman, my EX friend, turned bad. He's with Sauron now. Frodo: Bummer. Where's Sam? Gandalf: He's around here somewhere. He pops in now and then to check up. I think he's looking for a chocolate bar in the fridge right now. Frodo: *pouty look* Sure, HE gets the chocolate. HE'S not the one that got STABBED! Sam: *walks in, mouth full of chocolate* Hey, Frrrdo! Gwad you're 'kay. Frodo: Wow, thanks, Sam. Sam: No probl'm. Frodo: The LEAST you could have done is BROUGHT ME CHOCOLATE! Sam: *blinks, digesting this bit of information, then swallows* Sorry. Frodo: AAAUGGH! Scene Seven: Council of Elrond (Everyone is seated in a circle. The elves unfairly outnumber any other race present, and Elrond has obviously been doing his eyebrow push-ups.) Elrond: The ring can't stay here. It's dangerous. Somebody's got to travel across Middle-earth through the dark, evil, orc-and-Uruk-hai-filled lands of Mordor and throw the ring into the fiery chasms of Mount Doom, all the while trying to make sure Sauron, who happens to be a huge eye, doesn't see you. Council: *blinks several times* Boromir: *stands up* Hey, why not just give it to me? I'll give it to Dad for Father's Day. He'll love it. Legolas: No way! Gimli: Ye Gads! It's a boy! Legolas: *jumps up* HEY! Gimli: Well, it's hard to tell with elves, you know. Legolas: WHY YOU – Aragorn: HAVO DAD! LEGOLAS! SIT! GOOD BOY! Legolas: *thunks down into chair with a put out expression while Gimli chuckles* Aragorn: Anyway, Boromir, that was a nice try, but I'm the rightful heir to Gondor. Sorry. Boromir: But – but – but – Aragorn: *shrugs* Not my fault. Boromir: Sheesh. Elrond: Hell-OOO? Guys? The ring? It's got to be destroyed. Gimli: And why can't I just hit it with my ax? Elrond: It won't work. Only the fires of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged, can destroy it. Gimli: Bummer. Real bummer. Elves: *echoing* Yeah, real bummer. Gimli: I've got an idea! Let's argue! Elves: Yeah! *everyone starts fighting* Frodo: I'll take it! Everyone else: *too busy fighting to notice Frodo* Frodo: *at the top of his lungs* HEY! I'm, like, trying to be all brave and noble here so would you old men stop fighting and LISTEN TO ME! *everyone turns and looks at him* Frodo: I said, I'll take the ring! *heavy sigh* I brought it this far. *thinking* Hah! Now it'll be MY quest again, not SAM'S! Sam: *pops out* Not
