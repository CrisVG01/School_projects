Okay so hi! I've been reading a few Chaos and Percy Jackson stories and I REALLY want to give it a shot. If y'all like it, keep reading along. If you don't like it, tell me what you don't like about it and stop. I won't beg y'all to read it if it is that bad. So here we go! Percy POV- Who would have thought there would be something worse than a Giant War? Something worse than walking through hell? Well I most certainly never did. I always thought I would finally get my well-deserved break. That Annabeth and I would be able to live happily ever after. That illusion did play on my hopes for at least a little while... Before the Fates decided it was time to mess with me again. So now as I sit in a tree, resting before going search again, I replay the memories of my life these last few months. **Two months before** It was getting late, very very late. Annabeth, Grover, Juniper, Jason, Piper and I all sat on the beach, watching as the bright orange sun finally set after another blissful day. The purples and pinks clashing against the soft oranges and calming yellows. Annabeth laid against my chest, her eyes closed as she listened to Jason and Piper talk about their own future. Annabeth and I already discussed that we will take life as it goes, just letting events play out and we will make our choices when we think they're right. Grover and Juniper seemed to be in their own world, Grover whispering to her and Juniper giggling. It was nice to see my best friend happy, to be in love. I lightly kissed the top of Annabeth's head for no reason, just glad to have this peaceful moment. "We should probably get going before we get in trouble." Jason said abruptly. We all glared at him playfully, which caused him to turn bright red in embarrassment. "I guess that would be for the best." I said before picking Annabeth up and spinning her around in my arms. She squealed, shrieking "Seaweed Brain!" But laughing at the same time. "I'll see you guys tomorrow!" I said as I began to run with Annabeth in my arms, spinning ever now and then and kissing her all over her face. Reaching Cabin 6, I carefully placed her down. She stumbled a little from dizziness but I found it extremely adorable. I kissed her goodnight, but she grabbed my wrist before I could walk away. "I love you." She whispered softly to me. I flashed a lopsided grin before kissing her again. "And I love you, my Wise Girl." I whispered back. She giggled quietly and wrapped her arms around me and I did the same. We stayed like that, and I wished we could have stayed like that forever. She was all I would ever need, and all I could ever want. A piercing scream is what broke us apart, and we barely cast a glance at one another before sprinting to see what caused the scream. Near the entrance of Camp Half-Blood was a boy who was desperately trying to escape a dracaena. There was a large cut on his arm, probably from the bloody dagger the dracaena held. He stumbled towards the entrance and I knew I had to help. "You help him get in the camp, I got the monster." I whispered to Annabeth, kissing her forehead before grabbing Riptide and sprinting towards the dracaena. Annabeth was helping the boy get up, the boy leaning heavily against her as they stumbled past the entrance. "Hey!" I shouted to the dracaena, who immediately looked at me. A sly smile crossed it lips. "Well well, Percy Jackson, looks like I'll finally have the honor of killing you." She said in a sickly sweet voice. I rolled my eyes. "Dying isn't on my schedule for this evening." I said before swiftly slicing my sword right through her body. A wail escaped her mouth before she exploded into gold dust. I started back towards the entrance of the Camp, where the boy was laying dazed as he panted for a breath. I guess he could be attractive, with his dark brown eyes and sandy blonde hair. He was tall and well built, most likely a football player. I looked at Annabeth who was trying to calm him down, so he could breath normally. Galloping was what caused Annabeth and I to look up. Chiron was making his way towards us, concern evident in his eyes. "What happened?" He asked us both. Annabeth launched into the story before I could even open my mouth. When she finally finished, the boy let out a huge gasp as he sat up. We all looked at him and saw the glowing lightning bolt over his head. "What is your name?" Chiron asked the boy. The boy was staring at both the lightning bolt and Chiron with fear in his eyes. "J-James." He stuttered. "James Awyr." "Well, James, do you know anything about Greek mythology?" I asked him. He nodded after a moment. "W-We're learning about that in History class." He said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. I was seriously fighting against rolling my eyes. He was an arrogant son of a bitch, I could tell already. "All those stories are true. And you are the son of one of those gods, Zeus." Annabeth said, exchanging a look with me. Another son of Zeus? Seems almost impossible, since Zeus swore he was the parent to only Jason and Thalia, only those two demigods. James laughed nervously. "You're joking right?" He asked, and we all shook our head. "I am a demigod also. Son of Poseidon to be in fact." I said. James stared at me incredulously. "And I'm the daughter of Athena." Annabeth stated proudly. I smiled at her in which she returned. James looked at both of us a few times before nodding. "This should be interesting." He says, and Chiron chuckled. "Indeed it will be, my boy. But for now, you need to get that arm wrapped and a goodnight's sleep." Chiron said as him and I helped James up again. Chiron lead James to the Big House as Annabeth and I stayed back. "I think we all need to get some sleep." Annabeth said, kissing my cheek. "Goodnight." She said before walking to her cabin. *Flashback ended* I sigh quietly as I stare up at the stars. If only I knew what was coming, I would have never went to rescue that boy. **One month before** James, quickly recovering from his shock and realizing who he was, became my worst nightmare. He found out my story, how I was Olympus's Hero. And he became jealous, jealous that the attention wasn't on him any longer. He was the star quarterback at his old school, and he was the one all the girls wanted to date and all the boys wanted to be. But it wasn't the same here, everyone was equal, except for a few people like Jason, Annabeth and I. He knew that if he really wanted to be the camp's leader, he had to get through me first. He started with the new campers, the ones who came after the wars. He convinced them first that it was he who saved the world, and they believed him. I was shot glares at from those campers, which puzzled me but I brushed it off. I didn't really mind that they didn't like me, I didn't expect everyone to love me. I thought if I just stayed the way I was, they would eventually stop glaring and realized I meant no harm. When James realized I didn't really care if the new campers liked me or not, he went a little deeper towards my heart. He went after my friends. He easily took down Katie Gardner and the Stolls first. He destroyed Katie's prized garden but overflowing it with water which caused the plants to uproot and die. And since I'm the only son of Poseidon and with a little convincing on James's behalf, Katie blamed me. With Katie's hatred towards me, Travis soon followed. Travis loves Katie with all his heart and will always believe her. Travis told Connor of my "betrayal" and Connor listened to his own brother instead of me. The lose of their friendship was a serious blow to my heart. Grover was next. James burned Juniper's tree and hid the matches by my doorway. Grover and Juniper blamed me for all of it, which caused Grover to cut the empathy link between us two. I felt as if a part of me was cut away, missing something. James convinced Nico that I was never sorry for Bianca's death. That I just stood by and watched as she died with a grin on my face. Nico told Will of this since they were dating and I had the stomach flu for a week. Jason and Piper were some of the last to go, with James sneakily cutting off nearly all of Piper's hair but then hiding the shears and cut off hair in my cabin while I slept. Piper blamed me for all of it, feeling betrayed by what happened and Jason followed soon after, believing that I did it. I only had Annabeth, Chiron, Clarrise and Chris left in the camp. They were the only ones that believed me... For a little while longer. Chiron was obvious to all of this, since I kept quiet about it. I couldn't let this get to my head and destroy the few precious things I had in life yet. Clarrise would always hurt James if he even came near her, since she never did like newbies. He decided she was useless in all of this and left her be. Chris was always around Clarrise, since they were unofficially dating. Annabeth was the snapping point. She "loved" me everyday as this all happened, so I never believed there was something wrong with our relationship. That was until I found her in the Strawberry fields with James. I was going to just get some peace from all the glares I was receiving. I sat in the fields in total silence, just enjoying the silent winds blow against my face and the lovely smells of fruit surrounding me. Giggles snapped me out of my peace. Along with whispering with even more giggling. I looked around until my eyes landed on a couple who were laying in the fields. From here, I could see golden blonde hair, the same curly blonde hair I've come to love. Scrambling to my feet, my heart racing, I went towards the couple. It couldn't be her, it couldn't be. My heart dropped when I saw who it was. Annabeth was curling up against the one and only, James. They were whispering to one another and Annabeth kept giggling quietly. "H-How could you?" I whispered brokenly. Annabeth's grey eyes snapped to me and she gasped, scrambling to her feet. "Percy! I didn't know you would be here! I-!" She started but I held my hand up to stop her. "Don't." I said quietly but firmly. Her mouth closed as she stared at me. James was watching with an amused and smug expression. "You won." I whispered to James, who grinned proudly before I turned on my heel and stormed off. What I didn't realize was that I was starting to glow a faint sea-green. I was pissed, I was furious. I was broken. Before I could do anything I'd regret, I sprinted to my cabin and I slammed the door. My mind went blank as I quickly shoved a few things into my backpack. Provisions, water, mortal money, drachmas, a flask of nectar and a few squares of ambrosia. I stuffed Riptide into my pocket and I put on my watch that was also the
