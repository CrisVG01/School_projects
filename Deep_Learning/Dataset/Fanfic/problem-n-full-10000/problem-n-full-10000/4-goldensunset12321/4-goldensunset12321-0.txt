Welcome to the Cullen family Written By: golden_sunset_12321 Summary: A peek inside the daily lives of my favorite vampire family. Warning: The spanking of teenage vampires and shape shifting wolves. And the spanking of a half human half vampire child. Note: I changed a few things around. First off, Jacob did not imprint on Renesmme. He, Seth, and Leah did stand up against Sam and the rest of the pack in order to save the Cullen's, and later against the Volturi, but he did not imprint. Secondly, Jacob and Leah are mated; both are seventeen. Seth is fifteen. I did this mainly because I wanted all three of the wolfies to have mates, but did not want to add a lot of new characters to the story. I plan on adding a teen vampire girl later on for Seth's mate and a younger girl after that. (I'm thinking I'll make her a witch.) I wanted Nessie to be an actual kid longer, so in this story she stopped her rapid growth rate at the appearance of a seven-year-old. She will grow and mature as a regular kid until she reaches seventeen, then stop ageing. This story is set a year after the whole Volturi thing, so she appears to be eight-years-old. Lastly, Leah's and Seth's Mom passed away when Seth was five and Leah was seven. She died in the same crash that killed Jacob's mom. After their Dad died, Billy took them in. Jake, Leah, and Seth live with Billy; but they spend a lot of time with the Cullen's. Jake is an only child, his sisters do not exist in this story.

Dad was upstairs in his office; Mom was outside in her flower garden. Bella, Rosalie, Alice, and Leah were upstairs in Rosalie's room looking at fashion magazines and talking about clothes. It's kinda hard to believe that my Bella is up there enjoying herself; she didn't used to be into fashion. But after her transformation, she now loves fashion and shopping. I guess she feels more confident about herself now, and is more eager to express herself. She still isn't as bad as my sisters about shopping though, her limit is three hours at a time. Rosalie and Alice can spend an entire day and night shopping. And Leah isn't too far behind. Emmett, Jasper, Jake, and Seth were sitting on the sofa playing call of duty on the X Box. And acting like seven-year-olds. They were in a heated battle at the moment, each yelling out taunts to the other players. Now that I know Jake isn't trying to steal my wife, I enjoy his company. He still loves her, and she loves him. But it's a brother-sister kind of love. He, Seth, and Leah are over here a lot. And every one of us are fine with that, we enjoy their company. We were all surprised when Jacob and Leah imprinted on each other. We were even more surprised when we walked into our living room a few months ago and found them both half naked and making out in the floor. Luckily Renesmme was with Charlie at the time, I really do not want to have THAT talk with my little girl just yet. I was sitting at the piano, with my beautiful and very talented daughter sitting beside me. I was teaching her a new song. Renesmee was a natural musician and was learning the song very quickly. Nessie was only about three years old, but she appeared to be eight. Her maturity and emotional level was that of an eight-year-old, but she was way smarter than any human eight-year-old. Dad believes that she will grow normally now, well until she reaches seventeen. That was wonderful news to me, it meant that my little girl would be a child longer then we first thought. I was already dreading the day when my baby will consider herself too old for bedtime stories and hugs and kisses. Since she will age normally now, we will enroll her into school next year. She is smart enough to be in at least the ninth grade, and getting smarter every day. But we want her to interact with kids her own physical and emotional age and be a normal kid. She will be entering the fourth grade, since she will be physically and emotionally nine-years-old when the new school year starts. "Yes!" Emmett's booming voice caused both Nessie and me to jump slightly. He was now standing up, with an ecstatic smile on his face. "I am the king of the X-Box." "I want a rematch." Jake declared. "Want to lose again, Wolf Boy?" Emmett taunted. "I agree with Jake." Seth said. "I want a rematch too." "Well I guess instead of monkey see monkey do, its doggie see doggie do." Emmett laughed. I had to smile at that one, it was funny. I knew he was only playing, and so did Jake and Seth. "I'd rather be a doggie then an overgrown moose." Jake said. He stood up and pushed Emmett in the chest, causing the bruin to take a step back. "You want to fight, puppy?" Emmett asked, with a smirk. "You and Scrappy doo there against me and Jasper?" "Hey." Jasper protested, standing up. "Leave me out of this." "Scared?" Seth asked, as he stood up and stood next to Jake. "No, but you should be." Jasper said. "Daddy." Nessie said. "This is not going to end well, is it?" Before I could answer, all four boys were rolling around in the floor. Emmett and Jake were a tangle of arms and legs as they rolled into one of the end tables, shattering it into many pieces. The smashed table didn't stop them; they simply started rolling in the other direction. Jasper and Seth were also tangled together and rolling around. I knew that Jasper could pin the younger boy any time he wanted to, Seth was no match for him. Jasper was just toying with him. They rolled into the coffee table, breaking a leg off of it and sending it crashing to the floor. When it did, the three vases sitting on the table also smashed in the floor. They didn't stop their play fight though; they just continued to roll around the floor. "What is going on?" Dad's voice boomed. He was standing at the bottom of the stairs, an angry expression on his face. The girls were standing behind him, smirking. The four brawling teens just kept on rolling around. "Enough!" Dad's voice boomed loudly. "Front and center!" Instantly, all four combatants were standing on their own feet and looking nervous. Dad didn't shout often, and when he did you knew someone was in trouble. I had a hard time not laughing out loud when I read my daughter's thoughts. She was wondering if her Grandpa Carlisle was an Army drill sergeant in the past. "What happened in here?" Mom asked, as she came into the room and looked around at the splintered wood and glass that were scattered in the floor. "Iâ€¦it was an accident." Emmett said. All four were now looking at their own feet. "An accident that was caused by roughhousing." Dad said, as he glared at them. His voice was stern and I was so glad that I was not involved in this. Both Mom and Dad had forbidden fighting in the house. "Boys are so immature." Rosalie said, causing Dad to turn his glare towards her. "Back upstairs." He barked. All for girls quickly disappeared. "Come on, Nessie." I said, standing up. "Let's go play outside." "Okay, Daddy." She said, jumping up. "Wait a minute." Dad said, looking at us. "Were you two involved in this?" "No Sir." I said quickly. "Of course not, Grandpa Carlisle." My precious daughter said. "I am smart enough to know better." I tried to hold back my laughter, I really did. But I failed. Mom quickly held a hand to her mouth, no doubt trying to contain her own laughter. Dad smirked, also finding her remark funny. Emmett, Jasper, Jake, and Seth glared at her. But there was no heat in their glares. "Alright." Dad said, smiling at his granddaughter. "Go on." Nessie took my hand and pulled me towards the door. 3563489563490563295632875632874532874632875639875638352598762359873645463895623589736259782463904273658934765047935698356932856349085643985604329856348956239085629340856390485693428569423856398456934865934786547398653408965384056439805634985632048965903465092835629308562096523906 Carlisle's Point Of View After Edward and Renesmme left the room, I looked at the four house wreakers and gave them a hard glare. All four of them looked nervous and were staring at the floor. "Explain." I ordered. My voice was soft and calm, but they knew it was an order. "It was my fault." Emmett said, still looking at the floor. I was not surprised to hear that, nor was I surprised that he admitted it. Emmett was a good kid, but he was also mischievous. And he let that side of him overrule his common sense a lot. But he always admitted when he did something wrong. "It was all of our faults." Jasper said. "What happened?" I asked them. "We were playing Call of Duty." Jasper said. "And kinda got carried away." "Emmett won." Jacob said. "And I started demanding a rematch, and then things kinda spiraled downhill from there." "We're really sorry, Carlisle." Seth said. "I want this mess cleaned up." I said. "At normal speed, then all four of you find yourselves a corner." All four groaned, but none of them argued. I walked out of the room and motioned for Esme to follow me, we needed to discuss how to handle the four troublemakers. 3563489563490563295632875632874532874632875639875638352598762359873645463895623589736259782463904273658934765047935698356932856349085643985604329856348956239085629340856390485693428569423856398456934865934786547398653408965384056439805634985632048965903465092835629308562096523906 Emmett's Point Of View Dad was going to kill us, no doubt about it. He and Mom had warned us more times than I can remember about play fighting in the house. "Sorry guys." I sighed, after the room was cleaned up. "It's not all your fault." Jasper said. "We were all involved in it." "What do you think Carlisle will do?" Seth asked nervously. "What do you think?" Jacob asked. "He's going to go ballistic on our asses." "No he won't." Jasper said, placing a hand on Seth's shoulder and giving Jake a glare. Dad had no problems spanking the wolfies if they broke the rules while here; Billy gave him permission to treat them like he does us. Jake has been on the receiving end of Dad's hand a few times. But Seth had only gotten a couple warning swats so far, he's normally a very well behaved kid. I could tell he was real nervous. Leah had never even been swatted; she's the smart one of the group. "He won't spank us?" Seth asked Jasper, with hopeful eyes. "He probably will." Jasper sighed. "But it won't be that bad, just a few smacks to get our attention." "Yeah, kid." Jake said. "Carlisle's a fair man. "It'll be okay." "We better do what Dad said." I said, looking miserably at a corner. I hated corner time with a passion. We all did. Which is probably why Mom and Dad use it as a punishment. 3563489563490563295632875632874532874632875639875638352598762359873645463895623589736259782463904273658934765047935698356932856349085643985604329856348956239085629340856390485693428569423856398456934865934786547398653408965384056439805634985632048965903465092835629308562096523906 Carlisle's Point Of View I walked back into the living room and find all four boys standing with their noses in corners. I hated to punish them, but they had to know that their actions had consequences. "Come here, boys." I said, my voice soft. They turned and walked over to me, stopping a couple feet away. "You four know the rules about roughhousing." I started to lecture. "All of you are very strong and can easily break things, like you did a few moments ago. I don't mind you wrestling outside, in fact I encourage it. But the house is no place for it." "We're really sorry, Papa." Jasper said in a southern drawl. He was the only one of my
