OOC: Um...hi. What am I supposed to put here...? A/N- WOOOT! Guess who's back! ME! I told myself I would never write one of these...but I did. Sigh. Luckily, it's not a Mary Sue. Woot. BTW, this is the writer formally (and still) known as Rumbottom. Lady Rumbottom. Other fics will be put on momentary hold. (This is "Chelsea's" account. Jamie has the OOCs, interpreted differently than normally. Out of Character, meaning OUT of character, instead of "out of CHARACTER." Got it? Great. Normally, the top will be Jamie's section, but as this is her first fic (huzzah!), I'm kinda taking over. Disclaimer - We don't own anything you recognize. Which means *deep breath* Legolas, Pippin, Frodo, any and all LotR characters, settings, languages, any quotes that are vaguely recognizable, etc. etc. etc. BUT WE DO OWN VALANDIL, AND THAT MAKES ME ETERNALLY PROUD! And now, without further ado... LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE FANGIRL! Chapter One *Chelsea's POV* So another Gold Day dawned: boring, bright, and…gold. I had just left the Math Lab with Stepho, complaining. "Well, I'm off to History. See ya later!" I said, waving as we parted paths. I tripped into the land more commonly known as the Realm of Eternal Boredom. "Blahdiddyblahblahblah…." Oh, sigh. I was uber bored. To sum it all up, history was historic. At the end of the day, I was singing to my locker as usual. Jamie walked up just as the locker door gave way. "Hey," she said, ogling my Paris of Troy picture. "Hello, my ferret friend!" I said, shoving my science book in. Jamie sighed: "Why am I a ferret?" "Erm…. i dunno," I replied, gazing off into space. "Only 96 more days until Troy!" Jamie grinned. "Parappetizer?" I questioned. "Definitely." It was quiet as I threw my other numerous books n. I picked up the last one, savoring the weight of the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jamie eyed it suspiciously. "Where did you get that?" "Flea market!" I said happily. The leather bound edition was dirty and mangled on the outside, but the inside was as good as new. Or so I thought. I'd never really seen it… My fingers pried it open, and indeed it was perfect… Save for a note written in an intricate script. Book of Tolkien, book divine… Reader, beware, Within these pages lurks dangerous warfare Reader, heed Beyond this point you will not be freed. It was silent, and I could have sworn I heard thunder rumbling outside. But it was perfectly sunny outside. Jamie laughed nervously. "What find of freak would write something like…?" But I didn't hear the rest, as I was too busy throwing down the book and screaming "HYAH, EVIL BOOK!" Jamie looked somewhat amused, somewhat scared. I turned back to my locker to see every one of my Lord of the Rings pictures glowing bright blue. "What's going on here?" we said in panicked unison. I turned around to see the book…was gone. Oh, crap. I leaned in for a closer look at the now-seemingly radioactive pictures, and felt a gust of wind and unfamiliar voices. It wasn't until I heard some anonymous passerby scream I noticed we were being sucked into the book, which was levitating in the air. "CHELSEA! I DO NOT LIKE THIS!" Jamie screamed, reaching for her stuff. I copied her actions and screeched in reply, "LIKE I DO?!" Holding tightly to our backpacks, we were thrown into a black vortex. ***** Thump. Thump. Jamie and I fell. "Where are we?" I heard her say. I slowly stood up and looked around. Rivers, mountains, light woods, flowers…and lots of rivers were ahead. It looked just like…but no…it couldn't be… FWAP! "OW! JAMIE, WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT FOR!!!!???" I screamed. "So that hurt?" she said anxiously, wielding her science folder. "YES! WHY WOULDN'T IT!?" "Stop yelling a minute, would you?" she hissed, throwing her science folder down. Then it dawned on me. "Um…Jamie? We're not dreaming." "I know. You can't be hurt in dreams or nightmares…" I was still rubbing my painful head. Mrs. Hedrick must give a buttload of work… "We're in Rivendell," I whispered, watching a little river flow by as we walked on in confusion. "What?" she squawked. "Rivendell." "What?" "RIVENDELL!" I screamed. A bird (or twenty) took flight as my voice echoed throughout the foreign landscape. "Isn't that the Elfy place?" Jamie blinked. "Yes. It's that Elfy place…" I said sarcastically. "WE'RE IN MIDDLE EARTH!" We blinked in silence for a while. "Mi-" I began to repeat. A hand was clapped over my mouth, and I almost fainted from glee. "ELVES! ELVES, JAMIE, ELVES!" is what I tried to say, but it came out sounding like "MMLS! MMLS, MMIE, MMLS!" "You are intruding on the land of Elrond Halfelven, the land of Rivendell," the taller elf (mine!) said, frowning charily. I beamed. "Mae govannae! Sut naa lle?" I said, attempting a curtsy (my attempts rewarding in toppling over at the elves feet.). Looking around, I saw 3 elves behind me, arrows raised. 2 stood in front of Jamie and me. They all appeared taken aback. "See? I knew Elf Day would come in handy!" I whispered to Jamie. She gave me a Look, one that said, "SHUT UP! If you talk anymore, they might kill you! And possibly me! Not good!" The elves conversed amongst themselves in, no surprises there, Elvish. A few minutes later, they turned to us and said: "Your fate is no longer ours to decide. We will take you to Lord Elrond, and there is where your destiny lies," the taller one said. He looked vaguely familiar… As we walked away, I realized it. "OH MY GOD! YOU'RE GLORFINDEL!" I screeched. He winced. "JAMIE! IT'S GLORFINDEL!" "I can hear you fine from right here, Chelsea," she grumbled. I did my happy hobbit dance. "We're going to Rivendell! R-I-V-E-N-D-E-L-L! GOOO RIVENDELL!" I began to cheer. "Chelsea, please, for Will Turner's sake, stop cheering," Jamie sighed. "Well, if it's for Will…" I considered, and shut up, humming "Into the West" under my breath. ***** **Jamie's POV** As the elves led us away, I too screamed when Chelsea did. Her screeching surprised me and after a bit of calming down, I tried to ask her a question. "Who is Glorfindel?" I whispered into her ear. More screeching. She practically yelled in my ear, "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?" I glared at her with a look clearly telling her to "shut up". *Two Hours Later* "Ugh, I mean, Argh, grossness," I sighed as we pushed through a nasty, muddy bog. Chelsea's loose-fitting flip-flops were bogging her down, so she "let 'em fly". The brown gick was oozing through her "weird" toes. It gave the impression that we had painted our toenails a gross poop-brown. All was quiet except for the mud sucking at our feet and Chelsea's muttering of, "Hehe, toenails are funny. Hehe, very funny." The elves barely got their boots dirty as they pranced over the goop. We approached the boundaries of Rivendell. ***** **Chelsea's POV** "Oh it's BEAUTIFUL!" I whispered in awe of the Elves' home. Jamie was in awe too, or she just really liked Elves. I turned to an Elf: "Do you have anywhere to wash my feet?" I wriggled my toes for emphasis, and the Elves winced in disgust. We were led inside. Joy, rapture, transient bliss. Let me just say this: the movie did not do Rivendell justice. There, everything looked very CGI. In real life, it's much prettier. I tripped several times, walking and gawking. We neared the House of Elrond, and again the elves muttered amongst themselves. "Why didn't I take that online Elfish course?! WHY?!" I fake-sobbed to Jamie. "Chelsea, you do realize we are in Middle Earth, right?" she said quietly. I nodded, and looked back down at my muddy feet, flip-flops in hand. "This is…revolting," I muttered. Jamie nodded in agreement. "Elrond will see you now," another Elf said. (Glorfindel had left…aww…he was hot too. Yes, I have a very one-track mind.). We were pushed towards a very recognizable looking garden. There were no people of any kind as Jamie and I walked forward. "This seems vaguely familiar…" I frowned. "We're going to the Council of Elrond," Jamie shrugged. "Really?!" I squeaked. "Um…I don't-" She was cut off by my squeal of, "YAY! WE'RE GOING TO MORDOR!" "Well, not technically, depending which way we take, if we are even GOING with the Fellowship…." As she talked, our guard elves reappeared. "Excuse me, Mr.…" Jamie began. "EXCUSE ME MR.! BUT I'VE BEEN WAITING IN LINE AND I'D LIKE TO BUY SOME OF YOUR TIME!" I started singing, head banging. All of them gave me quizzical looks. Ah, No Doubt. How I love thee… We were shoved into a clearing where an array of elves, dwarves, humans, and hobbits were discussing the One Ring. We had reached the Council of Elrond. Score. "Lord Elrond…" a younger (yummier) elf said, bowing low to the ground. Captain Forehead looked up. Jamie kicked me, and we bowed. "These intruders were caught off the western border…" "Hey, who are you calling an-" I stopped talking when I realized every eye in the courtyard was on me. "Umm… mae govannae, sut naa lle?" Thank God for Elf Day, that's all I have to say. A few faces relaxed, but the others remained distrustfully stony. I looked around as Elrond and the other Elves that had brought Jamie and I here muttered in Elvish. I recognized many faces, which was odd… Oh my god! It's Aragorn! And over there, Gandalf! Next to him, FRODO! Aww…hobbits are even cuter in real life! Boromir, a bunch of elves I don't know…This is too weird! I thought, looking around. "Where are you from?" I heard Captain Forehead ask, his Amazing Eyebrows of Disaster arched. "America," Jamie answered before I could say anything. The murmuring started low, like a drone of bees. Steadily, it increased, until the entire place was arguing about the Ring (woah, big subject change, hmm?) "What do we do?" I hissed to Jamie. "We can't run…I have no idea where we are …or where we can go…" she said, more to herself than to me. "I have a plan!" I muttered. "Oh, no, Chelsea, no more singing, please…" As the argument continued, I screamed, "I CAN'T BREATHE!" and fell backwards. Of course, I didn't see the stone bench behind me. It connected with my head, and I blacked out. ***** "When we get back to our world, I am so taking your Elvish butt on Judge Judy! Your benches gave my friend a concussion!" I heard a voice yell. "Mmm…elves…" I murmured sleepily. The yelling ceased to exist, and I opened my eyes. "You're not dead, then!" Jamie smiled. Elrond was near me too, looking confused by Jamie's "Judge Judy" threat. Let me just say how big his forehead is. We're talking Enrique's mole big (before it was removed). Gargantuan big. Scarily big. So big it caused me to gawk for several minutes, and shudder. "Welcome to Rivendell," he said, massive frown lines showing. "Dude…you said that to Frodo too…" I yawned. "You are in the House of Elrond…" "I know, Halfelven. I read the books AND saw the movies," I snickered. "What?" he said, utterly bamboozled again. "She's still delusional," Jamie assured him. I looked around to see another familiar face… "Gaaanndalf?" I said stupidly, like Frodo in RotK (which yields no offense to the Frodo Fans). "Yes, I am Gandalf the Grey…" "GANDALF!" I screeched. "Chelsea…calm down…" Jamie groaned, burying her face in her hands in ignominy. "You're sooo cool! I've always wanted to meet a Wizard! And you helped Bilbo with that quest he took and the trolls and AAAAAH!" I gushed. Gandalf appeared embarrassed. He doesn't have many fangirls, you know. Gandalf and Captain Forehead left a few minutes later, after ensuring I wasn't dead. "So, spill.
