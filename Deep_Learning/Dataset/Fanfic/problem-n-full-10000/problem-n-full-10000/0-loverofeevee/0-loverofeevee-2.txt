The Power He Knows Not Harry rolled his stiff body onto his side, shifting himself into a moderately comfortable position. Kill Somewhere in Britain a masked man screamed his last breath. Yawning Harry shifted a little more, finally finding a position that didn't dig into his ribs, and settled for the night. At least he thought it was night. It was hard to tell time from his cell. Although he supposed it would be hard to tell what time it was regardless of where you were in this blasted building, with its dank walls and icy atmosphere. Well at least the Dementors were no longer around. Nor for that matter were his neighbours, having long since died by the green flash of death. Harry was indifferent to all of it, and had been for months now. Perhaps even years. Whatever thrill he got out of his mental adventures were long gone, hell even his sense of duty had vanished. Now, he was just doing it to relieve the boredom. Kill 'Another one bites the dust' he sang quietly to himself. A long time ago, he was amused at the literal thought of having his mortal enemy do Harry's job for him. After all, it was always him who had to fight the bad guy. Him who had to face Voldemort time and time again with little to no help from others. Discovering that he could tap into old Voldy's mind, and manipulate the man into being his slave, was almost a blessing. Almost, because it took so damn long to figure out how he was doing it, and even longer to realise the potential of his link to the man. After all the shit he put up with in his fifth year, not to mention the grief, well two could play that game. How he got into Azkaban in the first place was almost a funny story, funny if it had happened to some more deserving bastard of course. ***Flashback*** He had read the Half Blood Prince book from cover to cover, annoying Hermione to no end by using its contents in potions class. Then along came Draco Bloody Malfoy, and everything went to hell. The little ferret was up to something, he knew it, but no matter who he went to his worries were ignored. Even Dumbledore all but told him to leave it well alone. Harry knew he was acting like an angsty teen, but for fucks sake he was trying to HELP! So after following Malfoy into the bathroom, and being forced to dodge the blonde's hex, Harry had went all out, trying to stun his rival, trying to do anything to get the other teen to tell him why he had cursed Katie, what he was up to. In his anger he'd used the spell he'd only moments before had read in the book. Sectumsempra. He didn't know what it would do, and he wasn't really thinking he would admit that, so when he rounded the corner to find Draco lying in a pool of rapidly growing blood, he panicked. Uncaring about the damage to the room he dropped next to the blond, trying all healing spells he knew. Nothing worked, and Draco was becoming paler and paler with each passing minute. In sheer desperation Harry had tore the blonde's shirt open and pressed his hands against the huge gash on the other's chest, ignoring the pained gasp. ' Heal! HEAL!' He actually thought it was working, but his relief was cut short as harsh hands dragged him away. ' WAIT! IT'S WORKING! I WAS HEALING HIM!' His pleas fell of deaf ears, and he watched in horror as the blonde's breathing became raspy and weak as he was pulled out the door. He was vaguely aware of Snape rushing past him as he was taken down the corridor, up stairs, and finally into the Headmaster's office. There he was all but dumped into a chair and watched with heaving breaths as the man slumped into his own, burying his face into his hands. ' Harry, do you have any idea what you have just done?' ' I know it was stupid! But I knew he was the one who cursed Katie! I keep trying to tell you that he's up to something! I just wanted to know what!' Harry panted as his mind went in a new direction. ' Why did you leave?! You could have helped him! I could have helped him!' ' Professor Snape has the situation well in hand. What I am more concerned about was why you chose to disobey me' Dumbledore replied. The panic began to subside, only to be replaced by frustration. ' I'm trying to help you! You keep expecting me to save the day and be the hero but you NEVER tell me what's going on! I keep going into things blindly because NO-ONE tells me anything!' ' And did you perhaps think that we do this for a reason? That it is better that you do not know?' the man had the audacity to ask. Unfortunately Harry had no answer, only a growing list of questions that apparently no-one would help him with. With one last sigh he relaxed completely, head back against the chair. ' I know I was stupid. I used a spell without realising what it even did, and I nearly killed Malfoy. I know that. But I also know that I always seem to be alone in these situations. I'm not asking for every little detail, but even a general idea why I was to ignore him would have helped. Can you even give me that?' He watched as Dumbledore clasped his hands in front of him, peering over his glasses at the teen. ' You are still too young…' ' Of course I am. Despite the fact that Malfoy is the same age as me and clearly he has been entrusted with something that wouldn't normally be trusted to a teenager. Despite the fact that Hermione and even Ron seems to know more about the situation than I do. Despite the fact that everyone around me seems to want me to do things that clearly I don't know how to do, because I haven't been told or haven't been trained'. Harry sat up and returned the look. ' I'm just a child, I should be protected from the world, so why not throw me into pearl year after year and see how I do? Why not leave me with people who hate me for being born? Why not leave me completely ignorant to even the most basic knowledge that every muggleborn knows?' ' Now Harry…' ' Don't. I've had enough. You want me to be kept in the dark, well fine. I will stop looking for danger, I will stop trying to protect the world. The next time something happens, I will stay in my dorm like a good little boy, and let the adults deal with the threat. After all, the adults are always right'. Dumbledore looked on in alarm as the teen stood and trekked wearily out his office. That wasn't what he meant at all. He wanted Harry to follow his plans, without being questioned at every turn, not to give up entirely. Before he could call the boy back, his fireplace lit up. It would appear that Mr Malfoy had indeed survived, and used the time Harry was in his office to floo call his mother. ***End Flashback*** And that was that. Harry was charged with attempted murder, a full out trial was held (though he noted angrily that not once had veritaserum, pensieve memories or even an oath been mentioned) and he was giving a lovely cell in a floor teeming with Dementors. To be fair, he had almost killed the ferret, so he supposed he did deserve punishment. But twenty years in Azkaban…Much money must have changed hands for that one, even with Malfoy senior in a cell alongside him. Ron and Hermione had come to his defence, but not much. Both had to admit that he was going against what he was told, that several adults had specifically told him to stay out of it. And Hermione was only too happy to mention the Half Blood Prince book and how dangerous it could have been. He was certain he even detected a hint of smugness that she was right. Nevertheless, he knew he should have received a fairer sentence. But that was in the past, and honestly, he didn't care anymore. His new ability came a little after, roughly a month into his sentence. ***Flashback*** The Dementors were ruthless. Harry hadn't so much slept as fallen unconscious due to their exposure. And when he wasn't out for the count, he was screaming his throat hoarse. He thought things couldn't get any worse, after all he was in a tiny, filthy cell that had seen several people (not to mention their waste) over the years, and had near constant exposure to the Dementors night and day. Apparently he was wrong, as one night (not that he knew the passing of time) he received a new visitor, in the form of Voldemort. The monster had raided his mind, laughing cruelly at his torture, adding to it by pushing images of his victims in their last moments. A week in and Harry wasn't sure what was worse. A few weeks later he had his answer. Hogwarts had been breeched. Dumbledore was dead, killed by Malfoy (so that was the bastard's plan) with Snape watching the whole thing, and so were several students and teachers. Very few were spared, and those that were only had the luck of their blood to keep them alive. It wasn't a very good prospect. Not long afterwards, the ministry fell, and with that came several more images of dead and tortured bodies for Harry to view at his leisure. Rape, torture and murder became daily images. Even the Dementors couldn't keep up. What made it even worse (if that was even possible) was that it wasn't just strangers he was watching. Quite a lot of the victims were people he knew, fellow students, friends. Finally one day, after watching with despair the monster's followers destroy the burrow, and anyone inside, Harry had had enough. Remembering his "remedial potions" lessons, he waited until Voldemort was engrossed in his crucios, and, ignoring the pain of watching one of the Weasleys fall, he pushed back. It was almost laughable how easy it was, and the best thing was Voldy hadn't even realised. Harry would change that, and sent as much of his own mental pain back at the man. The result was, despite the circumstances, very amusing. Voldemort had screamed, and kept screaming, dropping to the ground he clawed at his head, rolled back and forth like a dog, and just screamed. His followers had no idea what to do, rushing to him they huddled together, some starting the motions of raising his wand, before hesitating and lowering it. The pause had allowed the remaining Weasleys to launch a vicious counter attack. It was almost scary the way gentle Arthur tore through the group, while Bill and Ron practically forgot they were wizards and struck out again and with fists until blood was splattered everywhere. The survivors managed to grab their lord and retreat, but it came too late for Mrs Weasley and Charlie. Harry had watched this through Voldemort's eyes, idly wondering where Ginny, Ron and Hermione were and hoping they were ok before returning to the man he was currently invading. He couldn't work out why his gamble had worked so well, until he realised with sudden clarity that Voldemort was little more than a slither of himself. There was more insanity in there than logical thought, and by fuelling that insanity, preventing the rational side from getting through, Harry made it all but impossible for the man to stop him. It was
