Author Note: This is my second hunger games story but a part of a different series, I did have a SYOT but I deleted for 2 reasons, I only got one Submission in 1 week and I find it easier writing with my win characters. In this series it doesn't follow cannon, the 74th hunger games was win by a different tribute and there was a different quell twist. Like my last story I won't be doing a parade or interviews and the victors will be all different, there might be some name clashes because I suck at names but that's all. I also will be doing 3 pre reaping chapters and 3 reapings Brodie Stelen 16, District 7, Victor of the 98th Hunger Games Reality vs fantasy, I know what I would choose, the games were both a blessing and a curse, I don't have to live poor anymore, having to work endless hours for my family but was it worth it, the pain I have to go through everyday, the nightmares I get and the feeling I always get, I didn't derserve to win I was 15, I was naive, a loudmouth and a little awkward, how does a boy like me win, I know my victory was rigged, first of the arena was a wood factory, my district partner coincidentally got blown up by her pedestal, and I was allowed to hide most of the games, I got sponsor gifts, no mutts chasing me, how did it happen? The head game maker, the new head game maker, is my half brother, don't ask me how, he lied about his identity, moved to the Capitol with my mum, then some how became head gamer maker, I didn't know this until after my victory he showed me my birth certificate, he made me win, my last opponent the boy from one, nearly got crushed by wood, that's how I axed his head Thats how I won, I haven't spoken to my brother since, how can I, I used to be poor and I hated getting things handed to me on a silver platter and getting life, I didn't derserve it, I still don't, but I can't give up, my district needs me, the look in thier eyes when I came back, they were proud of me, I showed them hope The other victors aren't happy, they knew my victory wasn't fair, the district 1 victors can't look me in the eye they hate me, the president hates me, he looks at me like prey, I have to be careful one slip up and I'm dead I climb back from my window still, this house is big but pretty much Empty it's only me and my younger sister, I couldn't forgive my dad for keeping a secret from me and he can't forgive me, he didn't want a son who is a murderer he wanted a hero and I'm in no way a hero I get pulled back to my window, when I see a large black limbo near the drive way "crap" I mutter to my self, closing my curtains, president Lucian, he replaced snow 10 years ago when he retired, ever since he had been one of the most loved presidents to this day, he acts kind and considerate when he is doing Interviews, but I see straight through his mask, if he was so caring he would demolish the games, give the district more money but he does none of that When I won he constantly death glared me, he didn't congratulate me or anything, I'm lucky my brother is still alive, I walk towards my sisters room and carefully open the door, she walks over to me with tear stained eyes, I know this is taking a big effect on her, when dad left, she thought it was her fault, and my constant screaming at night is stressing her out "why are thier man with guns, by the window, did cedar do some thing" I let out a snicker, for a 10 year old she is smart, let's just say my mentor has attitude problems, he hated me last year called me a pretty face with no brain or brawn, he has lightened up on me but I know we are in no way friends "nothing for you to worry about, just stay in her" I say patting her shoulder, she nods and goes under her blankets, I see them walking towards my door, I chuck a jacket and try to re spike my chestnut hair, they also think I won for my looks, I'm not that shallow, I hear a knock on the door and I carefully walk to the door "Brodie nice to see you" said Lucian walking in with a peacekeeper and a boy a few years older then me "is everything ok" I say "no" Lucian said sitting down, I sit a little away from them trying to keep myself calm "what was your stragerty last year" he said I bite my lip, what was my stragerty, I had a allie but I got to afraid in the bloodbath and I ditched her, I then hid in a room all 7 days "make an allie and hide" I said "yes, your allie got killed in the bloodbath, and you were very lucky, Capitol woman sponsored you for your looks, while no mutts seemed to attack you when every one else did" Lucian said straining his eyes on me "I guess it was luck" I said "no, what is your relationship with the head game maker" he said I try hard to keep my leg from shaking, I seem to get stressed out easily "I have no clue" I say "I thought so" he said handing me advertisement "What's this" I mutter "win a Victor for a week, a lot of people will love to auction for you, see we treat our victors nicely but you are keeping something from us, see Mabey I do blackmail victors, If you tells us the information we need, you will be welcomed in the Victor circle if you don't then, this is your fate" I can't do that, no only do I have a sister but I'm mentoring soon, I dont want to end my Tribites life because I'm stressed about this "his my half brother, he said he made sure I won, I had no clue about him, I promise" I say "welcome, your earned my trust, this is mason the new head gamer maker" he said pointing to the guy in the suit "new" I question "yeah, sorry about your lost but here, this is a little apology present, do not tell any other Victor only your tribute" he said walking out, I just glare at their retreating figures I look at the envelope "arena" I mutter, what if this is a trick, should I tell cedar, or maybe I should tell Noah, Acacia or Maxin they are the only ones that see through the president, they don't obey him and they are still alive and well, Mabey they could help me but trust is the issue, Noah is a mentor for district 2, a career district he may see it as a advantage for his tributes, Acacia is way too paranoid she may think it's a trap and Maxim he cares about his district too much to help me, I'm alone I have a duty though, I need to help my tribute, I doubt district 7 will win again, but the captiol won't rig the games, I doubt mason will, I just hope this wierd arena won't be to torturous Tributes Profiles- Cyrus Animkin 18, District 1 Male
