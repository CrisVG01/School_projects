Numb. Buzzing. Light? No...This isn't right. No. No. No. Get up, Bella. Get up. No. Light. I should already be up. Numb. I can't move. Push, hurts. Push. Light? "Breathe, Bella. Breathe!" Wait. Breathe, Bella. I thought I was. Bella? "Come on, Breathe!" That isn't me. It hurts. Numb. Buzzing. I breathed, better. Air in. Air out. Burns, numb. Buzz. "There you go, Bella. Can you hear me?" Yes. I don't think I am heard. Air in. Air out. Who's Bella? "Bella, my name is Agent Cullen. Can you hear me?" Yes. I said yes. Cullen, do I know you? No. I know no one. I am no one. Buzzing. "Can you open your eyes for me, please?" Light. No. Yes. I should be up. Burns, oh how it burns. Air in, air out. I open my eyes. Light, I close them. "Come on Bella, that's it. Please sweet heart, open them again for me?" I do. "There we go. I never thought I would see those beautiful eyes again." He looks sad. Hair. His eyes. Do I know him? No. I know no one. I am no one. Burn. Numb. "Can you tell me your name?" "I am no one." I croak. My voice, it's off. I want to close my eyes. I start to. "No! Keep your eyes open Bella!" "Bella? No. I am no one." "Your name is Bella. You are someone." "Bella." "Yes, my name is Edward." "Edward Cullen." "Do you remember me?" "No. I know no one." Burn. Air in, air out. "It's okay. Try to stay awake, okay? Are you in any pain?" "No." Yes. "Agent Cullen to Agent Swan." The man spoke into a small black box. Swan? No, I am an ugly duckling. Air in, air out. Tired. Numb. Burn. "Agent Swan here. I am about 200 yards away." "Agent Swan, please approach with caution. She is disoriented." "She's alive? She's awake?" The little box screamed. I don't want to be. "Yes, she is awake and stable. But disoriented." I look away from Cullen. Another man. Curly. Him. No. He falls to his knees beside me. "Bella, Oh my God! I am so happy to see you! Oh my God." Curly man cries. No. "No." Please don't cry for me. "Are you hurt? Are you in any pain? I am so sorry it took us forever to find you. I love you so much." "No! No love! Please, no love!" Curly looks confused. "Bella, I am not going to hurt you. What's wrong? What happened?" "Emmett, stop. She's disoriented; we are going to get her on the helicopter and to the hospital." Cullen Says. Wait. No love. Please. Air in, air in, air in. Please I need air in. Burns. Fuzzy. Buzz. "Bella, sweetie. Try to take nice easy breaths. I am going to give you some medicine to help with some of your pain. It will make you sleepy and then we are going to go take a ride on that helicopter, okay?" My eyes follow his finger. Buzz. That's what is buzzing. Not me. I don't buzz. I am moving. I should be scared. I think. Air in, air in, air out. Finally. I close my eyes. "Bella, no! Please wake up!" I hear. My eyes are closed. I can hear. "Emmett, its fine. I gave her a mild sedative. She was hyperventilating. She is fine." Emmett? Memory. No. I know no one. Alice? No. No. I am no one. My hand, another hand. Someone is holding my hand. I should be scared. But no. It's warm, comforting. I think. "Bella, you are safe. No one can hurt you now." "Emmett." I am done. I am no one. No more burn, numb. Buzz. Black. Peace. Burn. Always burn. Beep. Pause. Beep. Pause. Beep. Pause. Beep. "Bella? Are you awake?" No. Beep. Pause. Beep, beep, beep. "Honey, open your eyes." Scared. Beep, beep, beep, faster, beep beep. I open them. Curly. Cullen. Cullen speaks. "Do you know where you are at?" That beeping noise is faster. I wish someone would turn it off. But I dare not ask. Burn. I take a quick moment and look around. Light. Breakfast. "Light. Breakfast. Breakfast. Sorry. Sorry. Breakfast." I need to get up. I need to make breakfast. It's going to hurt. Burn, love. The end. No, the end will never come. It will be bad, he had said so. I am stopped by a hand, "Bella, you can't get out of bed. You need to stay in bed for a little while." "Breakfast. I am sorry. Chickens, today. I promised chickens. Eggs. Special. He is going to be so mad. Love is going to hurt. " Cullen speaks again, I look at him. Blip, beep. I feel a pull in my chest. No. I know no one. "Bella, you are injured. No one is going to hurt you." He holds my hand. It tingles. I don't like it. I do. No. Yes. I look at my tingling hand. There is something taped there. I look at it. I touch it with my other hand. Owe. No. My hand is pulled away from touching the object taped to my other hand. "I need to get breakfast or loving time is going to burn." I say calmly. But that horrible beeping sound is getting faster and louder. I pull the blanket down. I am not allowed blankets. Did I do something wrong? This is all wrong. I stop. Air in, air out. Beep, beep, beep. Sting, my eyes. No, tears. No. I will not let them fall. "Something is not right." I say. "Light, breakfast." I am at a loss. I am scared. Someone has turned that annoying beeping sound off. Thank you. But I know not to say it. There is another man there now, other than Curly and Cullen. I don't know what to call him. He smiles, my eye twitches. I know that smile. No, I know no one. I am no one. Smiley. Smiley talks, "Hi my name is Dr. Cullen. Carlisle Cullen. Do you know where you are sweetie?" I am scared, I do not know. "Nooo. I don't understand what is going on." I whimper. Cullen? Two Cullens? No. It's wrong. No. "That's okay. Can you tell me your name?" Smiley asks. "I am no one." I am no one. It's on the tip of my tongue, Bella. No. "You are someone damn it!" Curly screams. I jump. Cullen squeezes my hand. It tingles. "Emmett, that's enough. If you can't control your temper, you will be asked to leave the room until you can. Understand?" Smiley gives him a serious look but smiles again at me. "Your name is Bella. Isabella Marie Swan and you are in a hospital." "Bella. No, I am no one." "You are Bella. I promise you. Do you recognize this man over here?" He points to Curly. "Curly." I want to say yes but I know I know no one. Curly frowns. A tear falls. "No. Don't cry. No." Please. But I can't say please. No, burn. He leaves. "I am sorry!" I didn't want him to leave. "Please! Don't leave, I am sorry! Please, loving time is going to hurt more! I don't want it to burn!" I slap my hand over my mouth, he stops. Cullen squeezes my other hand. I can't believe this, its really going to burn. Curly turns, his eyes. I know those eyes. No. I know no one. Wait, but I do! No. You don't. Culry walks over to me, "I am never going to leave you again Bella. No one is ever going to hurt you again. I promise. I promise to the moon and back." "The moon and back." I repeat. My eye twitches. "Bella, this is Emmett Swan." Smiley says. "Swan. No I am an ugly duckling." "That is not true, you are a beautiful swan." Cullen whispers. My cheeks get hot. Why? I do not know. "Bella, you are going to be given a lot of information at once. It will be confusing. But we are going to help you understand it the best we can. Firstly, Emmett is your brother." I look at him. I know him. No, you don't. I know no one. "I am sorry." "This is Emmett's best friend. Edward Cullen. I am Edward's father, Carlisle." Smiley says. "Alice." I say. All eyes snap to me. "You remember Alice?" Carlisle asks. "No. Yes. I know no one. I don't know." A tear falls. I wipe it away aggressively. I am so confused. I want to say more. I open my mouth, I shut it. I do not have permission. "Bella, you are free to speak whenever and whatever you want to say." Smiley, Carlisle assures me. "No. It will burn. You don't know how bad it will burn. I have said too much. I need to go." "What do you mean by that? It will burn? What do you mean?" Curly asks, Emmett. "Loving time is going to burn. If I am good, it burns less. Please? I don't want it to burn. Loving time is going to burn." Air in, air out. That beeping noise comes back, so loud. Beep, beep, beep. Smiley reaches behind the bed and the beeping stops. "Bella, no one is going to hurt you anymore. You are safe, I promise you. What is the last thing you remember before you woke up here?" Carlisle asks. "Breathe, Bella! Breathe!" I repeat Cullen's words. "Numb. Buzz. Push, burn. Come on, Breathe!" "You heard that?" Cullen asks. I nod. "That's what I was saying while I was performing CPR on her." He says simply. Curly, Emmett's eyes go big. "Am I wrong? I'm sorry!" I panic, I do not want anyone to be mad. Burn. Love, burn. "No, no. You are not wrong, no one is upset." Carlisle speaks, "What else do you remember?" "Agent Swan here. I am about 200 yards away. Agent Swan, please approach with caution. She is disoriented. She's alive? She's awake? I don't want to be." In take of sharp breaths. No, burn. Carlisle looks at Cullen, "Was that said?" He asks. Cullen nods, "All but that last part." "What about before that, Bella?" He asks, smiley. He smiles a lot. I was silent. Burn, that's what I remember. But then cold. Burn. It burned so bad. "Why can't I make breakfast? I need to get back to him. Loving time will be the worst ever. I know it. Burn, oh baby burn." Cullen tugs at his hair painfully with his free hand. Emmett frowns, please don't. Air in, air out. Cullen squeezes my hand again, I notice I am shaking. "Bella, you are never going back there. You are safe. You are going to be staying here in the hospital while we take care of you and get you healthy." Carlisle tells me. I do not understand. "But why?" My voice cracks. "Because those people that you were with kidnapped you and hurt you! They took you from your home, your family, your friends, and your life!" Screamed Emmett. I freeze. No. That can't be. I know no one. I am no one. Burn. No. Yes. Wait. "Bella, stop. I know this is very confusing to you but you do know people. A lot of people know you and you are someone. Someone very special." Smiley again. Always smiley. Did I say that out loud? Oh. Wait. I am done. I close my eyes and lay my head against my pillow. "The end." But I hear. "The end?" Curly asks. "Wait, Bella?" "It's fine Emmett. Let her rest." I welcome the fog. Burn, it will come later. But right now, fog I welcome you. Then, blackness. I hope I stay here forever. I can hear. My eyes are closed. "...fractured ribs, severe malnutrition, lacerated liver, pneumonia, multiple bruising, burns and lacerations all over her body, and..." hesitation. "Just say it Carlisle."
