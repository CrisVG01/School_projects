Sweat dripped down Harry's face slowly, leaving dirty trails behind, his rapid breathing and beating heart were the only signs that he was distressed. His legs aching with each step as hewalked through the darkness, each step he took was as if he was wandering into a black hole. Harry wanted nothing more than for this to end, he after all wasn't living he was just surviving and to Harry that was meaningless. He stopped for a second to check on his wound, blood running down his cheats in a heavy stream. Harry cursed he knew he didn't have long. "Stupid Uncle Vernon and his temper" at least the man would finally get his wish, Harry would soon no longer exist in this world and would be reunited with his family. Harry had tried to bandage up the wound but nothing could stop the blood flow, his only mission right now was to get as far away from the Dursley's as he could because there was no way he was going to be at peace with them anywhere near him when he died. Harry's head had begun to spin, he knew he had only minutes to live; he was losing too much blood to survive more than an hour. Harry only had one regret was that he hadn't done more with his life and that he wouldn't be able to say any words of comfort to Hermione about his death. Hermione was the only one he was sad to be leaving behind, she had always been there for him when he needed it, she hadn't cared when Harry had chosen not to fight for the light, and she had understood and sided with Harry. Dumbledore had manipulated Harry's every move and they had both decided that they weren't going to be puppets anymore. The light had disowned them, the Weasley's labelled them traitors.. Even Ron hated them now. Harry was seeing black spots, he tripped and hit his head on the pavement and there was nothing but black. ********************************************************************************************************************* Harry opened his eyes expecting to be welcomed by his parents to be finally reunited with the people he had longed for most, but he wasn't he was in dim lit room, he clenched his fist into the sheets they were defiantly real this wasn't a dream. Harry looked around the room taking in his surroundings the only thing that was in the room was a cupboard a bedside table and a chair that was placed near the bed as if someone had been watching him as he slept. Harry tried to remember how he got here but the last thing he remembered was running from the Dursley's after Vernon attacked him. Who had saved him? He didn't recognise anything around him so he couldn't be at the headquarters of the order of the Phoenix then Harry soon started to panic what of someone from the order had found him and were going to force him to fight for them. Harry scoffed there would no way he would fight he thought it was ridiculous that they put the fate of the war in a child's hands, he only just finished Hogwarts and they expected him to be able to defeat the freaking dark lord, one of the most powerful wizards since the founders of Hogwarts themselves...yeah right. Harry sat up slowly every part of his body ached as if he had been hit by a train and brought back to life. He pulled up his shirt to check his wound, to find he now had a fresh scar. Harry sighed that's just what he needed another freaking scar. He swung his legs around to the side of the bed, slowing standing, and placing one foot in front of the other in a sloth like motion. Finally reaching the door he twisted the handle. In front of him was a long hallway filled with rooms. As he was about to step out from the room he was in the one opposite him opened in a rushed movement. He braced himself to be attacked as much as he could without his wand. However the person who appeared in front of him had long bushy brown hair. Before Harry could say anything, Hermione had him in a bone crushing hug. "Oh Harry, thank Merlin you're okay". Before Harry could complain she spoke "Harry what are you doing out of bed, you shouldn't be walking around, in your condition" Harry gave her an annoyed look "As if I could rest without knowing where I was, I thought the order was trying to make me fight for them again" Hermione started to shove him back into the room "Don't worry the order weren't the ones to save you" Harry smiled and let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding. "Did you?" Hermione had an odd look on her face. "Hermione where are we?" He sat on the bed sitting up refusing to lie down. "Who saved me? I have a right to know, I now owe them a life debt" Hermione now had troubled look on her face, a battle was raging inside of her she was obviously scared of telling Harry." okay Harry promise not to lose your temper and that you will stay in bed" her eyes pleaded with Harry. Harry nodded "I swear on my magic." Hermione realised that Harry was serious; she gave Harry another worried look. "Voldemort, this is Riddle manor." Seeing Harry's eyes widened and his face go red she explained. " Harry he really is a nice guy, he isn't insane as Dumbledore mad us believe, he thought you were his destruction, once he learned that the prophecy was just Dumbledore manipulations, he put his soul back together and become saner then most people these days". Harry looked at Hermione as if she was Insane" Hermione this is the man who killed my parents!" Hermione shook her head eyes watering "It wasn't him Harry, it was Dumbledore, I have seen the memory with my own eyes." Harry gave her a disbelieving look "He could have tampered with it, I know it possible." Hermione was angry now " I know a real memory when I see one Harry! They don't call be the brightest which of my age for nothing!" Harry put his arms up in surrender "Okay, okay sorry" He gave her a smile to reassure her "so what are you doing here then." Hermione stared at him for a while before deciding it was okay to continue. "Voldemort thought it would be easier for me to be here when you woke up so you wouldn't go crazy." Harry raised his eyebrows "It's true Harry, Voldemort is so intelligent he is such a gentleman... He has been treating me like I'm royalty" Harry laughed at the thought of Voldemort snake like kissing her hand and having dinner having arguments about a book. "He properly fancies you" Hermione gave him a shocked look but soon recovered and she gave him a smile. "Out of the question, Harry Voldemort is as gay as they come; he admitted it when I questioned him". Harry was too shocked to say anything, Voldemort was gay? That sounded weirder then him courting Hermione. Harry yawned so Hermione left him to sleep, with strict orders not to leave the bed before kissing him on the forehead and promising to visit him tomorrow. Harry let his head rest on the pillow and slowly drift to sleep. Harry woke with a start, the door to his room opened, he pretended to sleep but peaked through slightly, it wasn't Hermione, and the person came closer to Harry. Harry's eyes immediately shut hoping the person would leave thinking he was asleep; his whole body was tense as he waited. The person sat in the chair, he seemed to be waiting for something, and Harry didn't dare to move a muscle. "Relax Harry it is simply just time for your potions." Harry opened his eyes "How did you know?" he knew that voice from somewhere but because of there being no light in the room he couldn't see the face of which it belonged to. Harry sat up and put his glasses back on. The man chuckled "No person sleeps that stiff now take these, it will help you heal faster." He handed Harry three vials, which Harry downed quickly having promised Hermione he would do as he was told earlier. Harry coughed the last one tasted like charcoal; he almost spit it back up... Having had much experience with horrible tasting potions from his time in the hospital wing, he didn't. The man laughed at Harry but didn't say anything. "Who are you?" Harry blurted out uncaring if he came across rude, it annoyed him that he couldn't remember where he had met this man before. "You don't remember me? That hurts Harry." He could hear the sarcasm in the man's voice. "We see each other about once a year, come on your memory can't be that bad, Hermione said she told you where you were." With a flick of his wand the man had the room lit, Harry stared closely at the man was the tall dark and handsome type from fairy tales he had neat black hair, chocolate brown eyes, perfectly tan skin, his jaw line was sharp and perfectly fine lips. He was tall and muscled, Harry eyes widened as he realised who this man was. He didn't say anything just sat there in shock. Voldemort shook with laughter as Harry looked at him, "You have hair!" Voldemort eyebrows rose as he stared at Harry, his former enemy was laying I front of him, he saved his life and all he had to say was that he had hair. "Really that's all you have to say." Harry shook his head at the Tom Riddle looking Voldemort. "It's just your appearance came as a shock, you're not a snake mutant anymore" Voldemort scowled "I should have you killed for the way you speak of me however that would waste my efforts of saving you." The older man was silent for a moment before he smirked as he noticed Harry staring. "Like what you see Harry?" If Harry had still been drinking his potions he would have spat it out. "I'm not gay, so I don't care about what guys look like, your appearance is just a shock like I said" Voldemort smirked at Harry "Do not insult my intelligence Harry, I know when people are checking me out, plus me and Hermione have been talking I know everything." Harry glared at Voldemort. "I don't know what she told you Voldemort but she clearly gave you the wrong impression." Voldemort frowned at Harry's words not because Harry was in total denial but he thought saving someone life would lead them towards Harry using his real name. "It's Tom Harry, I want you to call me Tom from now on" Harry thought about it for a few minutes but seemed to come to the conclusion that he owed the man his life. "Okay T-Tom" Harry nodded to himself. After a few moments of silence Harry spoke. "Tom, why did you save me?" Tom smiled at Harry " I have no reason to want you dead anymore Harry, actually I was hoping you would join me... I heard you will no longer fight for the light." Harry knew that Tom spoke the truth he didn't know how, he just knew. "I don't agree with all your views Tom". Tom nodded at Harry " I know to which you refer, those views were due to a moment of insanity my views have changed let me prove them to you.. Hermione has joined my ranks; she is currently in my inner circle... You would be to" Harry thought about it "How about I go on probation, I'll join for a month and if I still don't agree I'll go neutral"
