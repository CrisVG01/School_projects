Look, this is not how I wanted to spend my summer. Riding around in a cramped bus with four, fairly attractive, but completely annoying, band members was not on my to-do list. I planned on going to the pool, swimming around and getting a nice tan. Skateboarding and shopping with my friends. Maybe competing in karaoke contests. Going to the beach, surfing the californian waves. Piper Mclean would be a normal, teenage girl, normally spending her days during the summer. "Dad, is this smart? I know you want this job, but couldn't we pick someone more...tolerable?" I asked questioningly. He smiled at me from the driver's seat. "No, Pipes. It's too late. I already took the job. And besides, Mr. Chase has a daughter there. I know you'll miss Calypso and Hazel, but maybe you can make a new friend." He suggested. I wrinkled my nose, and he laughed. "Dad, I don't want new friends. I have perfectly fine ones back at home. Why do we have to take Perfect Storm as a client? They are just guys with giant ego's. Why did you pick them?" "Because we needed it. Plus, it's not like I had many options. Plus, Chase and I are old friends. I've known him since high school. He heard about my search, and decided to offer me a job. We're lucky that we go this chance." He said, looking over. "You know I'm lucky to take a break from acting. It's tiring, plus it means that I can spend more time with you." He said, glancing expectantly at me. I sighed. "I guess there's that." I said grudgingly. "Yes, there's that." He said jokingly. The rest of the drive to the airport was silent. He pulled in, and I grabbed my bags. Perfect Storm would be arriving soon, with their bodyguard, manager, his daughter and their friend. I don't know why he was on the trip, because he didn't add to it at all. "Pipes, can you take this bag?" Dad asked. I nodded and grabbed it, shutting the trunk and following him into the large building. "So, Pipes, remember. They are teenage guys, roughly the same age as you. Be careful. I don't want you getting hurt." He said, walking through the open door. I trailed behind him, following him up escalators and through gates. He put our luggage down and grabbed the sign that read, 'Perfect Storm and Crew'. I dropped the bags and sighed, crossing my arms and slumping down in my chair. "Are you ready to meet the most loved boyband of the decade?" He asked me softly, grinning. I sulked, my father making small talk. I tried not to be mad at him. It wasn't his fault that his job was hectic. He wanted a break, and this was it. He had been talking about getting jobs outside his comfort zone. Who knew he'd get one outside my comfort zone? I scanned the now open gate, people flooding out at normal rates. The flow ended, and I sighed from relief. They didn't show. Dad frowned. "Did they miss the flight? Fredrick didn't say anything about a problem with the flight." He said, checking his phone. "Nothing. All he said was that everything was fine, and they'd be getting off at Gate 5. Where are they?" He said, glancing at the door. I turned to look as well, and I let out a groan. Four rumpled, crumpled and bed-headed boys exited the Gate, dragging their luggage behind them. Sadly, I recognized three of them. I took my arms from behind my head and crossed them again, pouting as they saw Dad. They moved slowly, one of them yawning and stretching, hitting another in the face. I let out a very unattractive snort. Dad shot me a look. Behind the boys was a tall, blonde, blue eyed man who wore all black. He frowned at everyone, and I suspected he was their bodyguard, Argus. Look, I only know this because Dad made me do a little research to help him get the job, I am not a fan. Behind Argus was a middle-aged man. Handsome, athletic, with intense brown eyes and sandy colored hair, he looked similar to his daughter, who was walking next to him. Her blonde, sandy beach curls were pulled up into a high ponytail and her scary, yet lovely grey eyes on Californian tan skin made her gorgeous. She stopped for a second, closing her eyes and breathing in the fresh, Californian air. Her father looked at her. I faintly heard her respond, "It's been awhile, Dad. I missed Cali. It smells much better than New York." She said, her voice ringing through the air. I watched the boys with scowl on my face, and when they came close enough, I turned away. It felt wrong to be breathing the same air as them. They stopped and shook Dad's hand. I made a face. Last time I hugged him. "Nice to meet you boys. I'm Tristan, and this is my daughter Piper." Dad introduced. I didn't turn around. He sighed, and turned to Frederick. Someone sat next to me. Curiosity took over and I turned to look. It was the girl, Frederick's daughter. She wore dark skinny jeans and black and white converse. Her tee shirt was orange and her necklace held beads. She studied me. "What color are your eyes?" She asked me. I was surprised by her bluntness. "Umâ€¦" "Don't take it personally." One of the boys said. I glared at him. He seemed unfazed. "The first thing she said to me was, 'You drool in your sleep'." He laughed. She kept looking at me. "Um, I don't actually know." I answered truthfully. She looked at me for another second. "Fair enough. I'm Annabeth Chase." She said, holding out her hand. I took it. "Piper Mclean." I said. "So, by the way you glared at Percy, I suspect you don't like Perfect Storm." She summed up. I shrugged, hesitated, and shook my head. "Good. We're gonna be great friends." She said, laughing. I smiled finally. If she didn't like them, I would like her. "Annabeth, you're supposed to be promoting us, not promoting hatred towards us." Percy whined. She rolled her eyes and waved him off. "Luckily for you, it wasn't my words to change her mind, It was yours. Or perhaps, your singing." She teased. He put a hand over his heart, mocking shock. "You wound me." He said dramatically. She snorted and turned back to me. "So, are you native to California, or what?" She asked. I nodded. "Cool, me too. That idiot is from New York. Jason, the blonde one, is from upstate, Leo is from Texas, the latino one, and Frank is from Canada. He's the Asian one." She said. I remembered that. "So, you're coming on tour with us?" She asked. "I guess. I don't know. I didn't agree to this." I said, pursing my lips. She smiled. "Neither did I. But, hey. Welcome to the band." She said, patting my back slightly. I grinned. "Thanks, I guess." I repeated. "Your welcome. I guess." She teased. "Do you surf?" I asked suddenly. She shook her head. "Nah, I wish. I never had time. Too busy with school work." She said. Oh. I thought. She's that girl. "You're a good student, I guess." I said. "There you go again." She mumbled, smiling. "She's the best!" The latino elf, Leo, said. "Smartest person alive, besides her Dad and Mom. Good genes." He said, shooting a finger gun at her. She returned it, her face more violent than flirty. "You're angry today. Wow, what happened?" Jason, the all-american boy, asked. "You four became a band." She deadpanned. They all winced. "Ouch. That hurts. Right here." Percy said, pointing to his chest. "If you're going for your heart, it's on the other side of your chest." She said, turning towards me. He looked down, frowning. "It is?" He asked. Jason hit the back of his head. "Yes, you idiot." "Why is everyone calling me an idiot today?" "Because you are one." Everyone muttered. Leo yelled it. "Hey, guys. Not nice." Percy pouted. "Percy, can you please come here?" Dad called. He jogged over. "Well, now that he's gone, let's talk mean about him." Leo said, giggling in a falsetto voice. "You all are so weird. Let's go, Piper. We'll help out dad's with the luggage, like good little children.' She said, dragging me over to our father's. Percy was chatting with my dad. "Hey, Dad? Want us to take our stuff to the buses?" Annabeth asked. He nodded. "Sure, sweetie. Just leave the boys stuff. They can handle a little heavy lifting. They need it, with all that energy cooped up." He said, glancing at Leo tapping his fingers restlessly against the chair, Jason nodding his head to the beat in his earbud, and Frank bouncing on the balls of his feet. He sighed. "Yeah, go ahead. Here's some money to take one of those golf-cart thingies they have. Load 'um up." He said, handing her a twenty. She hugged him and jogged off, causing me to follow her. I caught up as she stopped at one worker, asking him about the carts. He pointed down the hall, and we took off. "Don't we need the luggage?" I asked. She shook her head. "We'll drive back over and get it then. It'll be easier than having to drag seven bags each all the way down." She explained. I nodded. She was a few inches taller than me, about five-nine. She was dressed casually, better than my ratty blue converse, ripped jeans, old tee-shirt, and rumpled flannel. This was my casual. I tried not to dress up to the name, 'Mclean'. Unless I tell them, people don't usually know that I'm the Tristan Mclean's daughter. "You guy's looking for a cart?" A young man asked. We nodded, and Annabeth gave him the money. He took it and gestured towards the carts. "Go ahead, girls." He said. "Thank you." I said, and we walked over. Annabeth hopped in the driver's seat and waited for me to climb in. She drove off, beeping the horn unnecessarily when passing certain pedestrians. She parked next to Dad, and let me off to get the luggage. I waited for her to get out, but she didn't. "Coming?" I asked. "Can't. If I get out, those monsters will jump in within seconds." She said, pointing to the boys eyeing the cart excitedly. I rolled my eyes at them and started to load our luggage onto the carts back seats. Leo wandered over. "Want to give me a ride?" He asked. I looked at his grinning face. "Not really, no." I said, putting the last bag on and jumping in the passenger seat. Annabeth drove off, laughing at his disappointed face. "Good one, Piper. I already like you and it's been, what? Ten minutes? You know how to make a good impression." She said, impressed. I laughed. "That's nice to know." I said. "I like making good first impressions." She grinned at me. "So, since we're gonna be here a while, let's get to know each other. 20 questions?" She asked. I shrugged, because, sure? Why not? "Okay, favorite color?" She asked. I thought about it. "Blue, probably. You?" I asked. "Um, green or lilac. Favorite sport?" "Surfing. Same question." "Probably track or volleyball. Oooh, or maybe fencing. That's always been fun." She said. "Three of your best friends?" She asked. "Only three?" I joked. "Hazel and Calypso, and Reyna." I named automatically. "Yeah, mine are Rachel, Silena and Thalia, but I'm guessing you have a different question." She said. "Sure. Age?" "17. You?" "16. Best subject?" "Well, my favorite is Latin, but I'm best at Global History. What about you?" "Best at Gym, actually. Easy 100. But my favorite is Science. I like dissecting things." I mused. She laughed. "Yeah, that's fun." She
