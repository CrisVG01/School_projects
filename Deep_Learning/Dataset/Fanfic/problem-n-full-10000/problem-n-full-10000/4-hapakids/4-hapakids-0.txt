A/N: Thank you to my beta for making time to go over this and to my prereader for all of her help as well. B POV It was finally the first day of Fall , my favorite time of year. I started decorating yesterday during our down time. I have garland made of fall leaves on every door way. On the tables, I have mason jars also decorated with fall leaves as well as battery operated tea lights. On the walls, I have wreaths made up of fall leaves with mini pumpkins and cornucopias. One year, one of our regulars knitted a bunch of pumpkins, acorns, and turkeys for me. When she gave me three turkeys, I asked if she could make some more so that they may be used as coasters. About a month later, she brought over about thirty of them. Everyone that uses them loves them. The first thing that I started off with this morning was making my Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies. Ever since I first made a batch and started selling them, they have been a big hit. So much so that I have customers order them by the dozen. Soon after I got them started, Riley came in. He got started on the muffins. We sell Cream Cheese Cranberry, Lemon Cranberry, Pumpkin, Blueberry, Chocolate Chip, Lemon Poppy Seed, and Mini Sausage Pancake Muffins. The Pumpkin muffins are sold throughout the fall season. Riley also makes a Blueberry Breakfast cake, a variety of breads, and his Pancake Bites. Ben makes specialty cakes such as his mini - wedding, cake, sugar cookies. He also makes mini donuts, donut holes, and fondant donuts in various shapes. We also have Apple Pie cookie to go along with all the other cookies we sell. Besides the cookies, I make a Omelette Muffin that is a huge seller. I make a variety of different sausage, ham, and veggie muffins as well as a few quiches. We have fruit cups using apples for the bowls. We are using oranges that are designed to look like pumpkins for this time of year. During the lunch hours, we have paninis, sandwiches, baked potatoes salads, and soups that can be served in bread bowls if ordered. For the little ones, we have mac and cheese, because what kid doesn't like mac and cheese? I also make different shaped cookies that kids love. We have cake pops for the little ones. Just seeing the joy on their faces when they get a treat makes my day more joyful. I love what I do! We open up at five every morning and close by six each evening. We have half days on Sundays. Angela comes in every morning at 4:30 to help with the set up, and she is our front of house person until one in the afternoon. Bree takes over for Angela and helps with the closing. Riley and Ben do a split shift. This way, they can get a nap, run errands, or do whatever else they need to do to get done. I'm usually here all day, but I do try to get a nap in when I can. I have a few couches that the guys or anyone else can sleep on when needed. My downtime or naptime takes place in the back of the bakery where I live. My grandparents helped me start up my business. They knew the person that owned the property. Somehow, the land was big enough to have a cottage along with the bakery and a parking lot. There's even enough space for me to park my own car. There's a electric gate that goes from the parking lot to the cottage with a intercom for those that come to visit after the bakery is closed. Apparently, the person that owned the property was dying and had no other living relatives. They left the property to my grandparents who, in turn, decided to give it to me. Since I saved so much money with not having to buy a place or even rent one, my grandparents were able to help out with the appliances, counters, display cases, and so on. They are even some of our regulars. Once we started making a profit, I was going to start paying them back, but all they wanted was the joy that I got out of it. Instead, they are my silent partners, or maybe not so silent partners at times. I love them, so I just take it all in stride. You see, they raised me when my mom, Renee, died when I was little. I never knew my dad. All I know is that his name was Charlie and that he loved me very much. He was hit by a drunk driver on his way home from work and died on impact. He was fresh out of the police academy when he and my mom met. They were married a few months later and had me. I was a baby when he died. ***Bella's Delights*** Later that day, while I was manning the counter after Angela left and Bree was running late, the most attractive man that I have ever laid eyes on walked in. He had copper colored hair and the greenest eyes that I have ever seen. They reminded me of the forest by my grandparent's house. "Hi, welcome to Bella's Delights !" I greeted him. "What can I get started for you?" "Hi, I'm Edward," he told me in a velvety voice. "Everything looks so good that I have no idea what I want." "Take your time deciding. Just let me know when you're ready to order." Behind him I could see my grandma wiggling her eyebrows while my grandpa was shaking his head at her. I had to turn around so that I wouldn't laugh. My grandparents were too much at times. While I was waiting for Velvety - Voice - Green Eyes to make his decision, I went about making up a tray of some samples of Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies to put on the counter. When I was done, I asked him if he would like to try the sample. He took one and declared that they were really good. "Can I get a dozen of those?" he asked. "I think my parents would like them." "No problem," I told him and went about packing up a baker's dozen. We use boxes for everything because they look much more orderly and attractive in them than just using bags. I rang up his purchase and bade him a good day. Bree finally made it in. Apparently, her study group had been running behind which is why she was late. She takes two classes each semester at the local college. She's still undecided, but she has shown some interest in what goes on in the kitchen. In fact, it was her idea to add the specialty cakes to the menu after she saw Ben make a birthday cake for Angela. "I'm so sorry that I'm late, Bella," Bree said "It's not a problem, and it's not like it's an everyday occurrence." "No, thank goodness it's not," she said. "Why don't you take off for the rest of the day. I can handle the closing with the guys." "Alright you know where to find me if there are any issues," I replied. "I'm just going to go tell my grandparents goodbye." I walked up to them to let them know that I have the rest of the day off and that I would see them tomorrow, but my grandma had other ideas. "Bella, who was that handsome man that came in?" "All I know is that his name is Edward," I told her. "Well, maybe you will see him again," she said. I just shake my head at her. "I'll see you two tomorrow. Try to keep this one out of trouble," I told my grandpa with a smile while pointing to my grandma. "I'll do my best, Bells." he said. "You know how she is though." "Hey, now," Grandma protested. "Love you," I told them and kissed their cheeks. I made my way out of the back of the bakery and walked to the front door of my cottage. Even though it is in the back of the bakery and it's safe, I still lock the door on my way out. I'm not taking any chances. After I let myself in, I opened up a few windows since it was kind of stuffy inside. I walked into the kitchen to see what I could make for dinner. I didn't have much to eat, so I decided on a sandwich. I would need to go to the store soon though. Once I finished eating my sandwich, I had decided to go take a bath and get ready for bed. With the time that I had, I decided to read till I felt sleepy enough to go to sleep. I pulled my pajamas on and got into bed and picked up my Kindle to read. ***Bella's Delights*** The next morning I was busy baking another dozen batches of the omelette muffins since they sold out fairly quickly that morning. Just then Angela stuck her head into the kitchen saying that there was someone there asking for me. "I'll be right out. I just need wash my hands first," I told her as I was moving to the sink. As soon as I walk out of the kitchen, I recognize one of our regulars. He wasn't alone, and it was late in the morning for him to be here. "Morning, Carlisle," I greet him. "What brings you here at this time? It's later then your usual time." "Good morning, Bella," he greeted me. "Apparently, you met my son, Edward, yesterday and my wife here wanted to meet the person that makes the Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies that he was raving about. Of course, I knew they were yours once I saw them. Of all the times that I have been here, I have never tried them, and I have to say that they are really delicious," "Oh, yes, they are. I would have never thought of making those myself. Hi, I'm Esme. Carlisle is always telling me about some kind of omelette muffin, a blueberry breakfast cake, and all of your other breakfast items. He can't get enough of them when he has to go to work." "Hi, Esme, it's so nice to finally meet you," I told her. "Carlisle talks about you all of the time when he is in." "He tells me that your grandparents are here all of the time as well." "They are. They are right over there if you would like to sit with them. Carlisle does all the time. Now what can we get started for you, or would you like a little of everything?" "Oh, can we do that? Can we have a little of everything?" she excitedly asked. "Yes," I told her with a laugh. "Why don't you two go sit down, and I'll bring it out to you. Would you like a mug of coffee as well?" "Yes, please," she said. Carlisle lead her to the table where my grandparents were at. While I was getting the breakfast items together, I pondered about Edward being their son. Carlisle has blonde hair so that meant that Edward got his coloring from Esme. Her hair was a touch darker than his was. I placed everything on a tray along with four mugs of coffee. I then set the tray down on the next table over and unloaded it. "Carlisle knows where the creamers are if
