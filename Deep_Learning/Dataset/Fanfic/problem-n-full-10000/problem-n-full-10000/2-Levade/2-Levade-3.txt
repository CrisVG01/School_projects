Theme: Halloween/harvest challenge for LOTR Community Challenges group Elements: "In a ravine she lived, and took shape as a spider of monstrous form, weaving her black webs in a cleft of the mountains. There she sucked up all light that she could find, and spun it forth again in dark nets of strangling gloom, until no light more could come to her abode; and she was famished." The Silmarillion Author's Notes: Thank you, Ramie, for the beta. I tried to twine together an urban legend with Tolkien's world. Summary: Directly following the War of Wrath, before the Powers sailed West, two curious elves go seeking for something that may be better off left lost. _________________________________________________________________________________ Forlorn " I, Nólaquen, son of the line of Ninyanorindo, do set these words down, that they might stand as a warning. I do attest and swear these were the true events of a journey into one of the darkest realms of Middle-earth.'' One last journey, a last time to see the ruins of what had been some of the greatest kingdoms of our kind in this wretched land, that was what we sought. Young, we were young, we were fearless, for what fear could forests hold for those of us who were Aman-born? We had come to fight in this war, this war to end all wars as the Powers were calling it, but the curiosity that had led some of our kind eastward now tugged at us and we wanted to see this last great kingdom they had called Doriath. What had been so grand as to lure a Maiar to bind with one of our kind? Too young, I was born decades before the dying of the Trees, and so had only bard's tales of what had happened, and then sung only in secret. It was a shame, that rebellion. A shame and a marring scar that the Eldar carried all these years. Now, here we are in this land Fëanor sought so recklessly, and we would see some of it before the Powers sink it, for that is what they have warned us they shall do. Sink it below the waves, below the slumbering seas for this land is tainted with Morgoth's darkness. We do not question it aloud, but some of us wonder; do they sink it to hide what the Eldar did here? Ah, we dare not speak it, barely think it for the Powers can be fearful even as they are generous. "I believe this is the edge of the forest." My companion is a historian, here to record the events of this war to end all wars. Here, with me, to see something that will cease to be in a short time. We are at the joining of the Rivers, where the Aros meets the Sirion. Here, it was said, the Girdle of Melian kept all out who were not welcome. I wonder if some power will keep us out as well? It is clear we are not welcome. The very land speaks its dislike of us, bristling plants with thorns, jagged rocks forming fearsome hills that one cannot clamber over, and certainly our horses would never make such a journey. Even the trees seem to crowd together, forming thick barriers of green to ward us out. Melian may have fled, but the land remembers. And we are strangers to this land, we Aman-born Noldor. "It grows dark. Shall we camp here, at the edge of the forest?" It truly is not a question, for nothing would induce me to enter that forest now, with nightfall approaching. The trees groan and creak as a wind picks up, rubbing and rattling their branches together in a very unwelcoming sound. "They do not like us." "What?" Looking up from his maps, my companion frowns at me. Already he thinks me flighty, no doubt due to the Vanyarin blood tainting the good, pure Noldo in my veins. My hair is honey brown, not the ebon black of my father's house, and my eyes more a light blue rather than the pure grey eye of the elf watching me. "Keep the fire contained and low, well away, and they should not mind." Practical, ever practical is my companion. We make camp, setting up a circle of rocks, dark earth dug away to form a pit, and tie the horses near. They crowd closer, as if they too are uncertain of this land we have ventured into. It is dark. Not the dark of my childhood, when the Trees had died and the Sun had yet to ascend. There is no moon; Tilion is far, far away from us this night, chasing Arien again. We have only starlight, that which my people love, and even they seem distant and cold this night. I shiver and pull my cloak tighter to my body. "Do you suppose the spiders the Sindar spoke of would come this far south?" "Ungoliant's get?" He frowns and looks into the forest, the creaking, groaning dark wall of twisted trees. "It has not been so long since Melian lived here. Yes, it is darkened, but I still feel a trace of her protection upon the land." The water of the rivers flows clear behind us, gurgling and splashing against rocks, eddying about before rushing down, down to the falls. "My mother always said the dark creatures fear running water." She had made the Great Journey and I believed her tales of how hard life had been before Oromë had come to lead them to Aman. Ammë knew more than either my companion or I about this land, though she was far away, in the Western Lands. He offers a smile, a genuine smile, not the condescending sort I had received throughout the day for my tedious questions. "Lord Ulmo's power runs in the waters and so the darkness loves it little. We will be safe here." Here. Yes, between two rushing, powerful rivers we would be safe. What of when we entered the woods? _______________________________________________ Fog crept in during the night, wreathing the trees in shrouds of grey wisps that seem to cling to the branches and the damp cold settles into my cloak, leaving me feeling cold and clammy. Daylight, grey and listless as it was, did nothing for the forest. Dark it was yet, thick and wary of keeping what secrets it held. "We will follow the river still." He is looking at his maps again, ignoring the land around him, the bristling woods and gurgling of water. "There is a branch of the Esaglduin further north that we can follow to get us closer to Menegroth." Menegroth. We had heard stories of its glory from those who had fled the kinslaying of Dior and his people. I pitied those survivors. First to lose their king, what was it they had named him? Ah, yes….Elu Thingol. They had lost him to treachery, lost their queen to her grief and, such a short time later, lost the son of Lúthien and Beren to Fëanor's sons. "They left his sons here in these woods you know." I stare into the dark, loveless woods, cold and harsh and wonder what would drive an elf to abandon children to such a fate? "Yes, I had heard that as well." He shivers as a tendril of breeze pushes past, swirling the grey fog. It moves on to tease the fog around a tree like a grey cat winding around the legs. "Do you suppose they killed them?" Abandoned, they had said, but the words stuck in my throat. I could not imagine such a horror. Not from my own people. Morgoth was the evil, or so I had always been taught, but I was seeing here in this land that my people were capable of great bravery… …and great evil as well. "I…I don't know." Moving closer to my horse, I rub her jaw and lean in against her warmth. This is a cold land. Cold and hard. Perhaps it had not always been so, but now…now I begin to see why the Powers would want to sink it beneath wave and water. "Ah well, let's move on, shall we? I want to see as much as we can before Eönwë summons us back." Another shiver. Manwë's herald had promised. Promised we would all hear the Summons, calling all of us out of the lands before the Powers sank them. I hope he will keep his word. It is odd I doubt the word of a Maiar, but this land…it seemed to suck the very hope from my bones. For the first time I wonder if perhaps what we are doing is utterly foolish. No one had warned us away, or told us not to go. Others were trying to reach Gondolin, to see the legendary city before it too was lost to all time. Leaping up on my horse, I urge her forward. At least we were staying with the water where Lord Ulmo's power ran. _____________________________________________________________ Hemlocks and Beech trees were a welcome change from the thick, dark forests now on the other side of the river. We had forded the Esgalduin at a narrow point and decided to ride on the side that seemed…happier. Not happy, for even now we hear no birdsong. Neldoreth, they had called this forest to our left. Region was where Menegroth was hidden and I had less desire than ever to ride into that dark forest, even as we rode east. Skittering noises came to us near nightfall. Noises I had never heard, as if something huge and light ran through the trees, paralleling us, shaking leaves and branches with its passing "I hear it." My companion stops his horse, steadying her with a few quiet words. Nervous. Even the horses sense there is something in those trees and I am happy we decided to cross the river and put that rushing water between us and whatever lived in that dark forest of twisted trees. Ahead there is a turn in the river, a large sweeping turn where it bends and heads northwards again. We stop there, before that bend, and make camp again. We speak little, my companion and I, instead watching the forest for what we heard. It is too dark, the trees too close, limbs twisting together to form a canopy, to see anything. But we heard more of the skittering noises. The horses whicker at us and roll their eyes, unhappy at whatever they sense, as are we. "Perhaps we should reconsider this thought of finding Menegroth." There. I had said it, the thing that had weighed on my mind since we had first beheld this forest. This great, dark unwelcoming forest. I am not too proud. I came to this land, curious to see what my parents had left. The fact that they had left it meant something to me, chiefly that they had not seen anything so wonderful that they had to remain. He turns to look at me, surprise clear on his face. "But we are so near!" "And whatever is in there is following!" I point, gesturing to the water rushing past. "Only the river keeps them from us." A snort and he rolls his eyes. "My young friend…." I scowl. He is not so much older than I. "…I have not come this far just to turn away before finding that which I seek. Nor would I turn back now and leave all to wonder what has become of Menegroth." "Perhaps some things are better left…" This thing has been growing in me, this certainty that we are trespassing on sacred ground and are not welcome. Whether it was sacred or desecrated I do not know, nor do I wish to discover. "Untouched. Let the dead lay where they are, undisturbed." "You Vanyar." He sighs. "Always so worried about the sacred and such. It surprises me still that some of you came off your sacred
