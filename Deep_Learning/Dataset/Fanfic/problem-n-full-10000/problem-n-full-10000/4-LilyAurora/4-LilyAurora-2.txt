You are mine, Isabella Swan. Forever By LilyAurora o-o-o-o-o Chapter One o-o-o-o-o My lungs burned, as I dragged my tired body across the wet floor of the forest. My fingers were caked with mud, as I dug them deeper into the cold wet earth. Leaves were stuck to my body, twigs had tangled in my hair as I fought forward, trying my best to get away. "Bella," his voice sang through the trees. "Where are you going?" You could hear the amusement in his tone. I dare not look back, but I imagined if I did; he would be stood leaning against a tree, arms crossed against his muscular chest smirk firmly in place, as he watched my feebly attempt to escape. Just as I gained ground a heavy weight landed on top of me causing all the air to leave my lungs with a loud "Oomph," I couldn't move. I could hardly breath. His heavy body pinned me in place. "Please don't," I begged. "Please, just let me go." "You cannot escape me Bella," he whispered into my ear. I shook me head. "You're mine Isabella. Mine," he growled. "No! No I'm not," I argued "Yes," he whispered, his hands running down my body until he reached my arms, pulling them above my head he held them in place, with one of his large hands. His thick thighs pushed between my legs, spreading them apart. I was stuck, trapped beneath a much stronger body with no room too escape. I tried to struggle against him, but he just pushed me into the ground harder. My face pressed further, into the wet cold mud. "I told you not to run, didn't I?" He growled. "I warned you what would happen. I said I'd like it if you made me chase you. Is that it Bella, did you want me to like it? Is that why you ran from me, you knew I would enjoy the chase. That I would enjoy chasing you," His hot breath fanned across my skin as he spoke. "I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Please, just let me go," I begged. He laughed, the sound making his chest vibrating against my back. He shifted slightly. I could feel his lips brush against my ear as he leaned in closer. "I warned you Bella, it's your own fault. You didn't listen. I told you this would happen, did you think I was lying? That I was trying to frighten you?" He laughed again. "I let you do what ever you wanted, since the moment I told you I wanted you. I gave you your freedom, the distance you asked for, just for you to ignore me, to treat me like shit," he growled. "But no more. I won't let you make me look like a fool any longer Isabella, you're mine and I always get what I want," he snarled. "No, please no," I screamed struggling to free myself from under his huge frame. His tongue, wet and warm ran a trail down the side of my face, making me struggle harder. His one hand continued to hold both of mine, as his other twisted in my hair pulling my head back towards him, exposing my neck. "Oh God," I whimpered. "Don't do this, please." "I gave you enough chances Bella, but you threw them all back at me, like I was dirt, as if I was nothing, like I meant nothing," he roared. I swallowed thickly. "You're not nothing. I didn't mean it. I was scared, confused." "And now you're not?" He snapped. "How convenient, considering the situation you currently find yourself in." "Please," I begged my neck hurt from the tight hold he had on me. My finger nails dug into my own hand, breaking the skin underneath. My legs ached from the width he had them spread. He sniffed me then, running his nose along my neck. "I waited you know," he whispered. "Waited for you too see me, but after weeks of nothing, my attempts to speak to you, to coax you into an innocent conversation failed. I told you the truth. I thought it would make a difference if you knew how my wolf pined for you, yearned to touch you, but it didn't. You still ignored me, treated me like shit knowing what you knew." "I'm sorry." "No you're not, you're only sorry you're spread beneath me, weak and helpless. You look like a virgin sacrifice," he whispered into my neck. My breath hitched. He chuckled darkly. "Before this night is over Isabella, you will be mine." Before I had a chance to beg, too plead for my release he forced my head back further arching my back, tilting it to the right exposing my neck further as he bit down. Hard. The scream ripped from my throat as I tried to buck him off me, but he just pressed me against the ground harder, biting deeper, growling and jerking his head slightly in warning. "Oh God," I whimpered, it hurt, it hurt so fucking much. The tears streamed down my face as my fingers nails dug deeper into my own skin. He ignored my tears, my cries of pain. His deep growling continued. I could feel every single one of his teeth in-bedded in my neck. I tried not to move, to breath. He was more than capable of snapping my neck if I tried to fight him, so I stayed still and as quiet as possible. Finally, after what felt like forever he removed his teeth and licked my wound clean. I moved slightly but the large body pressed me back against the floor. Demanding compliance. "We're not done yet, Bella." "Oh no, please not that. I've never, no, no you can't I'll never forgive you. I swear it, I won't please don't," I cried, screamed and begged. I didn't want to lose my virginity like this. Jesus no, not like this. After a few moments of silence, of neither of us moving. Paul spoke. "No," He whispered. "Not like this." He moved then, lifting his weight off me. I could finally breath. I took in deep gasping breaths as his weight finally lifted from me completely. "You will give yourself to me freely, Bella. That I can promise you," he ran a finger along the bite mark causing me to shiver. "Oh yeah," he cooed. "You will be mine." He moved quickly. One moment he was pressing me to the ground the next he was gone. I scrambled to my feet, stumbling backwards trying to get as far away as possible from the figure that leaned so casually against a tree. His dark eyes tracking my every movement. Another step, then another. I was putting more and more distance between us but my eyes never left his. Just as I was about to run he spoke. "I'll be coming for you Bella and no one can stop me." My eyes snapped to his as he ran his finger down his own neck. "You're mine now, Isabella," he whispered. "Forever, like it should be." A sob escaped me, as his dark eyes bore into mine, begging me to argue, to put up a fight, but I didn't. I just stumbled away putting as much distance as I possible could between us, but my eyes, my eyes never left his, just as his continued to watch me. His face placid, his body relaxed leaning against that damn tree. But his eyes, they were full of hunger, full of fire, full of dark promises. Promises, I wanted nothing to do with. But yet it still sent a shiver down my spine, the want that radiated from him. The slow smirk that appeared on his face told me he had witnessed my traitorous bodies reaction. Of course he had seen. He allowed his eyes to travel up and down my body, lingering on places no one had ever been. I continued to retreat. I was too scared to turn my back on him, too worried of what he might do. Fuck! What was I going to do. I couldn't tell Jake. No, not this, he had warned me, told me to be careful. That he was acting weird, strange. Paying attention to me more so than usual, trying to make conversation, just trying to get my attention. The innocent touches, the way he always somehow, ended up seated next to me. I thought nothing of it, told Jake to stop overreacting. Even when Paul himself had approached me. God how na√Øve I had been, so sure Jake was just being jealous and Paul was just trying to use me in another attempt to rile Jake, but he wasn't. I should have listened. To both of them. The distance between us was further now. I could just make him out in the dense woods, he was still in the same position leaning against that damn fucking tree watching me. He was always watching me. I turned my back then. I could see my truck parked outside Jakes. I just wanted to climb inside and go home, hide in my room until all this went away. Until he left me alone. A firm hand on my shoulder as another covered my mouth stopped me suddenly. I hadn't even heard him move. His hard body was pressed tightly against mine. I could feel every muscle, every breath he took. Fuck. I was so fucked. "Don't forget Isabella," he whispered, the hand on my shoulder moving towards my neck, as his rough fingers brushed gently against my tender flesh. My skin tingled from his touch. "You are mine." Then he was gone. My knees gave out as I collapsed to the forest floor. Oh God. I was so confused. My skin still tingled from his soft touch, but my mind screamed at me that this was wrong. He was wrong, but I couldn't help but slightly agree with my bodies reaction, somewhere deep in the back of my mind I had enjoyed it. The shivers, the want I felt as soon as he touched me, was something I had never experienced before. Never. Taking in a few deep breaths, I stood on shaky legs. Slowly making my way over to my truck, I climbed inside, making my way back towards Forks. Where I would be safe, safe from him for at least tonight. The more distance I put between La Push and myself, the clearer my head became. My body returned back to normal, the shivers and tingles passed. Was it something to do with the bite that made me react like I had? Would I always react like that, or was it just when he touched me. God I hoped it wasn't. How would I explain my reactions to anyone, if he touched me in front of people. Unlocking my front door, I threw my keys on the side, making my way up stairs. Charlie was working late so I would have time to shower, see to the damage to my neck before he got home. Stumbling up the stairs I pulled my clothes off dumping them in my hamper before walking into the shower. Turning the water on, I began to inspect my neck. Jesus the bite mark was huge and red but it was healing, it was healing quicker than it normally would have. Maybe that was something to do with it being from a wolf. I could see every one of his teeth. I could count them if I wished. Bastard, fucking bastard. How dare he. Climbing in the shower I scrubbed my body, begin careful of my neck. My hands hurt from where I had dug my own nails into them. Small beads of blood had dried from where I had broken the skin. Wrapping a large towel around myself, I walked back to my bedroom. My head was a mess, what was I going to do? He had said I
