Authors Notes: Ages are mixed up… I made them older. And yes, they still look like gods among men, they just have to work for those muscles. And, while they don't live ON the reservation anymore, they're still all a part of the same tribe; they just all ran in different circles of friends with a couple overlaps here and there.

A glutton for punishment was on the top of the list though as she thought of her recent and horrible break up it seemed. The last four years re-ran on a never ending loop in her mind as she slept in the patio chair on the back porch of her mothers beach house. The bright Florida sunshine had been doing wonders to raise her spirits for the last four days; if only she could steal the sunshine and take it back with her somehow she mused she might be that much happier when she went home. The breeze from the Gulf of Mexico wafted up the Caspersen beach to her greedy lungs. She inhaled the salty sea air as she woke from her nap, allowing its calming scent to wash over her body. She sighed and stretched languidly, trying and failing to shake the negative thoughts from her mind as she was roused from the fogginess of sleep by a woman's quiet chuckle. "Welcome back to the land of the living, baby girl." An amused voice said from beside her. "Thanks mom. How long was I asleep?" She asked. "You've only been asleep for about two hours. It's just past six or so now. I think that's the longest nap you've had since you got here four days ago." Came the easy answer. Bella grinned at her mom, but chose not to agree or disagree for that matter- she'd never win in an argument against the woman anyways. "What's that?" She wondered when a tumbler of clear liquid was passed in her direction. Renee only chuckled. "Ever the cautious one. It's a vodka tumbler. You're already in the bikini you swore I'd never get you to wear. And the cut offs make your legs stand out a mile." She said motioning to her short cut off jeans. "What's the worst that could happen?" She teased. Bella slid her sunglasses on top of her head and leveled the woman with an arched eyebrow and a pointed stare. "You just want me drunk so I'll cry to you again." She huffed, taking the glass none the less. She was thankful they were in the shade now, otherwise she was sure the sun would have blinded her. Washington state was good for many things, having sun this bright wasn't one of them. "You won't do it otherwise. Bottling emotions up is definitely not good for your aura." Renee fussed. "And yours needs work sweetie. So much negativity. No wonder you're so upset over some boy ." She added. Bella sighed and shook her head. She had already said she didn't want to talk about Edward Cullen again. Renee had a hard time understanding the reasons for it, due in part to Bella not wanting to go into great detail about what caused them to part ways in the first place. A soft sigh to her left alerted her to the presence of her step dad, Phil. He merely shrugged and rolled his eyes. She grinned at him to show him she wasn't that mad. It was, after all, her last night staying with them. Her Spring break had drawn close to an end. She had just enough time to see her dad and her uncle too over the coming weekend. "I wish you could stay longer, Bella. I don't like that you'll be going back to a home where you were hurt the way you were. It doesn't do well for your health to dwell in that miserable place." Renee pouted. "I agree somewhat. Florida sun has done wonders for you. You don't look so much like a pale face anymore." Phil teased. "You've got a tan now." He added with a playful grin. Bella had spent a week in the sun, her light skin going a shade darker than before thanks to the time spent on the beach. Bella laughed at that. "That's enough you two. I'll be alright. The friend I let live in my apartment after I moved in with Edward got transferred. She's moving out at the end of the week. Now that Edward and I have separated, I can move back into my old apartment and not have to deal with any painful reminders. "Besides, I promised dad and uncle Billy I'd visit them too, you know. I don't get out to the reservation all that often anymore and Jake and the guys want me to come see them." She said. "At least you have somewhere to go where you can heal. I'm only sorry that something like that had to happen to someone as wonderful as my little girl." Renee told her. Bella smiled. "Thanks mom. You know me, I bounce back. I'll be fine in no time. I have my kids to keep me on my toes." She grinned thinking of her second grade class. Renee only chuckled. "Spoken like a true teacher." "So why haven't you been on the rez in so long? You're always telling us how much you love it there. Did something happen?" Phil wondered after a moment of silence. "I've been busy. I have a class all to myself this year. Now that I'm not just a student teacher anymore- and between lesson plans and papers to grade- there's little time for much else. I haven't gotten to see a whole lot of anyone since school started back after winter break. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again. "Paul's been going on and on about how he wants to use Edward for a punching bag. I need to calm him down soon. He'd more than likely follow through with it and leave Sam to run their shop all on his own while he sits in jail." Bella sighed. Phil chuckled along with Renee. "It's his right as an older brother." Phil teased. "And I don't think he'd leave his business. Charlie has told us its like his baby." He added with a grin. It amazed her how well all her parents got along- real parents and step parents alike. Oh well, opposites attract, she mused before what her step dad said sunk in through her still sleep fogged mind. " Hey ! He's only older by eight months !" She huffed. Phil laughed. "It took you long enough to pick up on that." He teased. "Just because he could rival the jolly green giant in height and muscle mass doesn't mean he gets to pull the ' older brother card ' every time I go through a bad break up with someone! Good lord its bad enough he and Jake put the fear of God into any guy who liked me while we were all in school!" She grizzled. Renee laughed. "Oh honey… I completely understand. You're uncle Billy used to swear he'd kill any man who even looked at me funny when we were teenagers. And there's little over two years between us. You just have to remind him that you can take care of yourself and hope he can understand. And if not, at least he cares enough to want to be your protector. Some step siblings never get along, no matter how old they are." She reminded her. Bella smiled. "I know. Believe me I'm grateful. And Paul is only my step brother in title. That boy is my brother, no other way about it and I do love him. He just annoys me with the protectiveness. And besides, I'll get a chance to pester Jake, Quil and Embry too." She grinned. Renee sighed and shook her head in amusement. "Billy tells me Jake's in his last year of college now. Or will be this coming fall. He's so proud of him. Sarah would be too." Her smile faltered as she thought of her sister in law. "I know I am." She finally said. She didn't want to admit that Sarah's death still bothered her. The driver who had hit her sister-in-law and her brother had never been caught. Because of him, Sarah was dead, and Billy was paralyzed from the waist down, doomed to life as a widowed father in a wheel chair. It just wasn't fair in her opinion. "Aunt Sarah is in a better place mom. Don't get sad on me. We both know she's at peace and she's watching over her family still." Bella's smile was sweet as she grasped her mothers hand in hers. "She blessed Uncle Billy with the strength of character to look after his family even after she left him on his own. He's blessed with her love and the love of all of us." Phil was out of his element for a moment. He respected Renee's heritage, he just didn't understand it sometimes. To him, if a person died, they were dead. To Renee and Bella, when a person died, their souls became protectors… spirits to guide the ones they loved and keep them from straying down the wrong path. He smiled when the girls turned their eyes on him. They knew how he felt- even if he didn't say it. Nothing was said for a minute, they just basked in the peace that had washed over them. "It's getting late. What do we say to dinner and then we can watch the sun set?" Phil asked, clearing his throat some. Bella giggled. "Sure, sure. That sounds good." Fifteen minutes later and the three sat down at the patio table with plates full of hamburgers, potato salad, coleslaw and drinks. When they were finished eating, they lapsed into a comfortable silence and lazed about, waiting to watch the sun set over the water. Her vacation had been spent trying to forget the image of her ex boyfriend, Edward Cullen with some other woman in their bed- a partner in his dad's law firm no less. Four years. She'd given him four years of unwavering commitment. He'd been everything to her: her first kiss, her first love, she had even given him her virginity. In return, he had taken her will to live on her own away- or so he had nearly succeeded in doing. Coming to see her mother had been the first step in learning she could live on her own again. Florida had been cathartic for her. She could finally breath easier. And now that she was on the way to visit her dad in the place she grew up- her home- it would be that much better. (~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~) Bella sighed and inhaled the familiar, rich and heady aroma of the Washington air as she stepped out of the airport. True to his word, her dad stood waiting with a gentle smile gracing his lips. He leaned against the door of his personal vehicle- an older model, black, four door SUV with tinted windows. Thankfully it wasn't his patrol car. She grinned
