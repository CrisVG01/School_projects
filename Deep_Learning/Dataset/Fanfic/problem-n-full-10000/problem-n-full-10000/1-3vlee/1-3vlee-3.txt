***I do not own the Hunger Games nor it's characters*** ***Rate M for a reason.*** Then Cometh Shame Chapter 1 Welcome to District 2 Cato's POV: Finally she gets a taste of what I had to go through with the outlying districts. What I had to put up with. Now she'll know how a REAL Victor is treated at home. For she's just a Seam Rat who got lucky any ways. Who is popular with the masses for now. I bet she won't soon forget what I think of her nor what my district really thinks of her either. Katniss POV: I wish my head would stop pounding. Damn these high heels & Blood blisters. I have yet to see properly for the last two days since Cato slammed my head against the wall & spat on. Cinna was about to bring my pin out for me to wear but I stopped him; "No Cinna not the pin. I want the cross today." Cinna doesn't object but he asks why? I replied; "Because of a relative. This is my signal. Cinna your word, if anything goes wrong you take this cross over to Johnathan Everdeen offices & tell him verbatim this phrase 'Where pride cometh'. He's my paternal grandfather Cinna, he'll know what to do." Cinna agrees to it for his friend since he has had to cover up her bruises from the last fight with Cato. The train arrives, Katniss does her speech to the letter from the Capitol. It was returned with light applause & some even hissed at her. Katniss expected this as she looks up she sees with blurry eyes her grandfather. Jonathan Everdeen knew she was going through hell & Katniss wearing her father's Templar Cross confirmed it. This is her signal she's in trouble. That she needs help & for her to ask is like asking for the messiah to appear. Cato then comes to the microphone there was a loud applause then, he does his speech. The crowd roars in their support for Cato. Cato was going to rub it in to make sure Katniss knows where she stands here. Yet he notices the glassy eyes, the unfocused look on her face. He knows something is up. She's unwell yet, nobody knows but his sister through his escort has invited them to lunch. Katniss declines stating she's not hungry in the nicest tone that she could for it was the truth. Yet the escort & Cato forces her to go. "Fine" she replies "but I'm changing out of this & putting on flats first if I'm walking anywhere." She goes to her room closes the door grabs a black pair of jeans, black t-shirt & flats. She changes quickly getting dizzier by the second, grabs a bottled water to go. Going to the door, everything goes black as she falls with a thud. As Cinna & Cato's sister Lana comes to the door Cinna tries to open it only for it to open partially. His sister yells in a smug tone for Cato; "Yo! Bro need some help here." Cato is now wondering what the fuck is Katniss up to now. He gets to the door notices something different, he looks through the crack to find Katniss on the ground unconscious. Cato has his sister go get help & pushes the door open without doing any more damage to Katniss. Cinna & Cato are on either side of her has they lifted her up & put her on the bed. Katniss eyes crack open when Cinna calls her name. Katniss looks at her friend; "Cinna here. Go & remember verbatim to him. Go now." Katniss's world goes black again as passes out. Cinna leaves to get help for his muse, Cato removes her shoes to find one of the heels bloody. He Looks at her foot realizes the blood blisters have popped & two of them have become infected. Yet knowing Katniss this wouldn't be the sole reason. So he does an examination noticing the bruise from him putting her up against the wall. Then he finds the bump on the back of her head but that was three days ago. She couldn't have hidden it for that long? Somebody would've notice, right. Nope, knowing Katniss she hides things too well & unless as a last resort will ask for help. She refuses help, period. Well now she as from Cato can tell a concussion, fever, infected wounds, possible blood poisoning. His sister comes in; "So what's wrong with the princess today? Can't take the fact she's not welcomed here." Cato flatly replied; "No Lana. From what I can tell fever, infected wounds, possible blood poisoning & a concussion. She knew what was going to happen today. I'm surprised she was able to do her speech as the Capitol ordered her to." As Haymitch & Effie come in they are in shock at what they see. Haymitch asked; "Where's Cinna?" Cato replied; " After we got 12 here on the bed, she gave Cinna her cross & sent him on an errand then passed out again." Haymitch sends Effie to call for the doctor. Haymitch asked Cato; "Was the cross a Templar Cross, Cato?" "What does a Templar cross look like?" "It's usually silver flat, plain but its four triangles that meets together to form a cross." "Would it also have an emerald chip in the middle?' " "Hers does yes." Cato nods yes. Haymitch threw up his hands; "Oh shit, here comes grandpa." Cato asked in amazement; "She has family here in 2?" "Her paternal grandfather is Johnathan Everdeen. Owner of three of the quarries here. Katniss must have prepared for the worse after the little tiff you two had. Cato looked for any handwritten DVDs now & have your sister help." Both kids looked but didn't find anything in the normal places. So Cato looked around thinking out loud; "If I were a small 16 to 17 year old girl from 12, where would I hide a DVD or two where a guy would never look?" His sister's face lit up went into the bathroom where Katniss had her toiletries & where her tampons were. There were three DVDs. They gave them to Haymitch as he orders them; "You two get going to lunch, now. I'll be by your house later or, call Brutus with updates." The two left. Lana cheerfully spoke; "Guess we can tell Mom the house won't need to be sanitized today from the rat infection." Cato then turned on his sister spinning her around & told her; "No but Mom may have to buy her son a freakin casket for his funeral! Happy now sis because when they see that bruise on her neck & the rest of the damage, Snow will make sure I'm DEAD." As they head out Brutus & the escort are informed what is going on & who Katniss paternal grandfather is. Both said in unison; "Oh shit. And she never told you about her family while you were in 12?" Cato looked at them flabbergasted; "NO! She took me to an old shack like house where everyone avoided her like the plague." Brutus asked; "Was the house blue?" Cato replied; "Yeah. Why you ask Brutus?" Brutus faced Cato as he replied angrily; "It was her old house on the Seam you little shit. She gave you a glimpse of her life before she won dip shit. You better pray hard that concussion you gave her didn't give her a blood clot & kill her you stupid little shit." After a short walk to his new house he was greet properly by his family & they in turn were told what happened. Cato father Cain asked; "Are you sure that her grandfather is the Johnathan Everdeen?" Cato obediently answered his father; "According to Haymitch her mentor, yes. Katniss didn't wear her mocking jay pin today. Instead she wore a special cross called a Templar Cross because it was her way of letting her grandfather know she's in trouble & needed help." "I may lose my job because of your little tantrum, Cato. Johnathan Everdeen is my boss & after the treatment a VICTOR in her OWN RIGHT received today he can make a whole lot of lives here miserable." Cato looked at everybody in the room; "How in the hell I'd know she's connected. The only person in her family she'd talked about was her sister Prim. I'm wondering why she didn't go to him for help after her father died when she was 11?" Brutus started to tell him about the real James Everdeen; "Because Everdeen refused to recognized her mother has family. (as both Cato & Cain looked at him) Her father was in an arranged match but refused to marry the girl. So Everdeen disowned him until he married. James married Camille Skylar from the merchant side of 12 but Everdeen refused to recognize her as his wife. Only after Katniss spent 2 days trapped in the mine that killed her father did he come to offer aid for his granddaughter & son. At his son's funeral, Katniss was given his cross & was told if you ever find yourself in trouble & needed him, send it with a phrase 'where pride cometh' & I will find you. The phrase comes from the bible from the book of Proverbs 11:2 'Where pride cometh then cometh shame: but with the lowly comes wisdom.' " Cato looked at his mentor; "Why would they send an 11 year old girl to dig out her father?" Brutus replied; "Because she was the only one who could fit to get the rescue started for the miners. The boys were too big. Katniss had already pulled three of the miners out of the small opening she was able to make & was almost to her best friend Gale's father when the second explosion happened blowing her back trapping her in total darkness for two days. She's never forgiven herself for failing to rescue him. And you still 'wonder' how she got an 11! I tell you this, the train ride this week alone must have been hell for her." Cato's mother Amanda then spoke to the three men in the room; "Well what an interesting story. We can all hope that she recovers from this. Lunch anyone?" Back on the train: Katniss was lying on the bed. Cinna didn't have far to go since her grandfather was waiting right there just outside of the train & had seen Effie. "Mr. Everdeen, I am Cinna. Katniss sent me with this & to tell you 'Where pride cometh'. She needs you sir, now. It's bad. " Johnathan Everdeen came aboard the train & immediately went to her room where Haymitch had the 3 DVDs in his hand. By then the doctor came on board & stated the following: "Hi John, family member?" "James's daughter & a Victor. Marty what you got?" "She's got a bad concussion, fever, & infected blisters on her feet. I going to need to get her to the hospital for further testing." "Marty she my granddaughter, James oldest & a Victor. Spare no expense just like when Prim had the measles." Later at the hospital Brutus had texted for updates at least three times in two hours. Finally Johnathan Everdeen called him; "Brutus if your protégé is so interested or concerned about my granddaughter, he can get his ass over here & find out himself." Then tosses the phone over to Haymitch; "20 get you 50 Mitch he's here in under 10." Haymitch who has been around & knowing what is a steak pulls 20; "I say under 5 John." Four minutes later…. In walks Victor Cato Adams & Mentor Brutus as Haymitch & Johnathan look at their watches "Thank you John has he gets 50." Cato immediately went to Haymitch; "Sorry it took so long we were calling her mother who was delivering
