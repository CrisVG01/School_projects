***************8888888888**************88**** Disclaimer; I don't own the hunger games & all that jazz ***************8888888888**************88**** Left Alone District 13: It's the end of the rebellion & all are getting ready to go home. To rebuild. To start our lives over again as freed citizens of Panem. No more Hunger Games. No more reapings. Katniss just left command's medical when she returns to their (Peeta's & Her) quarters to finish packing & talk to Peeta. "Peeta?" No reply. "Peeta?" Nothing. Katniss looks around but no Peeta. Then it hits her. His clothes and bags are gone. In fact all his stuff is gone. In the middle of their bed a note; "Katniss- I'm doing you a favor. I am leaving you before we hurt each other any more. I realized that although I liked you, I was never in love with you. A couple of months back, I met somebody while you were doing all those propos. She's mellow, quiet but a strong person in her own way. Actually Coin introduced us before she died. We started talking & it grew from there. She was under a betrothal contract which neither wanted. They were going to go through with it for their family's sake. To 'honor' their families. Just like we were going to through the toasting after the rebellion. I know now, that its not what a marriage should be based on. I knew I love her when we invaded the capitol. I wanted to fight for her even die for her. That's when I knew it would be wrong for us to be together anymore. I have no family to go back to in 12 so, I'm leaving to start my life over again with her. This is our shot at happiness & we've decided to take it. Please do not look for me. May you find what you are looking for. Sincerely, Peeta" Katniss just stares at the note has Haymitch comes in. Haymitch sees Katniss crying. Katniss hands him the note. Haymitch sees red: "Sweetheart does he know?' "No. He told me he was going to meet me here to get our stuff packed while I got checked out by medical." "Did you tell him why you were going to medical?" "I told him I was having test done. I didn't want to tell him unless I was completely sure." "No Sweetheart. He knew. Paylor asked if he was looking forward to fatherhood about 30 minutes ago. You were still at medical." "Could it be for the other girl?" "No, Sweetheart. She's not pregnant. He knew. He just decided to leave. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry." "Well the last transport to 12 is tomorrow. I still have to pack. I'll look at my options for our future & go from there." Just then on the news reel Peeta announces our breakup live at the Hovercraft Bay Hanger. Katniss sees him & another girl get onto a transport & it leaves. Yet the girl, there is something familiar about her. Then there is a knock on her door. Haymitch opens it to find Finnick, Annie, Cato, Paylor & Johanna there. Cato looks a little worse for the wear yet in a way relieved as they all came in. Finnick opens; "Katniss the press wants to talk to you." "Fuck them." Cato thought there's the Fire Girl. "Not today Sweetheart. They're going to want to hear your side." "Finnick what's to hear. Peeta left me for another girl. I just read this note after coming back from the do..." has she leaps off the stool & runs into the bathroom & vomits. In the Living room, Johanna just closes her eyes as she realizes what that vomiting means has the guys look at Haymitch who just nods. Peeta bragged to everyone behind Katniss's back three weeks ago, that he got her in the sack. Annie just walks back there to see if she is alright. Katniss rinses her mouth out. She sees Annie there. Still a little dizzy when Katniss trips on the last present that Peeta left for her & hits her head. Everything goes black. Next day-medical: Katniss is lying unconscious in medical where they had to do emergency surgery. The pregnancy was an partical etopic pregnancy. During an ultra sound, they found Katniss was carrying twins but one was still in the fellopian tube. To save the one, they had to go in & remove the other. Doctors informed the group that this is a very high risk pregnancy. Katniss will be on bedrest the whole time. The gang was all there. Haymitch & Finnick were asleep in chairs. Annie was on one side of Katniss & Johanna on the other with Cato. "Jo?" "Yes, Cato?" "If you see Peeta, please kill him before I do. Its' bad enough he cheated on her & took her virginity but Peeta stole my betrothed from me & knowing that Katniss was pregnant abandons her? That's a new type of low, even for him." "Cato, Katniss never told Peeta she was." "He knew Jo. Believe me he knew." "How did he know, Cato?" Annie answered; "He found Katniss's ept test Jo. Katniss tripped over the tore-up stuff animal she got him at the fair when the rebellion ended. It was what she tripped over along with the test with this note. Her last words before her blacked out was 'he knew, Annie'." Johanna reads it sees red, then goes; "Who's going to tell brainless here that she can't go home to twelve for the next 8 months?" Annie replies; "Finnick & I are going to have her stay in 4 with us for the time being. Her mother is there. We can care for her." Cato asks to see the note. At first Johanna refuses then relents & gives it to him. Cato goes from red to purple when he reads; "Go to the real father, you fucking cheating bitch. Good luck raising your mutt bastard, seam whore mutt. Mama's baby, Daddy's maybe." "Oh. My. God. Just last week that asshole was telling everyone who would listen that, he couldn't wait for their toasting for them to start a family. Jo for the love of God almighty please get to him before I do. In fact I'm going to find Brutus's notes." Both ladies; "OH NO YOU ARE NOT ! !" Then there was a small but third female voice that said no too. Has the three looked at Katniss Everdeen who is now awake. "Hi there Brainless. Nice to see you still have some humor there." "Jo, what happened?" Just then Haymitch wakes up to hear Katniss ask Johanna what happened. "Sweetheart, you tripped in the bathroom & hit your head hard. Has a precaution they did an ultra sound to find you were carrying twins. Now this going to be hard so let me explain. One of the babies was an etopic. To save the other baby they went in & took the twin. But now you are high risk & can't go home to 12 until after this baby is born. What do you want to do?" "Well shit when it rains it just pours don't it. You will make a statement on my behalf after I prepared it for the press. By now they probably got wind of the etopic pregnancy. So you tell the doctors Peeta is not allow to know my condition nor that of the surviving twin. Request for Paylor to come here. Then you will contact my mother, pack my ass up & send me to the capitol. The training center has a medical center & its secured. I can stay in the training center suite until I deliever. I can also work with Paylor to help reform the country like she asked." "Are you sure Sweetheart? You hate the Capitol." "Yes & while the press are looking in district after district, I will be taking care of MY child in the last place they will ever think to look while being a incubator. If I go to any district, I'll be hounded & so will you all. This way you all can run interference for me." The more the group thought about it the more they liked it. After Haymitch, Finnick & Annie left Katniss looked at Johanna & Cato. She asked them to be witnesses to her Last Will & had them call a lawyer in. Has they waited for the lawyer they had the TV on. Peeta who was in an undisclosed location looked sadden by the news of the etopic pregnancy. He even managed a few tears. Now as he is sitting there with his new girlfriend, Katniss sees a different side of Peeta. Katniss looks at Cato who just nods. His betrothed, Crystal is Peeta's new girlfriend. Katniss prepares a statement for Haymitch, Cato & Johanna go to get lunch. During this time Katniss finishes her statment for Haymitch & the lawyer arrives. She tells the lawyer what her wishes are: 1) All of her pocessions are to go to her unborn child to be held in trust until it's 18th birthday. Name to be filled in later at his or, her birth. 2) No name is to be listed on the father since he walked out on them. Should the father wonders into this child life, custody is to be stripped from him for what he did to us. (please refer to number four in my will) 3) Legal guardains of minor child in case of her death are to be Cato & Johanna if they can not raise this child, Finnick & Annie. 4) Upon her death this DVD is to be played on national television so the world will know the real Peeta Mellark & the other two to be given to the sitting President to do with has she will. 5) Management of said trust, Haymitch, Cato & Finnick. The lawyer asks to see what is on the DVD so has Johanna & Cato come in the lawyer puts it into the DVD player. The three are in for a surprise. Where everyone in the world thinks Peeta is this sweet soul were in for a shocker. As the three watch how Peeta emotionally & verbally abuses Katniss, how he brought in other women into their place. This was when Coin had her in the field doing propos. Yet nothing prepared them for what came next. When he came in a month ago drunk, slapped her & raped her up against the wall of their quarters. This is how she ' lost ' her virginity to Peeta. Coin was still alive & well aware of the problem then yet made her stick it out. It was after Coin died that during a propo meeting a messenger gave her an envelope which included three DVD's. The other two is how he gave secrets to agents of Snow while under venom high jacking. Haymitch came in when it show how Peeta took her virginity. The lawyer stopped the Dvd & looked at Haymitch. "Sweetheart why didn't you tell me? All this time I gave you shit about loyalty & how you could live a 1000 lifetime & still never deserve him. My God can you ever forgive me?" "There was nothing to forgive. YOU didn't know Haymitch. I wasn't allowed to tell you per Coin." She looks at Cato & Johanna. Then hits them with a bombshell. "Cato & Jo I named you the baby's guardain. No DNA testing is allowed until the baby turns 18 unless its a medical emergency for the baby. Understand? If you can't raise this child, I put Annie & Finnick as back up. Okay." Both replied; "Okay. We got it." Katniss handed her statment to Haymitch. He nods. Her statement is basically Peeta's letter to her with a few of her comments. Haymitch reads it trying not to crack up on the commentary. "Okay Sweetheart, you got it." The Lawyer takes
