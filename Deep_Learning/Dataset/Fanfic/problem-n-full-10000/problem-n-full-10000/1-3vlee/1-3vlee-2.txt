**Disclaimer; Don't own the Hunger Games Series nor, it's characters.** ** Heads up it's not the happy story you think it is.** *Warning rated M for a reason* ***Setting is after the Rebellion. After the first Mocking Jay.*** Return of the Mocking Jay; *Song Suggestion: Mother by Pink Floyd* Coin is worst than Snow ever was, Katniss thought. Coin decided ever since she became President she continued the games. This time with the children of the Capitol. She had told the Victors that the one after the Rebellion was the last one. She even told that to the Capitalist. Ha! Not that it matters anymore. She lost it all in the Rebellion as the Mocking Jay. She lost it all. Her family, pride, the love of her life, all of it gone. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. This is her story of uniting Panem. My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am the Co-Victor of the 74th & 75th Hunger Games with Peeta Mellark. Or I should say the late Peeta Mellark. That will come later. We fought the Rebellion together to end the oppression in the districts from the Capitol Under then President Snow. To free the District born children from being reaped for slaughter. Now we find out that Coin is worse than Snow ever was. But against the capitol born, against the Victors who didn't want the games any more. That's how I lost Peeta. He voted no. I voted yes for Prim. Those who voted no met with 'accidents'. Peeta was the first for he was that out spoken against the games. God I wished I had listened to him. This was Coin's way of teaching me a lesson. I could've told her it was too late. After my Prim was killed by the bombs she used to end the rebellion, when I voted for the games, I lost Peeta. Coin just did to break me even further. She thought she did. I gave that impression has the dumb bitch told me it was my fault for Peeta's death. Like Haymitch & the remaining Victor's, we bided our time. When she killed Peeta during the rebuilding of 12 with that explosion, she killed my humanity or, what was left of it. Now I sit & wait. I give Coin five years on the outside...Tops. Two almost Three Years Later: Haymitch walks in: "Sweetheart it's time" as I look out the window remembering what the boy from Two said on top of the horn during our final battle. That he didn't realize he was already dead until then. When he was on top of that horn with Peeta in that head lock choking the life out of him. Now she is going back in "for them"." To make their deaths, their sacrifice count. The Victors moved their 'party' under the guise of 'arena ' survival training to 12. Coin didn't even bother to even keep track of any of the training or the 'progress' reports that we sent her. But Paylor did. She's been biding her time too. To take over. She knew Coin was going insane with power & what Coin was planning next would have secure another rebellion for certain. Paylor would intercept the reports & edit to suit Coin's need for 'compliance' with her Victors. So she thought. Katniss was in the cemetery. Asking Peeta for forgiveness again. To forgive her for being wrong. To forgive her for what she is about to do. To forgive her for not dying in the 74th arena so he would be the Victor. Haymitch always loved him best & he was right. Peeta was the better person, the better Victor. Unlike most days where there was no answer, today there finally was. It was from Peeta; "There is nothing to forgive Katniss. You didn't do me wrong. She did. Don't look for me here. Now go kick Coin's ass to stop the games forever as it was meant to be. That's what we fought for. After that look for me where it all began for your salvation. You'll know what to do." With that his voice was gone. Gone again is what was left of her humanity. It sadden her for what she is about to do but not to the person that she was going to do it to. For where Coin thought the Mocking Jay was the voice of the rebellion. There was a more covert role for this hybrid. The Mocking Jay was the voice of Justice in an unjust world. For two years now the Victors trained for this night. On the third anniversary of the rebellion, they send in 24 more children to fight for their lives. Yet on the night of this one Coin wanted the 'Mocking Jay' to light the rings of fire. After all she was known as the 'Girl on Fire'. The plan was when Paylor goes to the Victors & nods that is the signal. Paylor will make sure the guards will stand down. After all she trained them. Since Coin will be under the rings on a platform above everybody, she will be in the cross hairs. When Coin gets on 'her' platform, it will be armed with enough electricity to keep her there. When Katniss's arrow hits the rings any of the rings, is when Coin dies in an 'accidental' explosion like many of the Victors that had accidents because of her. Katniss returns home packs for the trip to the Capitol. She was ordered to escort the Tributes to the Capitol after they were reaped for this games season. Yet this year she is taking something that has a little more meaning with her to the Capitol. She's taking her father's Walnut bow & Mocking Jay feathered arrows. She gets ready for bed & goes to sleep. Again the dreams are not peaceful as she is in the 74th arena. On top of the cornucopia, hearing Two's words again & again. During the tour she learned that his name was Cato Hadley. Like her he was 16 years old & that had siblings. His parents were proud of him that he was a "Volunteer". We knew them as "Careers". Katniss learned later at the banquet from Brutus that a "Volunteer" was actually a student who trained for the games so that a younger child wouldn't have gone into the arena. She also learned that is why in District Two, their victors are treated like heroes almost like gods. In Cato's reaping he 'volunteered' for a 12 year old boy by the name of Mason. A sweet freckled faced red headed kid. Like Prim, he wouldn't have lasted ten seconds after the buzzer went off. I guess that was District Two's way of telling the government f-you. After the third round of nightmares she gave up on sleep. Katniss got up took her stuff to the door, went to the window seat sat there & waited for the dawn to get the Tributes to the train. It was where Haymitch, Finnick & Johanna found her. In her fathers Jacket, holding onto his bow asleep. Two Days Later, Tribute Parade, Capitol; The crowds are clamoring in to take their seats after the Peace Keepers swepted the area for bombs. Yet they did not sweep the President's platform area after Paylor ordered them not to. Paylor informed them that 'her' team already did & they would get false readings from the flammable material of the rings above. The Tributes are being prepped by their stylist while their Mentors & Trainers are getting ready for the parade. During all this there is one who takes it all in. Has she is getting prepped, Paylor gives her instructions on the shot; "Just hit any one of the rings. Even skimming the ring & it will light. That's all you need to do." Katniss will be riding the 13th chariot this year. She just nods to Paylor knowing what will happen after its over. She hopes she is just brave enough to do what she has to do. However what Katniss didn't know if she misses, there is another in the President's box who will light it. It's his way to atone for the parachute bombs he designed that was used in the Capitol all those years ago by President Alma Coin. The ones that caused the death of the children who were used as a human shield & the medic Primrose Everdeen. Later that evening; The chariots move out. With each one that crosses that threshold, Katniss remembers how Coin admitted to her that she ordered Peeta & all the other Victor's deaths. " I liked Peeta. Too bad I had to get rid of him & the others. Yes Girl on Fire I ordered his & the others 'accidents'. they were getting 'too' vocal & were about to start another rebellion. Who the hell did he think he was anyways? Telling me the games were wrong. I hated to do it. I really liked him. I wanted him to be part of my government but noooo he had to be this self righteous ass." (end of flashback) Soon enough it was her turn has she pulled out her fathers Bow & noched her arrow has she went through the double doors. In the stands Haymitch mutters; "Come on Sweetheart. Just shoot straight & land that thing." Finnick & Johanna look to Katniss as if to give her the extra strength she needed. To remind her what Coin did to Peeta, Enobaria, the others who opposed her but most of all to Annie. Even for Coin, what she did to Annie was extremely cruel. After Annie gave birth to Lil Finnick, Coin arranged for her to be a victim of a break-in while Finnick was at meeting at the Capitol. Annie was repeatedly raped & her throat was slashed by Coin own guards. It was Johanna who found them Lil Fin screaming his lungs off & what was left of Annie. Finnick never fully recovered from it. It was also the other reason why she became the Mocking Jay again. Katniss overheard two of the guards bragged about it & who ordered it. She decided then & there to hunt each of the rapist down for her form of justice before she gets Coin. So she hunted them down one by one. Katniss would kidnapped them, have them repeatedly raped like Annie was before killing them. The first one was found on Coin's doorstep with a message; 'I know what you did to Annie, bitch. Picking them off one by one. One by one before I come for you.-hugs.' With each one she would tortured them even worse just to send a message to Coin. Has they confessed including who ordered it, Coin got more nervous according to Paylor. Even to this day when Katniss goes to District Four, she goes to pay her respects to Annie, first. Also to beg for her forgiveness for her lack of courage. Tonight though it about justice for them, for the children she used those parachute bombs for & for her little duck, Prim. Tonight she will be Alma Coin's executioner Underneath Coin, Gale Hawthorne has a torch ready & is waiting to light the fuse for the rings and blow the platform. He also knows its a suicide mission. Once this blows, he'll be free of Panem & what he did to Prim. Katniss knows nothing is left to chance as she sees Gale underneath. She touches the tip of the arrow to the small heat source in the front part of the chariot lighting the tip until it crackles with fire. The crowd roars as she pulls back... And lets loose her arrow as Coin's platform rises. The arrow hits center right above Coin who narrows her eyes to snake like slits at Katniss. Katniss gives her a snide look back has she gives Coin a message; "You don't own me
