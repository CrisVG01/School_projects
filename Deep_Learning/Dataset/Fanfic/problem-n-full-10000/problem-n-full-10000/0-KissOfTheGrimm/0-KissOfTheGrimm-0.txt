Her astute mind was running a mile a minute, trying to figure out what had happened. Well, she knew what had happened. She had sex. But for the life of her, Hermione couldn't figure out when or with whom. Since the most recent and final downfall of Voldemort; Hermione, Ron, Harry and all their friends had been slowly putting their lives and wizarding society back together. Hermione couldn't speak for others, but sex had taken a backseat for her. The last of the Death Eaters were being rounded up and judged for their crimes against humanity and wizarding society alike. Their days were filled with rebuilding Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and Hogwarts herself. Every stone that was replaced was one step closer to healing. Hogwarts was nearly finished, the astronomy tower the last piece to be repaired and just in time for the new term. The trio had been residing at number 12 Grimmauld Place since the end of the war. They all had their reasons for being in the gloomy and confining house. Harry was still coming to terms with all the people who had been lost. He attended their funerals day after day but couldn't seem to look their families in the eye just yet; he still blamed himself. Ron was both escaping the memories of his lost brother Fred, and the suffocating arms of his mother. Mrs. Weasley was still in mother bear mode, afraid to let even Charlie out of her sight. And Hermione well, she was hiding from the world, but most of all, her parents. A scant three weeks earlier Hermione had apparated just outside her parents' home in Australia. From the road she could see into the house through a kitchen window, where her father and mother were dancing. Her mother was laughing as her father twirled her around and Hermione had never seen such a look of freedom or devotion on her father's face. Australia seemed to be agreeing with them. They had settled in, bought a house and looked to be happier than ever. Before she thought better of it, Hermione disappeared with a little pop. There had been no guarantee on fixing their memories anyway, why should she put them all through the pain? After that she had holed up once more within the dreary house, not seeing, let alone dating anyone. With a groan, Hermione leaned her head back to the wall, her eyelids falling shut. Though the floor was cold her temperature was skyrocketing; body was on fire, and her breaths were coming in short gasps. Merlin, was she panicking? Hermione's eyes flashed open, and she pushed herself to her feet, determined to get to the bottom of this. Hermione tossed the muggle pregnancy test into the box, along with the three others she had used. Then in the trash they went. Swiftly and silently Hermione walked down the second floor hall. She wasn't worried about the boys but in fact Kreacher. Somewhere along the line he had warmed up to all three of them but enjoyed sneaking up on Hermione in particular. Especially in the morning when she was still wearing her pajamas. Kreacher always took the time to tell her that it was very inappropriate for "such a well behaved mudblood" to be sleeping in the boxers and quidditch jerseys that she stole regularly from Ron and Harry's laundry. Hermione couldn't help the sudden snort. Half the time she slept naked and only wore those items to leave her room. Running her hand through her wild hair, she took the flight of stairs two at a time and headed toward the kitchen. As soon as Hermione strode past the slightly ajar library door, she froze. It was as if time slowed to a crawl as a shock ran down her spine. Hermione reached out a pale and shaking hand to push open the heavy inlaid doors. Stepping inside her favorite retreat, her gaze immediately zeroed in on the low but warm fire that burned in the hearth. Then to the black leather settee in front of the hearth. Forgotten memories flowed over her like water over rocks. ***************HP***************** The sitting room of number 12 Grimmauld place was full to the brim. Sette's and pillows had been transfigured from horrendous looking statues and door stops. There was alcohol aplenty and every few minutes, new names were said in the silence, a small toast for their large sacrifice. Hermione lay on the floor in front of the fire, whiskey in one hand and the other playing in Harry's unruly black hair, where he lay on his back in front of her. Ron was glued to her side, his head and chest laid across her back, as if she were a pillow. Hermione took a glance around at the other occupants of the room. Professor McGonagall and the new Minister Shaklebolt occupied one settee, while next to them sat Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Charlie, and Bill. Ginny sat at Bill's feet, George's head in her lap as he stared unblinkingly at the ceiling. Andromeda Tonks lay reclined in a large armchair, her grandson and Harry's godson firmly seated and asleep at her breast. Earlier that evening, Mrs. Weasley had made a fine supper and invited their friends and family. Slowly after dinner, it had dwindled down to just them. Knocking back the rest of her whiskey, Hermione grimaced and wiggled. " Ron, get off. I have to pee." Instead of moving like any decent person, her large red haired friend, just wiggled and firmly seated himself on her back. " What was that 'mione? You have to pee?" Harry looked at Hermione, a shadow of a smile on his face. Hermione rolled her eyes and said "Yes Ronald, I have to pee." Without warning, Hermione rolled away from him, knocking his chin with her hip. " Ow!" Chuckles went through the somber room, as she pushed herself to her feet, straightening Harry's jersey and Ron's atrociously orange Chudley Cannon boxers. Smiling she said "Be back in a few." Hermione's neon blue socks padded across the many throw rugs on the floor as she headed toward the second floor loo. Why there wasn't a loo on the first floor was beyond her. As she walked past the library, Hermione stopped and backtracked. Who was in her library? Slowly she eased the heavy ornate door open and slipped inside. There on her favorite leather settee lay a large imposing shadow, brandy glass in hand. The ice inside clinked as the bearer took a full swallow of the golden liquid. " Spying are we Miss Granger?" The sudden question made Hermione jump, her right hand clenching reflexively on a wand that wasn't there. " Professor Snape I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I was on my way to the loo and saw the door was open." Severus Snape raised an eyebrow as she came around the front of the settee. "Did you now? Well, I should have known. This being your second home." Hermione just nodded, unsure of what to say. Snape hadn't berated her or insulted her yet and he always took full advantage of any chance he had to disparage her need for knowledge. " Professor, are you alright?" Hermione's eyes were glued to the hand that raised the small glass to a pale, sensuous mouth. Pulling her gaze away, Hermione shook her head. " Something wrong Miss Granger? Surely not." Hermione raised her face, looking Severus in the eyes. " You first." The potions master chuckled. The sound was rough and had a mocking edge that made her shiver. It was a voice of sin, bitter and enthralling. Finishing off his drink. Severus let his arm fall toward the floor, dropping the glass cylindrical object. It rolled toward the hearth, firelight glinting off it in a myriad of colors. Hermione sat down on the plush rug in front of the fire and looked at Severus, waiting. Severus snorted and shook his head, his gaze roaming the ceiling. " The Wizengamot in all its wise nature has brought me up on "assisted suicide" charges" he drawled. Hermione's eyes widened a fraction. " What?" A hollow laugh escaped Severus's throat as he continued. " They cleared me of murder and instead bring up "assisted suicide" charges. Why do they insist on making my life hell even after the Dark Lord has already done so?" Hermione was dumbfounded. Assisted suicide charges? She had heard of them in the muggle world but here? Without warning, Severus swung his legs to the floor and stood in one motion. Hermione quickly scrambled back out of the way. Upon seeing him unbuttoning his outer robe she stuttered, "What are you doing?" Severus never paused in his ministrations as he looked down at her. " What does it look like Miss Granger? Ten points to Gryffindor if you can get it right. No? Well I am getting comfortable. I am sure Minerva plans to get drunk and I must be here to escort her back to the castle. Don't want her splinching herself do we? I have a very strong feeling that I will be here all night." One elegant hand tossed the robe onto the back of the settee as he sat back down. Hermione continued to watch as he began unbuttoning the collar of his dress shirt, expertly flicking buttons through their holes. Hermione's eyes were riveted to his left forearm as long fingers pushed the silk up revealing the Dark mark; a sharp contrast to Severus's alabaster skin. Off came the loafers next, to reveal bare feet, no socks. As he laid his head back, Severus snapped his fingers. Instantly the glass was back in his hand and refilled with both ice and brandy. Hermione smiled to herself, wondering how much of that he had ingested. " Comfortable Professor?" " Quite, Miss Granger." Lifting his head, Severus took a draft from his glass and sighed. He had best get comfortable. It looked as if Minerva wasn't leaving any time soon, crafty old battle axe. Slowly Hermione stood, straightening her clothes. "Do you need anything? Anything I can get you?" Severus looked at her, his eyes glinting in a predatory manor. " Actually Miss Granger, there is." Suddenly Hermione realized how close she was standing to him. With the way he looked at her, she was suddenly unnerved. " What is it that I can get you?" Severus stared at her for a moment before growling, "You." Before Hermione knew what had happened, Severus's hand snaked out and grabbed her jersey, yanking her between his legs and onto his lap. Distantly, Hermione heard the brandy glass shatter, tinkling like chimes. The second her lips met his, a shocking sizzle went down her spine. Reaching out for balance, Hermione's hands found his shoulders, gripping them hard. She wasn't sure whether she should push him away, but when his arm wrapped around her back like a vice, pinning her too him, Hermione decided she didn't care. The witch gave into the kiss demanding from him what he took from her. Her dainty hands moved from his shoulders to his neck and further up to entwine in his silky locks. Harry and Ron had never listened when she pointed out, that most potions fumes made hair greasy. Boldly, Hermione moved her knees to each side of Severus's hips and raised herself up, breaking his hold and the kiss. She looked down into his face, searching his eyes for anything to make her leave. But the truth was, even though she knew she should, she didn't want to. Suddenly he grabbed her body and with
