Seth's Story Chapter 1: Some Weird Things…. Disclaimer: I don't own anything. Stephanie Meyer owns it all. Drew's POV "Artemis, hurry up, you'll be late for practice," my best friend calls through my window. I roll my eyes and grab the bag with my soccer gear. "Shut it, Clearwater! I told you to call me Drew, you know, like everybody else in their right mind," I say to Seth before hopping through my window. I don't feel like going through the long questioning that happens every time I go near my front door. "It's my name for you. I can call you it because you love me," Seth teases while shoving my shoulder. This sparks a memory in my head… ************************************* FLASHBACK********************************* Six year olds Seth and I are panting and hiding in our secret spot. My mother stomps in search outside of their cubbyhole that she knows nothing of. She yells for me, making young me jump. Seth tries to calm me down, so he grins at me. "That was a close call, Agent Artemis Moon," he said, making me smile back at him. No matter how down I get, Seth can always pull me out of my gloom. "I agree, Agent Hot stuff," I respond, giggling. My smile wipes away suddenly. "Hey, how come you get a nick name and I don't?" "Okay, I'll give you one," Seth says while thinking. "No, you chose your name!" I whine. "Okay, I have an idea. We will be best friends forever and ever. We can each make a name for each other because I love you," I said, my young innocence shining off my face. "Gross, I don't love you," Seth cringes away in disgust. I laugh and say, "Ewe! You have cooties! I love you, just not like that. You should have been…my brother!" "Then I love you too. Let's make a pact; best friends for life?" Seth agrees. I nod and spit on my hand and hold it out to Seth who does the same. We shake and burst out laughing. "How about you change your name to Drew like you always wanted to. Then, only I will call you Artemis." Drew is my middle name, but I have always loved it more than Artemis. "Okay and your nick name will be Wolfe because you love Wolves," I squeal. Drew, I think, it is just right. **************************** END OF FLASHBACK ************************************ "Dude, I should call you by your nick name then," I say. Seth was such an arrogant little kid. Who would nickname themselves Hot stuff? Silly Seth! I stop walking and crouch down like I am calling a dog. "Come here Wolfe, come here!" I say this in the annoying voice people use to talk to their pets. I stand and ruffle Seth's hair. "That's a good boy!" Seth ducks his head under my hand and chuckles. "Always have been on the slower side haven't you?" Seth asks jokingly. "Yes, that's why I play left forward on the boys soccer team," I say as we keep walking to our field. He smiles; probably thinking of the day when I demanded I got to try out for the team. The problem with being a girl on the reservation is that the school is small and they don't have enough girls to make a girls' soccer team, so I just joined the boys' team; I am plenty good enough; I even start. Seth has always considered me as one of the guys and that's the way I like it. Although, I am not like most of the girls you always hear about who plays on an all boys' team. I actually wear make up and dresses. I paint my nails and curl my long brunette hair. The thing that makes me different than most girls who are all frilly and jumpy is that I hate all of those things. I hate to shop or actually go to the salon; I just paint my nails and wear dresses if I have them. I normally dress like one of those badass biker chicks, so when I wear a dress it is normally black or punk, something that goes along with my attitude. I put little thought in my outfits, but I make sure they speak my mind. I don't care to watch a wrestling match on the weekend or, when we were younger, roll in the mud. My interests are just like a boy's interest. Seth's favorite thing of me is I love sports - watching them, playing them, and even coaching them. Seth doesn't look where he is walking and bumps into me, shoving us both on the ground. "Seth, do that again and I will slap you," I grumble, shoving Seth off of me. Of course, Seth always distracts himself whether he is talking or not. Most of the time Seth is talking. "Sorry, you make a good cushion by the way, Drew," Seth says while winking at me and making me roll my eyes. "Come on, I'll race you to the bleachers!" "Oh, you are going down, Clearwater," I say with a sly grin. "In your dreams, Moon," Seth says. Whenever we are competitive we tend to slip into using our last names. I will sometimes just call Seth by his last name in a way to annoy him. We crouch down and he says, "Go!" I am in the lead since I start off like a rocket. Seth, being our mid-mid field player, always has amazing speed and stamina, but tends to start slow. In the end, Seth beats me by a hair and we don't notice huge mountains standing in our way. Oh, wait; they are actually living people who just feel like mountains. Jared Cameron, their leader while at school, turns around when Seth hits him square in the back. For an odd reason, Sam Uley is here as well. Sam has already graduated, but he is the leader of their group when they aren't in school. Seth and I call them a cult. They certainly act like one. "Sorry, we didn't see you," Seth says, flashing an embarrassed smile. "Just watch it, kid," Paul Lahote sneers. They are a few grades above us. I am a freshman, as is Seth. I hold my tongue, wanting to kick his butt. I may have been able to before he 'changed', but now he'd squash me like a bug. I have always been good at fights, for a girl, but I am not what people call skilled; more like lucky. Seth always jokes, saying I am a street fighter who knows how to survive but not excel. I never fight on the streets or anything. I am known to have a temper and every now and then, one of the girly girls ticks me off. They are normally not looking for a fight and go down in seconds. I have been in a few fistfights, none too serious, but Seth tries his best to keep me out of them. Seth knows he should have helped me in the past situations, but I get mad when he intervenes on my 'business'. Seth and I brush past the bulky guys and hurry toward the locker rooms. I notice Sam keeps staring at Seth, not a good sign, but I brush it aside. "What is up with those guys? They look like they've gone on steroids, especially that Paul Lahore ," I whisper to Seth, purposely messing up his name. Seth chuckles, "I guess they are a cult, but I've never really seen them doing anything bad. Don't let those rumors get in your head, Drew." I know he is right. That's Seth, always looking on the positive side of things. I think that's what keeps me from blowing my top. Seth pushes his way into the guys' locker room while I go into the girls'. It is really unnecessary for me to even go to the locker room. I never change unless the game is straight after school, but the boys seem to find too much trouble by changing at their house. I am on the Junior Varsity team but am still considered a 'captain', even though Couch doesn't officially pick them for JV. Seth and Matthew, our goalie, are the other 'captains'. At the field, Matthew gives the team instructions of what Coach talked to us about after yesterday's practice. Mostly every day for JV, the 'captains' run the practice. After our Friday game, he pulls us three to the side and explains exactly what he wants us to do everyday. He runs the Monday practices, though. It is always my job to inform them of the pro's and con's of last night's game, informing each player of their mistakes and finishing them with one compliment so they don't feel like I hate them. It is Seth's job to pump them up before every game, one of the many things he is good at. Matthew and Seth go over the weekend schedule every Saturday and Matthew continues to tell them any other info. This is a system. The problem in the system, you may ask? Matthew takes forever to explain things. "I bet you twenty bucks that he repeats what color to wear to the game twice," I whisper to Seth, making him grin. "You're on. He did that last week, no way will he do it again," he whispers back. "Exactly why he is so predict-" I begin but get cut off. "Are you two done over there?" Matthew demands. They may be captains, but Seth and Matthew hate each other. That is saying a lot considering how nice Seth is. "We were talking strategies," Seth lies. "Yeah, just like last time," a guy whispers. I shoot him a death glare, which shuts him up quickly. The rest of practice is a bunch of drills to get everybody in shape and performance ready. At times, I wish we had an assistant coach to help out with these things, but then I remember they would probably screw up the system. "Alright, you know we have spring break this week. Coach gave us no practice but he expects us to maintain a daily workout. Don't slack off. We'll see you Monday," Seth says at the end. They all jump and holler and run off the field. "Drew, you want to hang at my place?" I notice he is nervous. It is a perk of being a best friend. "Which one of the guys is coming over?" I ask knowingly. He sighs and we stuff our things in our bags and begin the walk home. "Jacob Black I'm not scared of him, but…" Seth trails off. I get what he's saying; Seth finds it awkward. "I'll be there, but I call first shower," I say. Seth shrugs and kicks a rock. We walk most of the time back in silence, something we rarely see. "What's up?" "It's nothing just…" Seth says, averting my gaze. I nudge his shoulder and we walk around the back of Seth's house. "Fine, so I just don't get it. Everybody says the cult is so bad, but then why do all the elders not have a problem with it? They even like it! I just…I don't know." He isn't scared of the cult, but I never pegged him to be one of those guys that wants to be in it. My eyes bulge out of my head. "You like it don't you? Are you going to join them?" I ask in shock and slight horror. We both never hated it and at times when we were younger we both pretended to be in one of our own. As we grew older, we heard rumors that kind of scared me, but Seth didn't believe them. The only problem I have with it is that it seems to strip the guy of their past life and friends. "No! They…okay just a bit, but it's not what you
