Renoobsessed fangirl: Okay I do not own LOTR or any of its characters. J.R.R Tolkien does and he is a genius for creating them. BTW Has a bit of a twist on the movie but still pretty close to it. Summary: When Legolas was a child he met the youngest daughter of Elrond before she was sent away to learn how to use her powers by the Lady Galadriel. When the two are within a few miles of each other they can her each others thought. When he first arrives at Rivendell he can her a young elleth's voice within his mind, is it truly her after all of these years? Description of Alitina: She is an elf that is 5'8". She has long black hair that goes down to her lower back. While she in any cities she usually wears it down, but next to that her hair has one braid on each side of her face that is tied into one braid down her back. She prefers to wear her riding outfit but wears dresses when she is in a city for several days. She has blue eyes and somewhat pale skin. She is the youngest daughter of Elrond who left for Lothlorien to train to become a warrior and magic user. She has some healing skills but prefers not to use them because it takes a lot of her strength. She is 2,576 years old. Also Legolas is only about 20 years older than her. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Chapter One- Message from Home: Alitina sat on one of the trees near the center of the forest waiting for a certain elf to go by. A messenger from her father in Rivendell was to arrive today carrying new about the One Ring. She was hoping that Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn would allow her to be a representative of Lothlorien. She knew for a fact that her father wanted a representative from all of the elven kingdoms to be at this secret council that she has been hearing about. "Alitina," Haldir said from below her. She looked down at him and followed his finger. A rider was approaching. She stood up on her branch and began to walk gracefully on the branches back to the wonderful city that she has called her home for the last 300 years. She jumped onto a platform and began to walk quickly up to the throne room where the rider would have gone. She walked in as the messenger walked out. Galadriel stood there with a scroll of paper in her hands. "Hello granddaughter," Galadriel said, "you wish to return to Rivendell as a representative to Lothlorien do you not?" "Yes milady," Alitina said with a nod of her head, "I believe that my skills would be better put to use in whatever Ada is planning." "Then I give you my blessing," Galadriel said with a smile, "The Prince of Mirkwood is said to be going to it my dear." "I have not seen or heard from Legolas in the last 400 years," Alitina replied, "So for all I know he may not even recognize me." "I think he will," Galadriel said, "Now go and pack, you will return with the messenger tomorrow morning." "Thank you," Alitina said as she hugged her grandmother. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Next morning…. Alitina saddled her horse while waiting for the messenger to arrive so that they could leave. She wore a dark purple riding outfit /think of Arwen's from Fellowship of the Ring/. She had two swords strapped to her waist, four daggers hidden in her boots, and her quiver full of arrows and her long bow secured to her back. Celeborn and Galadriel walked up to her as she smiled at them. "We have come to give you this," Celeborn said holding out a lilac colored cloak, "Seeing as you always forget to bring one." "No i Melain na le," Galadriel said as the messenger came out of the stables while Alitina put on her new cloak. "I promise I will come back when this over," Alitina said as she rode off. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5 days later at Rivendell…. Legolas got off of his horse and looked at the beautiful elven city before him. Arwen and Aragon walked up to him. "Suilad," Arwen and Aragon greeted him. "Mae govvanen," Legolas replied, "Where is Alitina Arwen, usually she is here to greet guests with you." "She is in Lothlorien," Arwen said, "and has been there for the last 300 years." "A representative of Lothlorien should be here soon," Aragorn said, "They will probably have news of Alitina with them." "Go with Aragorn," Arwen said, "You two can talk about Alitina on the way to your rooms Legolas." "So have you seen her lately," Legolas asked as they walked away from Arwen. "Not since three months ago," Aragorn replied, "but she was doing well the last time that I saw her. She asks about you." "She does," Legolas asked almost shocked. "It seems that the Prince of Mirkwood may have captured the heart of the youngest daughter of Lord Elrond," Aragorn said with a smile. "I do care about her," Legolas said, "but I have been too busy defending my own lands from orcs to come here." "These are your rooms," Aragon said, "Arwen's are to the left of yours and mine are to the right." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alitina sat on her horse as it walked through the gate of Rivendell. "I'm finally home," Alitina said with a smile. "Ali," Arwen yelled as she ran up to her. Alitina jumped off of her horse and ran to her older sister. They hugged each other as they began to laugh. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aragorn and Legolas were standing on one of the walkways when they heard Arwen shout Ali. They looked over at the gates and saw the two elleths hugging each other while laughing. "Is that really Alitina," Legolas asked staring at the black haired elleth hugging Arwen. "Yeah it is," Aragorn said with a smile, "Hasn't changed much since I last saw her. Come on, you can see her after she has settled in and talked to her father." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alitina walked with Arwen towards her old rooms. Arwen smiled at her as they stopped in front of the doors. "My room is still the same one," Arwen said, "Aragorn's is located two doors down to the left of my door and Legolas' is the one right across from yours. Go and get cleaned up Ali." Alitina smiled as she went into her rooms and shut the door behind her. She walked over to her wardrobe as she took out her braid. She looked through all of her dresses before finding a green one /looks like Arwen's dress that she was wearing in Return of the King after she came back to Rivendell from heading to the Grey Havens/ and picked up a pair of lighter green slipper shoes. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alitina walked down the hallway to where her father's study was located. She knocked on the door. Her hair fell down to her lower back. "Enter," Elrond said from within the room. Alitina opened the door and smiled as her father looked up at her. "My dear Alitina," Elrond said as he got up and gave his youngest daughter a hug. "Hello Ada," Alitina replied as he pulled away from her, "I am here as a representative of Lothlorien for the council." "I am glad that Lady Galadriel had chosen you to come," Elrond said, "Your beauty shall shine on the council and your wisdom shall help us figure out what to do about the Ring." "With all due respect Ada," Alitina said as he sat down again, "The Ring must be destroyed if we are to survive these dark times. No where is a safe place to keep it. Sauron will search for t until he has razed middle-earth to the ground." "Why do we speak about happier things until the council begins," Elrond said, "there will be a festival tonight to honor the guests of Rivendell. I wish for you to attend this, unless of course you are too tired from the journey here." "I am fine," Alitina said with a smile, "I will attend it tonight." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alitina walked through one of the lavish gardens of Rivendell waiting for Arwen to come so that she can help Alitina with her hair for later that night. "Ali," a male voice said making Alitina turn around happily. "Aragorn," Alitina said happily not noticing the blond elf next to him, "Its been to long since I saw you last." "I believe that you know my friend," Aragorn said as they pulled away from each other. Alitina looked at Legolas for a bi not recognizing him. " Okay he looks very familiar," Alitina thought making Legolas laugh. "I should think that I looked familiar," Legolas said, "I would put bugs down your dress when we were little." "Legolas Greenleaf," Alitina said hitting him playfully on the arm, "I still have not forgiven you for that. You know how much I hate bugs." "It was still fun," Legolas said with a smile. " So I guess that we can still read each others thoughts," Alitina thought. " I guess that we still can," Legolas thought back. "Man le carel sí," Legolas asked. "Same reason as you," Alitina said, "I am a representative for Lothlorien. I'll be at the council tomorrow." "So are you going to the festival tonight," Aragorn asked. "Nae Aragorn," Alitina said with a smile, "you know how I enjoy a good festival." Alitina laughed with the two guys as they began to laugh. "Alitina," Arwen said as she came into the garden, "come now so we can get your hair done. We only have 5 hours to figure out what to do with it." Aragorn put a hand on Arwen's shoulder as she stood next to them. "I think that we should give them a bit of time to catch up with each other," Aragorn said, "Come, she will be along with enough time for you to do her hair in the most elaborate style that you can do." Aragorn and Arwen left the garden as Legolas began to look a bit nervous. "Are you okay Master Greenleaf," Alitina said smiling at him, "because if I didn't know any better, I would say that you are nervous to be around me." "Can we stop using titles Ali," he asked, "we've known each other since we were little children." "As you wish," Alitina said with a smile, "would you like to take a walk with me?" "I would be honored to," Legolas said as they began to walk through the gardens. "I know you have many questions to ask me," Alitina, "Why don't you start with the one that you want to know most." "Why did you leave Rivendell," Legolas asked. "I wanted to learn how to fight," Alitina said, "and father thought it was my time to learn to be a Lady just like Arwen did when she was my age." "Why did you not send word to me in the last 400 hundred years," Legolas asked, "I was alone without you." "You seemed to of not succumbed to grief," Alitina said, "so it looks like you were able to last without me." "Why won't you tell me the real reason," Legolas demanded. "Because all we seem to do is bicker," Alitina said stopping and looking at him, "and maybe I didn't want to bicker anymore." "We only bicker because you can't seem to let go of anything," Legolas said matching her glare. "I wouldn't have to hang onto things if you would have just grown up after your 1000th birthday like the rest of us," Alitina said angrily. "Oh and you think that you've grown up," Legolas asked, "You still act like you did when we were small children." "Go kiss an orc," Alitina said angrily as she walked away from him.
