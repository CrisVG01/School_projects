Nominated for the 2009 Middle-earth Fanfiction Awards. Summary: Can love bloom between close friends? Or will maturing prove to be the thorn that drives them apart? A story of friendship and love in the Greenwood. Many thanks to my betas over the years who have helped me edit the various drafts of this story. Wimsey, nautika, and many members of GoI gave me much input in the earlier drafts. For the final draft, I owe my undying gratitude to Aearwen and Ignoblebard. Without them, this story would not be what it is. Warning: While eroticism is not the focus of this story, it does contain graphic (though not explicit) sexual content between married couples and warrants a hard "R" rating. Author's Note: I will be posting a chapter per week so people have time to read, digest and review. If you have previously read Wild Roses in its original form, I'd highly recommend you try reading it again so you are not lost as I've added quite a bit to the original tale. Wild Roses By NiRi Chapter One Changing the Rules Greenwood The Great Year 310 Third Age Summer "Cellinn!" She stopped, her feet firmly planted, but she refused to turn her eyes towards the speaker calling her name. Cellinn crossed her arms over her chest and clenched her teeth in anger. How dare he try to talk to her after what he had done! "NO, Legolas! I do not want to forgive you! I do not ever wish to speak to you again!" Her anger had her trembling, and she hoped the harsh words would be sufficient to make him leave her alone. The sound of his steps halted and she heard his slight intake of breath, then he began in a placating tone that grated on her nerves. "But Cellinn, the stablemaster said it was a minor injury. It wasn't my fault — that fox came out of nowhere!" She spun around, her loose hair swishing out behind her as she turned and stared at him. He had folded his arms and his eyes sparkled with indignation. He had no reason to be indignant ! "Not your fault? You took my horse, without my permission, and ran her nearly to death, going break-neck over jumps—" "She's a better jumper than Echereb," he interrupted, as if that settled everything! She gaped at him a moment. "Gwaloth is the better jumper, so you thought you'd just take her , without asking , on some foolish stunt, nearly getting you both killed…" She let out a small scream of frustration. "I tire of your thoughtlessness! When we were children, you shoved those nasty creatures of yours in my face, and even now, you do not show me the respect due a friend! It never stops! Just last week, my favorite dress was ruined thanks to your showing off! I've had enough!" With each word, he had flinched back. Good! "I am done. As it is obvious I am not important enough for you to consider my feelings, I do not wish to be your friend anymore." Her voice broke on the last words, but she raised her chin so he would know she was serious. Even as angry as she was, pain flared in her chest saying the words, words she meant. She tamped it down with her ire. She had had enough. His gaze wavered, indicating he was shaken by her words. "You really mean it? You will end our friendship because a fox startled your horse?" Oh of all the arrogant, stubborn... There was no point in rehashing it again. He would never see the truth of what he had done, so she nodded once, firm, decided. "Yes! I told you last week that if you did something stupid once more, I would never speak to you again, and I meant it!" "But Cellinn! You always say that, ever since we were little you have threatened to stop speaking to me for such things, yet you always forgive me in the end. We have always been friends..." Legolas looked confused and tilted his head as he gazed at her, waiting for some explanation. Cellinn pressed her lips together in determination. She would not let him talk her into forgiving him this time. She had had enough of his pranks, his teasing, his irresponsibility and slimy creatures. "I may have said it before, but I really meant it last time. Now, leave me alone!" She turned back around and stared at the small pink flowers on the ground in front of her, fighting back the tears that threatened to well up in her eyes. "How was I to know you really meant it, when you have said it so many times before?" His voice sounded almost sorrowful, but she would not give in. He would never cease taunting her if she did not stand by what she said, no matter how much it hurt to do so. She kept her eyes on the ground before her. "It does not matter, Legolas. I am through with it all. I suggest you find someone else to torment, for it will no longer be me." And with that parting phrase, she walked away, heading towards the sound of giggling coming from further down the garden path. It was time she made a place for herself among the other young ladies. Her mother had urged her to do so since she was a child, but she had never listened, insisting on playing with the only boy her age. Now, she saw him for what he was. Males were dangerous, irrational creatures! They pushed the limits of friendship in order to show off their 'skills' for Elbereth knew what reason! Even stole her horse! S he was sick of it all! It was time she began to act more like the lady she was. She would reach her majority next spring; she was no longer a child, and it was time she started to act like an adult. It was unfortunate that a certain irritating prince had not come to the same conclusion when he had come of age almost two years ago. -o- Legolas stood in shock, watching her walk away from him. Cellinn was his best friend. She could not just up and decide to change the rules of their friendship all of a sudden! Could she? Sure, he had done some stupid things over the years, and she complained when she was the brunt of his pranks or they affected her adversely, but she always forgave him later. And she always joined in wholeheartedly in planning against others. And they always had a lot of fun. They had always been close, and he could not fathom his life without her in it. I shouldn't have taken her horse... She drew further away without glancing back, and with her every step, her rejection stung him more sharply. His fists tightened, his nails digging into his palms as he realized she was not going to turn back around and tell him it would be alright, that she would forgive him again. It was true; she was no longer going to be his friend - the only real friend he had. The only other elves his age were giggling, silly maidens, and he never understood them. His Cellinn alone was different. His Cellinn... He spun on his heel and fled from the garden and the churning, confusing emotions stirring inside him. He needed to get away, far away from the one who had cut him so deeply. He darted out of the garden gate and down the lane. -o- As she walked towards the other ladies, her heart ached, and Cellinn had to fight the urge to run back to Legolas as she had done so many times before. Unable to stop herself, she peeked over her shoulder, and gasped to find he had just disappeared. He never gave up that quickly. He must have believed her...or did not really care. Good, she told herself. But it did not stop the ache that pulsed in her chest. Doing the right thing or not, she had still lost her best friend today. Her feet slowed as she continued towards the sound of giggling females, and she frowned. Somehow, even with all pain and fear his dangerous stunts and irritating pranks caused her, she knew from the few occasions she had spent time with them that the other young ladies would not be as much fun as a certain mischievous, and terribly handsome, young prince. She slowed her steps even further, stopping to sit on a bench placed under an oak. She dropped her head into her hands, and despite her resolve, she let her memories take her back twenty or so years before... "Come on! No one is looking!" Legolas motioned for Cellinn to follow him. She glanced at their parents, seated some distance away on a much larger blanket than the one allotted to she and Legolas. The adults had seemed only too happy to agree to let the elflings have their own picnic a ways apart from them in the small meadow. The small basket, just for them, contained roast fowl, chunks of hard cheese, crusty bread, and almond cakes. There was even a flask of watered-down wine, though she suspected it was really just brambleberry juice. Her gaze drifted from the laughing adults, who were too caught up in their talking to notice the two elflings, and over to the horses. The picnic had been Queen Eirien's idea, but their mothers let them choose the location. Legolas and Cellinn agreed the glade where the mares and foals grazed would be the best possible place to spend the day. It was near the King's Halls, within walking distance, and their parents had agreed. The warmth of the spring day and the scent of new growth made them all a little giddy, and they had laughed and pointed out different aspects of the scenery along the way. When they arrived, the elflings had set up their picnic site as close to the horses as possible, which was not too close, since the mares herded their new babies away from them. Cellinn eyed the colorful wildflowers growing amid the grasses and longed to collect and braid them into crowns, but Legolas had his own plans for the meadow. Those plans involved convincing a young foal to come to him of its own free will. She even now doubted he could get any of the protective mares to come to him, let alone one of the skittish foals. But she knew he was determined. She had not heard the conversation that had filled him with this desire, but he told her of it often! If you could call a new foal from its mother, could get it to let you run your hands over its neck and back, if you could place a kiss between its eyes, then that foal would be yours and a special bond would form between you. Rolling her eyes, she stood up to follow him through the tall grasses towards the mares and foals. "Get down!" Legolas hissed at her, crouching low to the ground. Like a wild thing, he crept up on the very suspecting horses. Many of the mares raised their heads high, snorting and blowing as they looked with much suspicion at the small elf easing towards them. The small foals, most less than a week old, moved uneasily around or under their dams. Cellinn giggled. She loved it when the babies skittered under their mothersâ€™ bellies. A small, bay mare whinnied a command, and the group whirled, trotting away.. Legolas sat up looking rather annoyed and turned reproachful eyes on her. "You scared them!" he accused. She rolled her eyes. It seemed to her that if a foal was to choose you, it would be better to approach them outright, where it could see you, and not
