A/N: This was written for the August Teitho Challenge "Mountains" where it placed third. Huge thanks to Cairistiona for her work as beta. The morning was half gone already. The last of the dawn's mist had long since burned away, and Anor climbed steadily towards her zenith, heedless of the concerns of men. He had tarried too long. Aragorn settled his pack more firmly across his shoulders. It was a good hour for setting out. The longest day of the year had passed not so long ago; many hours of daylight lay ahead. He was provisioned well—as well as a lone traveler on foot could be. His clothes were light and airy; his boots so new the leather still creaked. His pack held an oilskin cloak and several layers of heavier clothes. In the last days of June, he was unlikely to meet foul weather even in the highest passes, but there was no harm in being prepared. Food he had in plenty, though it was so light he found himself pausing to open the pack and assure himself it was still there. Soil and sparse grasses crunched underfoot. With each step, there was less earth and more gravel. His guide had left him at the forest's edge, assured that given the maps he'd been provided with, he could easily find his way to the safest passes. Aragorn did not look back. If he let himself turn and see the forest receding behind him, with its carpet of gold and columns of silver arching up to a green roof, with its age-old claim on all that he held dear . . . If he let himself look, he would never be able to leave. He set his eyes forward. The Misty Mountains would grow no shorter. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ He had said his goodbyes by the earliest light of dawn, and the memory of them dogged him all throughout that first day. First, of course, he'd taken his leave of the Lord and Lady of the Golden Wood. He had thanked them for sheltering him in his hour of need, for their patience in allowing him to recoup his strength and their generosity in provisioning him for the journey ahead. They had called him "Elf-friend," though in his mind, he had done naught to earn such a title. Little that passed in her own realm escaped the notice of Lady Galadriel. She spoke no word to him aside from the formalized wishes for safe travels, but from the look in her eyes, he could see that she knew what had been said on Cerin Amroth on the longest day of the year. Celeborn knew as well—she would not have kept such a thing from him. They did not speak of it, but he could see sadness in their faces, mingled with a strange sort of pride. Why pride? It seemed a strange response to their granddaughter's choice. It was a puzzle to mull over as the grasslands gave way to craggy stone and hills turned to steeper slopes. Yet, there was little room left in him for thought of the Elves' strange behavior; his heart was too full from his last farewell. In a sheltered glade, while his guide waited a discreet distance away, he had taken his leave of his beloved—his betrothed. He turned that word over in his mind. Betrothed. He was betrothed. He was her betrothed. He remembered her hands—warm and smooth as satin, clasped in both of his, bearing a silver ring too large for the slender finger it encircled. He remembered a voice like the whisper of a summer breeze, murmuring that she would always be his and he hers, eliciting a single promise from him. He remembered lips, so soft as they brushed against his . . . He stepped in a gopher hole as he was dreaming about her soft lips. His ankle gave. He yelped, glad that there was no one there to hear, and hopped wildly on one leg for a few precarious moments. Minutes later, he sat on a nearby boulder, pulling off his boot and scowling as he probed his tender ankle. The bones seemed intact. Already, the sting was fading; perhaps he had not even sprained it. Either way, there was nothing to be done, and he could hardly fix it by sitting there and feeling sorry for himself. He stuffed his foot back in the boot and lurched to his feet in a rush of misdirected bravado. A moment later, he was sitting again and silently thanking all the Valar that no one was here to see this display. He rolled his ankle in a slow circle. No, it was definitely sprained, but it would carry him across the mountains all the same. He rose—more cautiously than the first time—and picked his way back to the trail, stepping gingerly. He had a promise to keep. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ He made his camp that night shelteredin a hollow on the knees of the mountain. There were enough scrubby trees that he found wood for a fire, and he'd shot a hare late in the afternoon, so he ate well and did not have to rely on Galadriel's gift of lembas. His map laid out a simple route thatshould see him safely across Celebdil, the Silvertine. Many of the springs that fed the river Celebrant had their source amid these peaks. It was supposed to be an easier crossing than Caradhras, though it lay further to the south and would thus add several days to his journey. As the night deepened, he laid out his bedroll with stone at his back and only the dying embers of a cook fire to guard his sleep. The air was still but for the soft buzzing of insects. Far off, a stately chorus of wolf song rolled and echoed off the rock faces. The sound did not trouble Aragorn overmuch; the pack was miles away, and at the height of summer, the lowlands were rich with game. They would not bother with such dangerous prey as a Man. He slept soundly and dreamt of an enchanting smile, of sparkling eyes, of dark hair flowing through his fingers like silk . . . He woke to a heart that was singing such as it hadn't since he was little more than a boy. Perhaps he was no longer young, but he was the son of kings with a great destiny yet to fulfill, and he had the love of the fairest and noblest maiden to grace the earth since Lúthien still walked it. He had but one promise to keep: he'd sworn that he would seek her father's blessing, if it could be had, before pursuing their union. She had told him—at a whisper, with only the moon and stars to bear witness—that she would cleave to him, even if Elrond remained steadfast in opposition. Yet, he could tell from the tremulous quality in her voice and the slight sheen over her eyes that he could not ask that of her. To sacrifice her relationship with her father would break her heart, and Aragorn would sooner cut out his own. He would simply have to convince Lord Elrond. Once, he had said that she was too high for the likes of Aragorn, but that was long ago when he was truly no more than a love-struck boy. Then, he had obeyed her father— his father. He had gone out into wild places and dwelt on her no more than he had to. He had not pursued her, but she, to his unending awe, had chosen him anyway. It was different, now that he had her love. Elrond would see that. Surely. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ A rain shower arrived around noon to dampen his spirits. But, only a little. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ On the third morning, he woke with a cramp in his back. He was surprised, then laughed ruefully at his surprise. Clearly, he had spent too many nights in soft featherbeds atop warmly-lit flets if a backache could come as a surprise after two nights of sleeping on stone. He splashed a bit of water on his face from the stream that ran by his campsite. It was startlingly cold—evidence of snowmelt higher in the mountains, but felt good all the same. As he rose, a bit of disturbed dirt caught his eye. He frowned as he went to investigate. It was as he feared; while he'd slept, some animal had crept into camp and dug up the remains of the quail he'd eaten the night before. The ground was hard enough that he could discern little of the tracks, besides the obvious scattered stones. It was troubling that he'd not woken. Perhaps the babbling of the stream had hidden the sounds. For the first time, he wondered if he'd erred in undertaking this journey alone. He shook off the feeling. There would be dangers in these passes whether he traveled alone or with two or with twenty. Aragorn had duties to attend to which had already been put off for too long. He could not have simply idled in Lórien and waited for Gandalf or any other of the world's few wanderers to happen by. The sooner he left, the sooner he could return to her. A few weeks of loneliness were a small price to pay; soon, he need never be alone again. He brushed tangled hair out of his face as he bent to collect his bedroll. Already, he bore little resemblance to the polished lord who had walked beneath the boughs of Caras Galadhon, and that was not entirely a bad thing. It was comforting, after all that had transpired in the past few weeks, to feel like a Ranger once more—to feel the wilderness sinking through his skin as the grime of days of travel dusted his clothes. But, then he paused to wonder what his beloved would say if she could see him now. If she could—dear Valar— smell him like this, would she still find his humanity such a prize? He tried to force the thought away. They had spoken long about his travels and his troubles. She had expressed only understanding and admiration for what he had endured. But, she had only seen him scrubbed clean and arrayed like an Elf-lord in peace time, at home amid the hidden refuges of her people. Would she still love him if she saw him as a Man among Men? He stepped out onto the trail and received a welcome distraction in the form of a twinge from his foot. It wasn't his ankle, of course—he could scarcely still tell that he'd turned it—but a sharper pain from near his heel. He sat and peeled off his shoe and sock. When he saw what was the matter, he glared at his fine new boot as if it had personally wounded him, which, of course, it had; he was forming an impressive blister. Grumbling to himself, he pulled off the other boot as well and swapped his socks for a thicker pair. If a mere two-day hike was enough to give him blisters, then clearly, he'd spent too much time walking barefoot over the green grasses of Lórien. That thought brought to mind many long hours spent strolling beside a sun-dappled brook with flowers between his toes and slender fingers entwined with his own. Aragorn pulled his boots back on and set out, a soft smile lighting his face. /-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/- /-/-/-/ The next morning, Aragorn woke slowly, as if dragging himself out of an enchantment. He groaned and pulled a blanket over his head. No, that was far too poetic a way to describe it. Rather, he woke as if he'd spent many ill-advised hours in a tavern, accumulated multiple head wounds, and spent the night passed out on the cobblestones outside. Blindly, with the blanket still covering his face, he felt about for his waterskin. When he finally gathered enough wits
