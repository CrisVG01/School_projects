A/N: Believe it or not, I do notown Lord of the Rings. I'm a squatter in Middle Earth. This is my first LotR fic, and constructive criticism is welcome. Special thanks to Calenlass Greenleaf who noticed that the formatting on the original version of this story was a bit confusing. Now fixed to remove a "mini-balrog." /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Arathorn paced furiously outside the door of his bedchamber. From within the darkened room, he could hear from time to time Gilraen's stifled cries and the muted coaxing of the midwives. Arathorn cursed his foolishness, his impatience. Gilraen was barely more than a child herself. He had no right to subject her to this . . . this ordeal. A scream rent his ears, as his wife's iron control finally broke. Arathorn snorted at the irony of the common wisdom that said Dunedain men, with their perilous profession, could better conceal pain than their wives and daughters. Arathorn cursed the acute senses that let him detect his wife's every groan. The child would surely rip Gilraen's tiny body in half. But, when he'd said as much to one of the midwives, the old matron had laughed and shooed him from the room. Now, he paced the short hallway of their humble cabin. The wooden planks under his feet creaked with every third step. The smoky scent of beeswax wafted from the class-encased lanterns, but their light did little to brighten the rough hewn walls. What kind of place was this for a birth? In generations past, his ancestors were birthed in cool stone chambers of grand palaces, surrounded by healers and friends, minstrels and historians. Now, his wife labored in the fading light with only her mother and two aunts to help her. She sweated and screamed, fighting with all her might to release another child into this life of wandering, another son or daughter to join the Rangers in the dark places where they walked unsung and unloved. There was a long, piercing shriek that slowly died into a high-pitched hissing groan. Arathorn's breath caught in his throat. The sound cut off suddenly. For long moments, the only noise was ragged panting. And then. The sound. It started barely louder than the chirp of a cricket; a soft, uncertain squawk. After a moment, there was another squawk. And another, each louder than the last until Arathorn's ears were assaulted by a raucous, piercing wail, two tiny lungs screaming defiance at the world that had tried to keep them stifled. It was the most beautiful racket Arathorn had ever heard. After what felt like an eternity, the door swung open, and his mother-in-law waved him in with that infuriatingly calm smile. "It's a boy." For a moment, Arathorn could only stand in awe of the scene before him. A white sheet clung to his wife's sweat soaked body but stopped at the waist, where the two aunts were working calmly amid gore to rival any battlefield. Gilraen's dark hair clung to her brow and neck. Her cheeks were stained with tear tracks, but her eyes were bright, and her face pulled into a dazzling smile. And in her arms . . . A tiny, red, wriggling ball of life fought to free itself from the swaddling wrap. Ten tiny fingers beat at the air. Ten perfect toes kicked ceaselessly. Black scratches of hair sat like a crown over a face twisted in consternation. Slowly, as if he were bowing at an altar, Arathorn eased his weight onto the bed and lifted a trembling hand to brush the feather-soft locks. At the unexpected touch, the baby stilled. The minute eyelashes fluttered upward, and two brilliant silver eyes appeared. Gilraen's smile broadened even further. She held the babe close as her husband leaned down to rest his forehead against hers. "Our Aragorn." ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// All was not well in the Tower of Guard. Ecthelion, son and heir of Turgon, paced the wide atrium of the Houses of Healing until he was sure his boots would wear holes in the flagstones. His two daughters sat quietly with their nurse, wide eyes fixed on their frantic father. The Steward's son could not spare a kind glance, even for his precious little ones. Yet another wail echoed down the corridor, and the girls hid their faces in their nurse's shoulder. Ecthelion drew a deep breath to steady himself. His wife was not as young as she used to be. Now, for the third time she pitted her will against the dangers of the birthing chamber. Please, the man offered a silent prayer to the Valar, please let this one be a boy, an heir. Every day, the halls and chambers of the Citadel seemed to mock him. Statues of ancient kings glared down on him. Preserve the splendor of Gondor? They seemed to whisper, You cannot even preserve your own bloodline. And ever, the specter of Earnil hung over him, for a ruler without an heir is nothing. His wife's scream again filled Ecthelion's ears. This would be her last child, of that he was certain. If by some grace his love survived this, he could ask no more of her, not even to preserve his line. Slowly, the man realized that the noise had ceased. A ringing emptiness filled the solemn corridors. He redoubled his pacing, resisting the almost overwhelming urge to barge into the healers' chamber and demand to know what was happening. Visions flickered through his mind, each more terrifying than the last. His wife lying pale, her life's blood leaking away, a child born blue and shriveled, destined never to walk, never to cry, never to breathe, his wife gasping her last breath even as the child expired within her . . . Ecthelion clenched his fists against the onslaught. Lirael had started to cry, her tiny face still burrowed in the nurse's gown. Forcing down his apprehensions, Ecthelion stepped over and ran a gentle hand through her tousled curls. At that moment, a courtier appeared and offered a formal bow. Ecthelion's hand tightened on his sword. His glare promised wrath if the man didn't swiftly deliver his message. "The child is born, my lord. You have a son." The man's fury was forgotten in an instant as he brushed past the messenger and strode down the corridor, forcing himself not to run because lords of Gondor never ran. The birthing chamber was abuzz. Healers and attendants scurried around a bed where his wife lay, pale and exhausted but very much alive. And there, squirming in the chief healer's arms was a tiny, squawking heir. Ten perfect fingers swatted at the strange, cold world. Gray eyes appeared and disappeared under an ebony tuft of hair. As the healer deposited the child in the father's arms, Ecthelion could only breathe in amazement. "I have a son." But the only word that reached Turgon was a brief message hurriedly whispered into the Steward's ear. "Your grandchild is born, my lord. It is a boy. Denethor." ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Raven curls flew every which way as they framed a face obscured by sweat, dust, and laughter. Elrohir jumped back from another wild swing and brought the flat of his own sword to block his opponent's wooden weapon. A grin split his normally grave features. "Not bad, little brother," he panted with mock exertion, "But are you ready to try the real thing?" The smile fell from his adopted brother's features, and the child suddenly looked as grim and solemn as it is possible for a ten-year-old to look. Elrohir stepped behind the boy and lifted the toy sword from his nerveless fingers. It its place, he set his own blade, long but light with a slim blade and a finely honed edge. Small hands curled instinctively around the hilt, and Elrohir guided them into the proper grip. Standing behind the child, the elf directed the little hands through the first few simple cuts. Then, slowly, he backed up, giving the new swordsman a wide berth. It made for a strange sight, the dusty boy in play clothes, his face grave as he cut and thrust with the gleaming blade. The boy moved in slow motion, his arms adjusting to the new weight. Each step was calculated. Each stroke was definitive. Elrohir frowned slightly. He had expected wide-eyed excitement matched with clumsy chops from this, his brother's first practice with a live weapon. This focused intensity was strange, and altogether disconcerting. The boy spun, and his eyes flashed past Elrohir. The gray orbs had taken on a strange light. They burned with strange, unspoken power. Then, the child's foot caught on a root and the spell was broken. He stumbled forward, nearly dropped the sword, and was again just a child playing at warrior. A bell tolled, and his grin returned. The boy offered the blade back to Elrohir, who grasped the hilt with slightly trembling fingers. "Run along to your lesson, brother," he said through his daze. The boy took off at a run, leaving Elrohir eyeing the familiar weapon as if he had never seen it before. The wooden sword lay forgotten in the shadow of the eaves. "He senses already the path his life will take." Elrohir jumped at Lord Elrond's voice. He hadn't heard his father's approach. "He sees and does not see the road before him, so he prepares without knowing why." Elrohir blinked at the child's retreating form and nodded slowly. "He's a wonder, our Estel." ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// White clouds drifted lazily across a clear blue sky. Gray eyes followed them longingly. "Are you even listening to me?" The tutor's voice was cross. The eyes blinked and darted back to the speaker. "Sorry, Master Pelendur." The child breathed. For child he was, despite the fine velvet tunic and intricately embroidered over robe he was arrayed in. The boy's dark hair was brushed carefully back from a face that was fastidiously clean. The only wear on his rich robes was from where he leaned against the little desk. The boy turned his face to the parchment with a sigh. There was a reason his lessons were held in this high marble hall. The only windows were narrow slits more than twelve feet above his head. Through them light could filter into the chamber and the boy could glimpse the sky, but he could not be distracted by anything more momentous than a stray wisp of cloud. He dipped his quill in the well-used inkpot and returned his attention to the Quenya vocabulary laid out in front of him. Dreams were for lesser children. They had no place in the life of a Lord of Gondor. As soon as he was convinced that his charge was working diligently, Pelendur rose from his stool and ghosted to the back of the chamber where a stern man watched the boy's progress. "How goes my son's tutelage?" "The Lord Denethor is progressing nicely, my lord." ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// It was the talk of the city: Thengel's strange swordthain had left the Rohirrim and was poised to swear fealty to Ecthelion, Steward of Gondor. All who could escape their jobs crowded the streets of Minas Tirith's various levels, all straining for a glimpse as the mounted company rode by. The whispers preceded them into the city. Even as the rider passed the Seventh Circle gate, maids in the Citadel were gossiping with pages over the arrival of this mysterious warrior from Rohan. Those lucky enough to be in the great hall did not have the luxury of gawking as the stranger approached their Steward. Messengers and courtiers affected disinterest while stealing quick glances. Few of these looks were spared for Ecthelion or the son who stood by his side. All eyes were on the bare-headed, dark haired man who advanced. Bright chain mail, the trademark of the Rohirrim, peeped out from under a travel-stained cloak. A long sword was belted at the newcomer's waist, and a fierce light was in his eyes. So entranced
