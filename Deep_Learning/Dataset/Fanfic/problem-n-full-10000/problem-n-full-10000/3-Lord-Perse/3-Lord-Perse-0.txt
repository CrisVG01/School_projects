The sky grew dark and thunder grumbled loudly, like a lion roaring ferociously. Strong winds blew unforgivingly against the son of Hades' skin but he remains not faltered. He went here to finally let go of all his inner turmoil and an impending storm will not stop him from accomplishing this last personal mission./p p style="border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #eeeeee; background-color: #333333;"He placed his right hand inside his pocket and fished out its contents – Mythomagic cards. He ran through each card, sparking memories of his younger years of naivety. At first, finding out that mythology was actually his reality seemed like a great turn of events for him. But now, it was the complete opposite. Living the demigod life was torture and he'd trade anything to have a normal life instead./p p style="border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #eeeeee; background-color: #333333;"A rumble from the sky broke him from his reverie.

It was Hades' statue, his stupid father's miniature model. This has cost his sister's life and he couldn't afford to keep it. And he couldn't fathom why Percy just won't stop giving it to him, so eventually he gave in and took it from the son of Poseidon, but not with any plans of preserving it. He'll get rid of it. And he did. He threw it into the cold and dark abyss of the waters./p p style="border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #eeeeee; background-color: #333333;"The rain started to fall harshly and Nico allowed the droplets to kiss his olive skin. Tears fell freely from his eyes, merging with the rain. His dreams of ever having a good life have failed, crushed and vanished. He has lost his family with the exception of Hazel, who he thinks is better off without him. She seemed happy with Frank and he wouldn't want to trouble her with his constant disappearances. So why not make the disappearance permanent now? Maybe she'll cry for some time, but at least she wouldn't have to put up with him any longer once she's moved on./p p style="border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 15.12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'GNU Unifont', Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; list-style: none; margin: 1.286em auto; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.5; color: #eeeeee; background-color: #333333;"But other than having no family, he considered what he thinks is his undoing – his preference for other guys.

He saw himself in the Lotus Casino. He saw his mother get struck by lightning just as he and his sister were ushered away by a mysterious man. He saw himself in military school where he first met Percy, his card game turned to reality. He saw himself crying as his sister chose to become a Huntress, which left a sharp stab of pain in his heart. He then saw himself in Camp Half Blood, face to face with Percy who gave him the news of his sister's death. A million other memories came flashing back: his horrible moments in Tartarus, his revelation in Croatia, his successful return of the Athena Parthenos to the Greek Camp. But most of all, his mind kept thinking of Percy Jackson. It was the image of Percy's piercing sea green eyes that was last imprinted on Nico's mind before his body got into contact with the cruel ocean.

Unless, of course, if Jason chooses to break his promise. This is the only way that he can think of to protect them from him, from the bestial entity residing within him.
