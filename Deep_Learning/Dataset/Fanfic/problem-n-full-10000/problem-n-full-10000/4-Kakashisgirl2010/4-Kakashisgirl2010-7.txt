Chapter 1: The New Girl In Town Dante's pov I been traveling for weeks now. I pulled into a small town called La Push. I parked my Suzuki in front of a store and went inside to get a few things. I took my time since I didn't know where my brother was. But I knew he would be here soon. "Who's bike do you think this is?" Came a voice from out side. "I don't know must be from out of town or just moved to Forks." Said another voice. I walked out of the store and saw three males looking at my bike. "Damn she is beautiful." Said the third. " You mean he." I said from behind them. They didn't turn around. "It's a she." Said the second to me. But there was a little bet of a growl in his voice. "I don't ride girls. I only ride guys." I said and that got them to look at me. Two of them their mouths fell open. The other one looked at me. "Only a girl would call it a guy." He said to me. "Will I rebuild him so yeah I would call it a guy." I said back to him. I was in my high heel shoes with the straps going up my legs to my knees. A black and blue mini skirt that barely went down my thighs. Then a midnight black corset. My long dark red hair blew in the wind. My silver eyes look at them I and can smell the wolf on them. "You rebuild this?" The second one said. "Yes I took a normal Suzuki and put in a sport engine in it. Leo can go up to 255 mph. He purrs like a cat but bites like a wolf." I said and their eyes got wide. "Really?" He said. "Yes really." I said as I looked up at the sky. Its going to rain soon. "Whats your name girl." The first one said. "You tell me ours and I tell you mine." I said to them. "I'm Quil, this is Jacob and Brady." Quil said. "Nice to meet you all. I'm Dante." I said and they started to laugh. I get this a lot. "I know it's a guys name. But it can go both ways you know." I said to them. But they kept on laughing and I growled at them. Then my scent changed then back to normal. That stopped them laughing and looking at me. "What?" I said playing dum. "Nothing." They said. "Ok?" I said to them. "So where are you going?" Jacob asked me. "I don't know. I'm looking for my brother. We slipped up a few years ago and lost track of each other." I said to them. "Who's your brother?" Quil said to me. "I don't think you guys would know him. He keeps to him self." I said to them. The looked at each other. "Ok so what brings you to our land?" Jacob said. I really don't like the way he was talking to me. "I don't have to tell you jack shit." I said in a cold voice. They started to growl at me I growled back. "If you move away from my baby and I get off your stupid land." I growled. They moved away from my bike. "Don't let us see you around here again." Jacob said to me. I smiled at me. "What are you going to do if I do? Kill me?" I said to them. Their eyes got big. "If see you again we might." He said to me. I giggled. "I like to see you and your pack try." I said as I jumped on my bike and took off. I headed to the town of Forks. Follower your nose to the animal drinkers. Said a voice on the wind. So when I crossed the line I smelt vampires and I followed it to a house deep in the forest. I pulled up to the house and turned off the bike. As I slowly walked to the door it opened and there was golden eyed vampires. All of them are males and the big one looked like fun to play with. "Why are you smiling for?" The bronze hair male said. "Cause the big one looks like fun." I said and the looked at each other. "Sorry I mean horsing around." I said to them. They looked at each other. "So what brings you here?" The blonde vampire asked me. "I'm looking for someone. A voice said to follow my nose to the animal drinkers. So here I am." I said and the honey blonde looked at me. "She is telling the truth." He said. "Who are you looking for?" The big on said. "His name is Blood." I said and the blonde's eyes got huge. "You know him!" I said fighting the erg to move forward. "Yes I do how do you?" The blonde said. "We are a team." I said to him. The bronze hair male looked at me. He was trying to read my mind so I pushed him out. "How can you do that?" He said to me. "I don't like people pocking around in my head it bloody hell pisses me off." I said. The blonde looked at me. "Your from Briton?" The blonde said. "Been there a few times for some years. Blood spent most of his time there so I picked up a few words from him. He said they were better then the ones I use." I said with a smile. "I'm sorry I haven't seen him in a very long time." The blonde said. Dante you need to stay with them till I get there. Bloods voice said in my head. Blood where the fuck have you been? I been looking for you these last hundred years. I thought back. "She got really happy just now." The honey blonde said with a smile on his face. Sorry I been working on something. You remember that battle we saw and we needed to help out? He said to me. Yes I remember. This is it then? I said to him. Yes stay with Carlisle no matter what I don't know when I be there. Blood said. Yes sir. When you get here can we play? I asked him. But he was gone and I growled. "Whats wrong?" Carlisle said. I looked at him. "Nothing you need to know right now. But would it be ok if I could come in and talk?" I asked them nicely. "Why should we?" The bronze boy said. "Cause Blood said I have to stay till he gets here. So I thought it would be nice to get to know each other." I said to them and their shock made me smile. "How do you know that if you been looking for him?" Carlisle said. "Carlisle Blood has gifts too you know." I said. "How do you know my name?" He asked me. "That's what Blood called you. So if I was wrong sorry." I said as I rubbed the back of my neck. Then my stomach started to growl. "Sorry I haven't eaten in a week." I said. Then a female came to the door. She had a heart shape face and she smelt nice. "Carlisle we can let her leave hungry." She said to him. She must be a mother. "Why you sad for?" The Honey blonde said. "She reminds me of my mother that is no longer on this earth." I said as I wiped a tear from my eyes. "Come on in." Carlisle said. I smiled at him. "Thank you Carlisle and I wont hurt anyone that's not who I am." I said as I followed them to the kitchen there was more females and a child. I looked at her and she me. Then she ran to her mother. . .while I think its her mother and put her hand on her face. "I don't know who she is." The female said. I could hear her weird heart beating and the scent of a vampire on her. "Hybrid." I said with a smile on my face. Never thought I would see one again. "You know what she is?" The bronze said to me. "I'm not aloud to say till Blood comes. I know she isn't a immortal child." I said and they looked at me. "How do ya know about immortal children? When yer not a vampire?" The honey blonde asked me. He has the eyes of a killer another fun toy to play with. "I know a lot about vampires but I keep that to my self." I said softly. Cause I spent a good time with the Volturi. Even if I'm a werewolf they used me for my powers and to help them. I felt sick to my stomach just thinking about it. If that bitch didn't do what she did then I would never have joined them. They kill most of my children. "Why are you growling and mad for?" The honey blonde said as he moved in front of the females. "Sorry thinking about my past." I said as I took deep breaths. Then the back door opened and Jacob came in. "Hey whats going on-" He started then stopped when he saw me. "Get out now before I kill you." He growled at me. So he imprinted on the hybrid. I wonder what he would do if I changed that. I thought as I let the bronze boy hear that. He didn't say anything but just looked at me. "No and your nothing going to stop me." I said as I leaned up against the wall. "Oh yes I am. Bella get her out of here." He said as he came at me. "Down now." I said and Jacob hit the floor hard and he didn't get back up. The vampires was just looking at me. Growls came from out side. "Sit were you are pups." I said to them and they sat down. "How can you do that?" Carlisle said. "Roll over Jacob." I said and he did giving me the death glare "I remember the day I made your kind. One of my favorite werewolfs. But its a shame that you dirty the name of them." I said as I walked over to him. "What are you talking about?" He said with hatred in his voice. "Really you hate me? I'm the well what Blood called me back in the day the queen of all werewolfs." I said to them. They looked shocked. "Werewolf don't live long." The bronze said and I laughed. "You vampires think you know everything don't you? The very first werewolf and vampire can make different kinds of vampires and werewolfs. Most of them you don't see cause of the magic or you chose not to see." I said as I yawned. "How do you know about that?" A pix girl said to my right. I looked at her and she is a seer not a powerful one but a ok one. I thought and the bronze boy looked at me before I shut him out again. "None of you ever wonder how it all started?" I asked them and they all shook their heads. Beasts now of days don't fucken care where they came from. I thought to my self.
