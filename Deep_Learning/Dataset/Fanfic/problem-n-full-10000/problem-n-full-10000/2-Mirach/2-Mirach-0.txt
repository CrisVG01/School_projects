Summary: In a rainy night, Aragorn walks through the Midgewater marshes. But not all paths lead to good ends, and dark things lurk at the crossroads… A story with sound and visual effects :) Rating: T Disclaimer: If you recognize it, it is not mine. If you don't recognize it, it's probably not mine, either. Not even the Neekerbreekers… My thanks to openmeadow for an inspiring chat about senses =) Dedicated to all my friends that walked with me through mud and rain, and that were lost with me until we found ourselves again. Crossroads of Light and Shadow S quelch. With effort he pulled his boot from the mud. It left a deep footprint. S quirsh. Murky water began to soak through the mud and fill it. Blub. The surface closed. Besides a few bubbles on the dark surface, there was no trace of his passing. Squish. Another step. A waft of something foul and rotten. With a sucking sound the mud clamped his foot. Squelch. Squirsh. Blub. Squish. Squelch. Another step. And another. Steadily he made his progress through the marsh. Bzzzzzzzzzz… He ignored the annoying sound, circling around his head. … zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz… The midges. There was no point in spending energy to chase them away – it didn't work. They were everywhere. He resisted the urge to scratch on ten places at once. Instead, he concentrated on another step. neek-breek, breek-neek! - another annoyingly loud insect… S quirsh. Blub. Squish. Squelch. Bzzzzzzzzzz … neek-breek ! Midgewater marshes. Aragorn cursed when he remembered Gandalf, waiting for him in the Prancing Pony, puffing smoke rings from his long pipe with his legs stretched to the cracking fire. Why did he only take this route instead of the Eastern road which doesn't sink under one's feet when he stops for just a moment…? There was only one answer, one short word, explaining all the strange and dangerous roads that he has taken in the last years. Gollum. That word was both a wish and a curse now. A curse – it began to rain… A light drizzle at first, like soft brushes from the cold fingers of long dead mornings. He pulled the hood of his cloak lower to keep the drops from his eyes. Then, a few heavier drops fell from the low grey clouds blending with the fog over the marshes. drip ,,,,,,,,, drip,,,,, ,drip,,,,,,,,,,,, DRIP ,,,, drip .. drip .. dripdrip drip .. drip .. DRIP ,,,.. drip DRIP DRIP .,,,,, drip drip DRIP DRIP DRIPDRIP DRIP DRIP DRIPDRIPDRIP The fingers clawed and punched him with cold wetness. Then, wind began to blow, the one that comes down from cold mountains and roars and rolls like a tide. It tore the hood from his head and plastered the wet hair to his face. The cloak couldn't resist the stream from the wallowing clouds anymore. Soon he was drenched through, the soaked clothes sticking coldly to his skin. Gollum! He bowed his head and leaned against the wind. Squelch. S quirsh. Blub. Squish. Splash. More and more water fell from the skies. The canes leaned in the gusts of the wind, and the murky surface rose steadily. Soon, the unclear paths through the treacherous ground were not visible at all. If he stops, then his feet will sink so deep that he won't be able to pull them out. If he steps on a wrong place… Gollum! And so he kept going, on and on, squinting against the rain and wind to guess some trace of the path, and flinching with every step in the expectation of sinking. Many times, only a quick step back saved him when he felt no bottom under the cold and greasy mud. His clothes were covered by it, and he smeared it over his face every time he rubbed his eyes to keep the water from them. Ah, why hadn't he only taken the nice Eastern Road… Squelch ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.

He pulled his other foot from its grip. It was released with a sucking sound, although it needed some effort to not leave his boot behind. Soon he stood with both feet on a path. Finally he could stop and rest for a while. But as soon as he stopped, the cold caught up with him. It grasped him in its chilling embrace. It seeped through his wet clothes, to his skin. First it was a dull touch, but then it drew its claws. It scratched. It pierced his skin and penetrated to his bones. Thoughts of the Prancing Pony came to his mind again. The cracking fire. The blazing passion of the dance of flames, unthawing the stiff limbs. The steaming mugs of boiled wine, spreading the fragrance of cinnamon and rose-apples and warming all the way from mouth to the stomach… But with those thoughts the cold bit even more. He shuddered and forced his fatigued limbs to move again. He studied the way ahead carefully before making a step. By losing the path he would lose the only chance to get out of the marshes and see the Prancing Pony ever again. He followed it through the twisting crisps of fog, fighting against the sharp gusts of wind. Forwards. Steadily. Determinedly. One step after another. Forwards. With every step the path became more certain. It rose above the surface and created a safe bench through the treacherous mud. Aragorn didn't remember this path. Even in good weather the paths in the marshes were unsteady, they changed and twisted. Some led to safety, some to danger. He hoped that this one belongs to the first, and won't end in a bottomless moor. The night was already falling, and gloom mixed with the fog like intwined snakes. It made the shapes unclear and grotesque as well as the colors more dull and blended with each other. There was some dark shape on the path ahead. The mist seemed to wind around it, a dark silhouette against a dark sky behind the grey curtain of rain. Aragorn squinted against the wind. For a moment, between two shrouds of mist, he could recognize the silhouette: a shape in the mist, oppressive and dark. A figure of a man carved of shadow. Darkness was his cloak against the coldness of the night and the raindrops glistened on his face like quicksilver. The figure stood still, unmoving. Until the thick mist veiled it again. Aragorn froze in the move. His heart quickened, and his hand moved subconsciously to the hilt of his sword. He stood unmoving, his body tense while his eyes tried to pierce the mist that veiled the dark figure. He listened. Thu mp - thump. Thump - thump. The beating of his heart was the only sound that he could hear through the roaring of the wind. The mist thinned and thicked again. But the figure didn't move… Clutching the hilt of his sword, he made a step forward. The figure stood still. Another step. Nothing. Breath in . …and then the veil of mist lifted. Breath out. He almost laughed aloud at his suspiciousness. It was a stone. Its shape reminded him on a figure of a man, yes. But it was a mere stone… As Aragorn neared it, he saw that the stone stands on a crossing of paths. One path behind, and three ahead, all shrouded in a veil of mist. Three ways, three directions. Three questions. Where? Aragorn suddenly felt very weary. He was cold and exhausted. Three choices, and he didn't know if even one of them led out of the marsh. He rubbed his eyes with his hand, and leaned on the stone for a moment. It was cold and rough under his fingers. For a moment he had the feeling that it moved! He shook his head. No, he felt no movement under his fingers, just the cold and wet roughness. It didn't move… It did! Cold and wet shadow… It reached for him. It embraced him. He could not pull his hand away. He could not move. Dizziness. Something seeping from him. Away. Light. Shadow. Confusion. ...w..h..i...c...h...p..a...t..h..?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dizziness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, s ,,,,,,h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,f ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, n ,,,,,,,,,a,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,g,,,,,,,,,,,,,CHOICES,,,,,,,,,,s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,G o llum! ,,,,,,,,,,,t,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t,,,,,,,,t,,,,,,,g,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, i ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,l,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ess ,,,,,,,,,,,, o,,,,,, h,,,u,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, s ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,h,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, hn,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. ,n ..r..r,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, i .s,,,,,,,,,,, SH a DOW ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ug,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,e,,,,,,,w,,,,, c ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, L i g h t ,,,.h,,,,,,,, h ,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ro ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,e,,,,,,,,,,,, e ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,l.

Short sharp light. Shadow. Wet shadow… Dark. Deeper then the sea. Cold. Incompleteness. Feeling of loss. Emptiness. Aragorn opened his eyes slowly. He lay on a hard and wet ground. His limbs were stiff, and the cold sank from the ground into his body like water seeps into a parchment. His head swam and pounded in the rhythm of his heart. He looked around. Mud, mud everywhere. Grey mud, grey sky, grey mist. The crossroads. He was lying right in their middle. The rain stopped already. It was deep night, and water dropped from the branches of dead trees, gnarled and black. The marsh was quiet. Too quiet… No midges, no Neekerbreekers. A dead silence… Suddenly Caw! Caw! Aragorn searched for the source of the piercing sound. Three gorcrows sat on a nearby tree. They seemed to slumber, their eyes covered with a pellicle, but – Caw! – they croaked from their sleep, and disturbed their own dreams. Aragorn shivered. Something ominous was in th… – Caw! Caw! – …at sound. He propped on his hands and knees. Taste of gall and ash was in his mouth. He,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nauseous . .,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,before ,,,,,fel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The,,,,,,,,,,,,danced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,his ,,,,,,,,,,,feverish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eyes. But there was something else. The feeling of loss, like a pain in a missing limb. He missed something, some part of him, and he didn't even know what it was. Slowly he stood up, and staggered for a moment until he found his balance. He looked at the four paths – four: he didn't know anymore which direction he came from. He didn't know where he was. No stars were visible through the clouds. Yet there were lights in the marshes. Cold, pale lights of rotting plants and bluish flickering of the will-o-wisps. Dead lights. Here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,and there ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,appearing and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,disappearing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,again ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,luring… The world seemed to have no colors. Grey. Everything grey. Shadows. Were this the Midgewater Marshes at all? He was lost. Truly lost. But he knew one thing: before finding the way, he has to find what he is missing first… He forced himself to think. What is it that he has to find? He didn't know. Why did he lie here, at the crossroads? He had no idea. What happened before? Vaguely he remembered deep mud and fierce rain. A path. Whirling mist. A dark silhouette ahead… a figure. No, a stone. Where is it? And Aragorn noticed it. The footprints… One coming – they were his. And one leaving… Maybe it was no stone after all… Finally he had an answer to one question. What he was missing, whatever it was, was where the footprints were going. He breathed deeply until he felt sure on his feet again. It was not the best idea – the marshes stank. Rotten leaves and humid corpses of trees. The foulness of mud-gases, coming to the surface in greasy bubbles… The nausea hit him again. He suppresses it laboriously, and stepped forwards, following the unclear footprints in the mud. He walked through a world of shadows. Thick cobwebs hung from the drooping willows and alders, and - Caw! Caw! Caw! – the gorcrows cried
