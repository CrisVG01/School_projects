Author's Note: Yes, it's true, I am finally, finally writing the sequel to Bound With Silver Threads that I promised all of you. I know it's been way too long, but I was working on finishing my in-progress fics so that I could focus on this as my final fanfic before transitioning fully to working on my original stories. That was until I started reading Supernatural fanfiction and my traitorous brain decided that it simply had to provide me with a compelling new Supernatural plot. But for that story I've gone back to my old method of longhand drafting, so that I can work on it when I don't have my computer and I can split times when I do have my computer between this story and an original I'm working on. Except for when I'm ready to type the SPN fic of course, but that's not the hard part. I'm going to try to stay a couple chapters ahead of this story, but the life of a performer is rather nebulous, so bear with me. Thank you so much to all of you who read and reviewed Bound With Silver Threads, and inspired me to write this sequel. If you haven't read it, do read it first! Seriously, you won't know who half the main characters of this story are if you don't. *Waits for newcomers to read BWST* Alright, now read on! -SQ Disclaimer: rettoP yrraH nwo ton od I Chapter One: In Sync Bump bump bump. Lorcan and Lysander Scamander dragged their trunks up the steps of the Hogwarts Express, deposited them in the first available compartment, and bounded back down the stairs again to give their parents a hug and kiss goodbye. At thirteen years old, the twins found nothing odd or embarrassing in this display of familial affection, and if they noticed the stares and sniggers of a few of their year mates, which was doubtful, they chose to ignore them. Lorcan and Lysander had returned to their chosen compartment and had just stowed their luggage properly on the racks when two more boys appeared in the doorway, dragging their own trunks behind them. "Morning," said the taller boy, whose short, black hair was slicked back with gel. "Give me a hand with my trunk, will you, Ly?" Lysander helped the newcomer lift his trunk onto the luggage rack, while Lorcan assisted his friend, who still looked half asleep. That task accomplished, the four boys sat down together, Lorcan and Lysander on one side of the table and Aaron and Bryan, which happened to be the names of the other two members of the company, on the other. "I see Cassie," announced the shorter newcomer, seeming to wake up slightly as he stuck his brown, slightly curly head out of the compartment window. "Where? Let me see!" "Ow," protested the curly-haired boy. The aforementioned gel sporting young man had accidentally elbowed his best friend in the rib in his eagerness to catch sight of the blonde on the platform. The two younger blondes already inside the compartment prudently decided that when the girl boarded the train in a few minutes would be soon enough to see her. Of course, it wasn't only Cassiopeia Malfoy that the twins' companions were on the lookout for. "Lily! Lily!" The blonde girl's companion, a redheaded young woman, past the attendance age for Hogwarts, though only just, looked around for the source of the commotion. "Aaron, if you lean any farther out of that window, you're going to fall out," she said, laughing and approaching the train. She let go of Cassie's hand to clasp Aaron's and Bryan's. "You guys only saw us two days ago," said Cassie, shaking her head. "Surely you can't miss us yet!" "Wanna bet?" said Bryan. "Aren't you excited to be going back to Hogwarts?" said Lily "Duh!" said Aaron expressively as the other boy nodded. "Are you sad not to be?" "Yes and no," said Lily. "I'll miss it, but I'm ready to move on." "Will you miss us?" "Occasionally," said Lily teasingly. "Are Lor and Ly with you?" Bryan's affirmative response was lost to the train's whistle "Aaron, let go of Lily so she can say goodbye to Cassie," said Bryan, elbowing his friend, perhaps in recompense for the blow he had received minutes prior. Aaron pouted over-dramatically but acquiesced, and Lily Potter pulled her girlfriend into a tight hug. "I'll miss you," she said, blinking back tears. It was silly, she knew, but she and Cassiopeia hadn't been separated for this long since they had met each other four years ago. "I'll miss you too," said the blonde with a smile, kissing Lily's cheek. "You'll write me?" "Only if you write me." Cassie raised a very Malfoy-esque eyebrow. "But of course." The whistle blew again. "Cassie," hollered the twins from inside the compartment. "You're going to miss the train!" Laughing her signature bell-like laugh, the youngest Malfoy disentangled herself from the youngest Potter and skipped up the steps of the scarlet steam engine, throwing a last wave over her shoulder as she went. "How was the rest of your summer, Cassie?" asked Lorcan and Lysander, who had not seen the oldest member of the group quite so recently, as the girl entered the compartment and situated her trunk and owl on the luggage rack. "It was good, thanks" said Cassie, smiling at the third years. "I spent most of it with Lily." "She has her own flat now, right?" said Lorcan and Lysander simultaneously, as was their wont, while Aaron made a suggestive gesture, which earned him another elbow in the ribs from Bryan. Cassie nodded. "Yes, she's a flat in Diagon Alley and starting up an apothecary business geared toward pet care." "Awesome." "How about you?" queried Cassie, tucking her feet up under her on the seat beside Bryan. "How was, Brazil, was it?" "Yep," said the twins. "It was great. Mum and Dad discovered a new breed of acrumantula." "Eugh," said Bryan, shuddering and making a face. "Remind me never to go to Brazil." Cassie, Aaron and the twins laughed, though not unkindly. "It's not funny," protested Bryan. "Have you ever seen an acromantula?" "Yes," said Lorcan and Lysander. "Have you?" "Nope," said Bryan. "Thank Merlin. And I don't want to!" "We have pictures." "What do you have pictures of, your cocks?" "Jenny!" The most recent arrival slid into the seat beside the Scamanders, ducking to avoid their twin slaps. She was a petite third year with a round face, long jet black hair streaked with purple, and an attitude which far surpassed her stature. "Can I see?" she said teasingly, waggling her thick eyebrows suggestively at the twins. "The pictures or the real things, I'm not picky." "No, you cannot," said the twins emphatically. Jenny Edgecombe sighed and shrugged in a 'what can you do' kind of way. "A girl can dream. So what are you boys up to besides sharing dick pics?" "We were not sharing dick pics," said Lorcan and Lysander. "Seriously, where do you even come up with this stuff? We were discussing our summer vacations." "Yawn," said Jenny. "Soooo predictable." "If you find us so boring, then why do you hang out with us?" said Aaron, raising an eyebrow. "Because you're less boring than the rest of the bozos at this school," said Jenny with another shrug. "Has the trolley come by yet? I'm famished." *****AMW***** Several hours (and several pasties) later, the scarlet steam engine chugged to a stop at Hogsmead Station, and her adolescent passengers jostled their way out of the doors and over to the "horseless" carriages in which they would complete their journey back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Lorcan, Lysander, and their friends watched contentedly through the carriage window as the castle grew larger, the light from the Great Hall winking welcomingly at them through the dusky twilight. The six students vacated the slightly cramped carriage, Jenny, Aaron, and Bryan jostling a bit while the others descended more sedately. Jenny took the opportunity to slap Lorcan on the ass as he passed her "Hey!" protested Lorcan. "Hey!" said Lysander. "Geez," said Aaron, shaking his head. "You really are one person, aren't you?" The twins were saved the trouble of replying by the group's entrance into the Great Hall. "Look," said Jenny, pointing. "The first years are already here. Bets on which one will wet their pants." "Don't be cruel, Jenny," admonished Cassie. "It's scary being up there being judged in front of the whole school. "Especially for a muggleborn," said Bryan. "Which reminds me, Aaron, we have an obligation to fulfill to Cassie and Lily." "That you do," Cassiopeia agreed "Right!" said Aaron, snapping his fingers. "But how do we choose just one? They're all so adorable!" "What's this conspiracy you two're going on about?" asked Jenny suspiciously, looking from Cassie to Bryan to Aaron with narrowed eyes. "When we were first years, Lily and Cassie kind of took us under their wings," said Bryan. "Like Hogwarts big sisters." "Yeah, I know that," said Jenny. "What's your point?" "My point is that you should respect your elders," said Aaron, earning himself an eye roll from the third year. "No, we promised them we'd do the same for another first year. Kind of continue the legacy." "Ugh," said Jenny, making a face and shaking her head. "Better you than me. First years are just soâ€¦eleven." With this brilliant comment, Jenny followed Lorcan and Lysander to the Ravenclaw table, leaving the three Gryffindors to their observation of the first years. Which wasn't as creepy as it sounded, really. *****AMW***** "Oof!" said Lorcan, flopping down on his four-poster later that evening. Lysander responded as though his brother had asked a question, which, as far as he was concerned, he had. "Nope, no new classes tomorrow." Somehow all of their new subjects had ended up on Tuesdays and Thursdays. "Seems a bit unbalanced if you ask me," said Lorcan, though Lysander hadn't mentioned the Tuesday/Thursday scheduling out loud. "You're a bit unbalanced," said Lysander. Lorcan gave him a look and the twins burst out laughing as, of course, the one twin was unbalanced on his own. They were still laughing when their year-mate, Nicholas Belby, entered the dormitory. Nicholas gave them a weird look and preceded to unpack his trunk. Unfazed by his attitude, Lorcan and Lysander sat up on their beds and greeted him in a friendly, if a little unsettling due to their renewed synchronization, manner. "Hi Nicholas, nice summer?" "Uh-huh," said Nicholas non-committally. "What'd you do? Anything cool?" "Not really. Normal summer stuff. You know it's weird when you talk like that, right? All at the same time and stuff." "We know." "Okay." The dormitory lapsed into silence again. The silence didn't last very long, however, as seven more boys soon filled the dormitory, entering in groups of two or three at a time. Lorcan and Lysander's year was a big one. Lorcan and Lysander were neither the most nor the least popular in it, and that suited them just fine. Most people thought they were a little odd, but quite nice once you got to know them, and they had enough older friends to back them up if they ever got into trouble. Not that they needed them; the twins had a more playful vein to their whimsy than their mother had, and a more proactive one. If you ran afoul of the Scamander twins you were liable to find your charms notebook mysteriously full of Shakespearen quotations or a box of wildflowers blooming in your windowsill. These pranks were so good natured that the recipients couldn't even really complain about them, and were left baffled both as to the reasoning behind such an act and the logistics of accomplishing it. This amused the twins (and their friends) immensely, and in their opinion more than made up for whatever the other student had done to merit their attention
