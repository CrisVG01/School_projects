Harry Potter Wants to be a Mediwizard! Summary: Harry decides that when he grows up, he wants to be a mediwizard. So he decides to start studying a lot more than Hogwarts Teachers teach them. Especially the ignorant DADA teachers of Hogwarts. Warning: There will be some bad language in this story as well as a wild power discovered by a bisexual Harry Potter. Harry is 11 years old in the story and I know that is about when most gay boys discover that they don't like girl. Disclaimer: I do not own neither Harry Potter in any way, shape, form or fashion as I didn't create it. Chapter One: Potter's Inner Circle Harry sighs as he looks around Diagon Alley. He has enjoyed being there for the day but he doesn't want to go back to the Orphanage five streets down. Sighing he decides to stay at the alley for the following month before Hogwarts. Sighing he picks his trunk up and heads toward the orphanage to offer pack his belongings to bring them to the alley to make sure the other children don't steal his stuff. Hurrying toward off he arrives minutes later. He stealthily goes to his room to pack his stuff before he sneaks back out and to the Leaky Cauldron to rent a room to stay in. after securing a good room he heads toward Madam Malkin's shop to buy a formal outfit. The door chimes pleasantly and Harry strides over to the fancier outfits as it might be wise to buy some of those as well. He instantly spots a neat thread shawl with a hood in summery colors. Seeing as he is always cold it might be good to at least get two of them. Suddenly he gets the feeling he is being watched before a girl with bushy hair and larger front teeth appears at his side. "Hi, I'm Hermione. Are you going to Hogwarts as well?" Harry turns toward her and raises his eyebrows. "I am, since I don't want to be mobbed please call me James. I'm probably going to be in either Ravenclaw or Slytherin. If you start being prejudice against Slytherins, even if I am not one, we can't be friends." He says as he offers his hand for a shake. Her eyes begin sparkling with delight for some reason. "Thanks, not meany people seem to want to befriend me, they keep calling me bossy and 'mudblood' whatever that means. Are you getting those shawls? I think they match your eyes. I can help you pick an outfit, not meaning to be rude. I like fashions and I really need to learn the fashions of the Wizarding world but I don't know much about them." Harry raises an eyebrow as she starts dragging him down the isles to look for clothes for both of them. After a few moments a pair of adults who look like her wonder over with consternation on their faces. "Let's go Hermione. " the woman says sternly before glaring at Harry. He notices the visible flinch that Hermione gives and watches her trail after her mother. Going to the cash register he tells the girl to watch those for a few moments. Going out the door he instantly spots her ridiculously tall father and trails after them. They wave at a woman, who must be a professor, before leaving a few paces and entering the first dark alley they can find. Trailing after them he hides in the shadows to listen in on them. "Well there you go, heathen! Now don't come running back to us, Witch!" Hermione gets a dead look in her eyes as she accepts the bags thrown at her. She appears to be numb at the loss of her parents, almost like it didn't phase her much. Stepping out of the shadow next to her he sees her jump before her eyes widen. Harry simply stares at her for several moments before she starts tearing up. Harry instantly walks over and hugs her as she sniffles a little bit. She begins ranting about how they hated her for learning to control her accidental magic at a young age. How they had tried everything to make the magic vanish thinking it was a demon. Her parents are Jehovah Witnesses and they instantly thought she was a devil worshiper when McGonagall first visited. After a few moments of silence she straightens her clothes out before Harry gently grabs her wrist and begins pulling her along silently. After arriving on the steps of Hogwarts Harry goes over to the hidden help desk. "Yes?" The goblin says alertly at the sight of the two of him. He seems weary at the sight of him and Harry sighs. "I met Hermione about an hour ago before following her and her parents. I suspected something was wrong and then I seen them leave her in the alley while calling her a heathen. I would like to formally induct her into the Noble House of Potter if that is possible." Hermione turns toward him slowly blinking with wide eyes. The goblin grins a toothy grin at the offer. "Very well, we also have four more abandon by their parents. They have no funding and we may not be able to support them. I would like to request you induct those as well." Harry grits his teeth with anger. The goblin frowns as he takes a deep, long breath. "Muggles are the stupidest people in the world." he snarls before nodding to the goblin. "I'll induct them but if anymore are treated as such by muggle relatives send me a message. Also, I'd like to set up trust vaults for each of them and apply for emancipation if possible." The goblin raises an eyebrow before nodding. He turns toward the goblin that appears at their side before they speak briefly. Both goblins bow to him surprising the people nearby. "Please follow me." The goblin says with a nasal voice. After a few minutes they are in an office with the other children. All but one seem to have accepted their fate. A smaller one is crying heavily though, snot and buggers are being wiped away by a larger child. All of them turn toward the down and their eyes turn dead for a moment before they go back to ignoring the two of them. "Mister Potter, please follow me while Hermione is Registered." The goblin says and Harry nods to Hermione as the children turn to him out of curiosity. After going down a few more doors they arrive in front of the 'Inheritance' room. The goblin knocks before opening the door for Harry to enter. After stepping into the room he notices that there are too many files to count. Going up to the desk he sits at the offered chair as the goblin stares at him. "I'll be needing your surname." The goblin says in a 'no-nonsense' tone of voice. "Harry James Potter is my full name if that helps. I have come to request emancipation." He says causing the goblin to pause. He rolls his chair a little from him before shuffling through one of the towers of cabinets. After grabbing a file he rolls over to the desk again. "Mister Potter, before we get started I will ask that you offer some blood and magic for the testing parchment to verify your identity and date of birth." Harry takes the offered dagger and parchment and effortlessly gashes deeply into his palm. The goblin's eyes widen before they turn to an interested look. Holding his hand against the sheet of parchment he waits patiently before it dings like a microwave would once finished. At that moment words appear all over the center of the page and spread out a little to be more easily read. Name: Harold 'Harry' James Fleamont Potter Date of Birth: July 31 st , 1980 Age: 11 years … Creature Inheritance… 5% Goblin (Inactive) 20%Veela 35% Human 40% Lycan Lord (Inactive) … The Following is ONLY Potential… … Magical Abilities… Magus Sight Ambient Magic Control Wandless Magic Soundless Magic Shadow Magic (Not Potential: Currently weak but used for hiding) Parseltongue (Not Potential: Has the ability and has been practicing frequently) END LIST Harry blinks as he realizes that he isn't entirely human. Handing the list to the goblin after skimming through it he watches him raise an eyebrow. "Now that you are confirmed to be who you are we can activate the Emancipation Files your mother left for us to use once you become of age to enter Hogwarts. She assumed that you would be living with abusive caretakers and while we are unable to confirm we can activate the parchment anyway. We will need you to use a blood quill to sign three places and initial the other five." The goblin pulls a four page document from the file and hands it to him. Harry takes the offered quill and follows the instructions before grinning when the parchment vanishes. "Next we will need to use a full inheritance test to find out who exactly you inherit from.
