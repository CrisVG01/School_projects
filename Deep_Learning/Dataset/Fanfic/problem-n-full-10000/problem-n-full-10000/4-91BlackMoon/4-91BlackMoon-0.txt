I'm doing something different, so be nice. Sorry if there are any grammar errors. I do not own Twilight, except Eve and Josh Miller ;d I'm just making a family tree so you understand a little bit better and don't get confused. Billy Black x Sarah Black (R.I.P.) Rebecca Black & Rachel Black Rachel Black x Josh Miller Eve Miller Rachel Black (R.I.P) x ? Jacob Black - I remember being happy, before mom and dad died, before he broke me. Before I changed in every way possible. I remember laughing, and loving. Now I'm not even sure if I still have to ability to feel anything at all. My name is Eve Miller and this is my story. - "Mom?" I yelled as I walked in the house. I walked to the kitchen and found food everywhere . The walls, the floor, on the kitchen table, on my mom self. Everywhere. I burst out in laughing. "W-what did you do?!" I laughed. She huffed and crossed her arms. "Stop laughing!" She pouted. "S-sorry." I stopped laughing, still giggling. "So, what did you do to make it look like a bomb exploded here?" I said. "Nothing! I just wanted to make cake and a nice meal for when you father comes home tonight. That didn't work very well, though." She said sheepishly. "Dad's coming home?!" I screeched, and started jumping up and down. My father works in the army, and has been in Iraq for the last three years. We heard the doorbell ring. "I'll get it. You clean up." I giggled. There was a big man, with army clothes. "Can I help you?" I said. "Yes, is this the Miller residence?" He asked. "Yes?" I said. "Is your mother home?" He said. I nodded and gestured to him to come in. He followed me into the kitchen and chuckled. "Mom?" I said. Her head shot up. "Eve!" She said, and blushed. She looked at the man. "Hello, I'm Rebecca Miller." (Jacob's sister, I know she is actually a lot younger but that doesn't fit in the story. She is 40. And Billy is just really old and Sarah died later than in NM, like 3 years ago.) "I'm Tim Stone. I worked with your husband. I have some bad news." I froze at the word worked . Dad was still in duty for at least 5 years. My mom froze too. Obviously catching the word worked too. "I'm sorry to say that your husband died in the line of duty." He said softly. And my mom broke down. I ran to her and hugged her. "He wanted to give you two this in case anything would happen to him." He left to envelops on the table and left. After we were done crying I picked up the envelops. One addressed to me and one to her. I gave her hers and ripped mine open. I read the letter, and tears ran down my face. In the letter stood he had 3 million dollars saved up for my future. When I looked up I saw my mom crying her eyes out. I stood up and hugged her. "It's going to be alright, mom. I promise." I whispered. She nodded. "It's going to be okay.." She kept chanting as she walked upstairs to her room. - When I woke up the next morning I immediately knew something was wrong, I felt it deep down in my gut. I looked at the clock. 11 AM? Mom never lets me sleep in that late. I scrambled up and scurried to down stairs. No mom. I looked outside and saw the car, that means she's home. I walked to her room and knocked. No response. "Mom?" I called. I tried to open the door and it was locked. After a while I started to get worried. "Mom?! I'm opening the door." I yelled. I barged in. What I saw would be burned into my mind forever. My mom had killed herself. "GOD DAMNID." I yelled, tears streaming down my face. I ran outside and called 911 on my cell phone." -next day- "Eve?" I heard Opa call. (Billy, Opa is Dutch for Grandfather.) My cousin Jake was pushing Opa towards me. "Oa!" I yelled and ran towards him. I hugged him tight. "I'm sorry, kiddo. I wanted to be here sooner but it's a long drive." "It's alright." I sighed. "So, what's going to happen?" I asked dully. "You're going to live with us. We're leaving tomorrow." He said. "Alright. I'm going to start packing." I said and walked upstairs. After I packed most of the stuff my bag was full and had to get another one. I walked down stairs and heard Opa talking to Jake. "How could she just kill herself?!" He said angrily. "Eve needs her! How could she be so selfish." He hissed. I saw red. How could he talk so cruel about mom?! Dad was her life! He doesn't know what he's talking about! I started jerking and shaking wildly. I ran outside into the woods. "Ugh." I groaned. It hurt! Why the fuck do I hurt so bad! I exploded. - I looked around and saw everything much more clearer. What happened? Ugh. I wanted to raise my hand to my head but it wouldn't work. I looked at my hand and.. They were paws! Huh? I must be dreaming. I walked to the nearest stream and looked at myself. I was a.. a wolf! No, I'm dreaming. I thought stubbornly. If I just.. If I just lie down and sleep I'll wake up in my bed. Human! I lied down under a tree and fell asleep. - When I woke up I looked first at my hands. Human. I sighed relieved. Until I looked around. I was still in the forest, under the three, naked. Shit. It couldn't be real. Can it? Double shit. How do I get back to the house?! I can't just walk back naked. Wait, it's dark, they're probably asleep. I ran back to the house and slipped outside upstairs. Ugh I feel dirty, I slept in the mud all night long. I thought about Opa's words and started shaking again. Calm thought, Mom, Dad. My last birthday when we went they got me my new car. After a while I stopped shaking and went to take a shower. I was back asleep at 5 o'clock. - "EVE!" I heard Jake yell. "What?" I snapped groggily. I opened my eyes and nearly had a heart-attack. Jake's ugly face was hovering above me. "JAKE! You scared the shit out off me. Get your ugly face out of my face!" I said. He grinned. "It was that or the air-horn." He said. "Go to hell and die." I said and glared at him. I pulled the blankets higher. "Now piss of, I'm naked over here." I said. He looked at me. "You're lying." He said. "Yea, but in 2 minutes I won't be. SO PISS OFF." I yelled. When I turned around I smelled him, he smelled familiar, woodsy. Werewolf. Flashed through my head. Shit, double shit. How the fuck am I going to hide this?! "Jeez.. A temper to match Paul's." He mumbled and left. I stood up and got dressed. (Outfit Profile) When I got downstairs Jake laughed. "What?" I snapped. "You do realize how cold it is in La Push right?" He asked. I shrugged. "I don't get cold." I said. And it was true. It was fairly cold outside when I walked in my birthday suit in the woods. But it didn't bother me. They nodded and dropped the subject. - The tree of us in the truck was a tight fit, but it worked. We arrived at a small house, it was cute. . We piled out and took my stuff inside. Jake and I took my stuff to a pretty big room. I could tell it was the biggest of the house, though. It had a queen-size bed, a closet build in the wall, an dresser, an own bathroom, a desk, a window seat and a book-case. I turned to Jake with a big smile. "Thank you, so much!" And hugged him quickly. I stared at him until he felt uncomfortable and he left. I sat on the bed and pulled a picture of me and my parents out of the suitcase. That's when the waterworks began. - I woke up with puffy red eyes and a red face. I walked to the huge mirror above my dresser. I looked hideous! I quickly unpacked my stuff and went to shower. I went to the closet to get some clothes. You could say I was spoiled. My parents were loaded. My grandmother was rich or something and they got all the money she owned. So that means it's mine now. I felt tears prickle behind my eyes. Shit, not now! I willed the tears to disappear. When I came downstairs I heard some talking. "You can't tell Paul. We don't know if he's going to phase." I heard someone say. "Why?! He's been my best friend for years. I know what's it like to be abandoned I can't do that to him!" The boy snapped. "Look, you'll just have to wait until he phases. Alright? It's not like I want to, but we have to." "Oh yea, if one of you assholes dare to imprint on my cousin I'm finishing you off." I heard Jake exclaim. Imprint? I decided to make myself known. Then I smelt it, werewolf's. My eyes snapped wide open. I know they smelled it too, but just didn't want to acknowledge it. "Hey." I said as I walked in. Everybody stared at me. When they all just said hello and turn away I heard Jake sigh in relieve. "I'm going to do some grocery shopping. There's nothing here." I said and I grabbed my bag and left. When I was in the shop I bumped into someone. "Shit, look where you-" I looked at the man. My whole world stopped, gravity moved and everything disappeared. I felt to need to hug him, kiss him, protect him, I wanted to see him smile. I felt warm inside, happy, complete. I snapped out of my daze. "Sorry." He said sheepishly. "No worry. My name is Eve Miller." I said. "Paul Locks." He said and smiled a cocky smile. "I haven't seen you before." He said. "No, I just moved here. With the Blacks." I said. He stiffened. "What? You know them?" I said. "Yea, kind of." He said, scratching the back of his head. I waited for him to continue. "Jake, Quil, Embry and I were best friends until they all ditched me for Sam." He said. I felt myself shake with anger. How could they just do that! Hurting him like that! I growled slightly. He looked shocked at me and chuckled. "No need to get all worked up over it. It happened. I'll manage." He said. I nodded. "But, uhm. I gotta go. I'll see you around?" He asked. "Uhm. Yea.." I said. Not really wanting to go. "We could hang out tomorrow or something? As a.. date?" He said. I nodded with a big fat smile. "I'll pick you up around noon. 'Kay?" He said. We said goodbye and I went home, giddy. Happy for the first time sinceâ€¦ they died. I parked the car and yelled for Jake. "OI! Jake, get your fat ass out of here and help with the grocery's." I heard him grumbling inside. "I don't have a fat ass." The boys were laughing their asses off. "You so have a fat ass." I yelled back. Everybody's head snapped up. Shit, I wasn't supposed to hear that. "Did you just heard what I said, softly , all the way over there ?" He asked incredulously. "N-no. I just was expecting the answer." I said, saving myself. They nodded, not buying it
