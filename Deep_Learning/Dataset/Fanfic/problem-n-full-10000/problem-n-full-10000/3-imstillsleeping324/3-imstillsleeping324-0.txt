Hey guys. I'm back! Uh. . . So this is a rewrite of my story Posiedon's Daughter obviously. I just wasn't satisfied with how the fort version turned out. Anyways enjoy i don't own Percy Jackson. Chapter One: The Strangest Day Ever Hello, my name is Alex Jacobs. I'm thirteen. Until this year I've been going to Yancy Academy for middle school. And sometimes I feel like I'm going to wake up and assume my life was just a bad dream. No such luck so far. I have ADHD and dyslexia. This adds to the pressure of the hell hole that is middle school. Maybe I should start the story. My best friend Cornelius and I were chatting on the way to English. Our English teacher Mr. Miller was waiting for us the door. He'd always hated me. I passed him going in and he glared at me. "I'll never understand that man." I whispered to Cornelius. "He's always hated me. Is he even human?" Cornelius chuckled softly. "I don't know. You tell me." he said. We sat in our desks as our teacher passed out the last exam this year. I stared at the paper blankly as Mr Miller put it on my desk. The words started swimming around my head and making me dizzy. Lemme just tell you it took forever to finish the test. The next day Cornelius and I were eating lunch. A few kids passed us gossiping about random things. We heard a few giggles and turned to see Taylor Sage and Chloe Martinez laughing there butts off. I rolled my eyes. "What do you think those girls talking about?" Cornelius asked. "Don't know don't care." I said turning back to my food. "Why?" "I don't know." he said. "They're always giggling about some guy at school. There're are other things to talk about." I laughed. "Tell me about it." I said. I felt eyes on me. I turned and saw Mr. Miller staring at me, burning holed into the back of my head. His eyes narrowed as I stared back at him. Soon we started a staring match and I gave him a death glare. Then there was a tap on my shoulder. I jumped in surprise and turned to see Cornelius looking at me worriedly. "You okay Alex?" he asked. I looked back to see the English teacher had disappeared. "Uh. . . Yeah." I said. "I'm fine." Cornelius smiled and gestured toward the lunch door. We got up and walking throgh the halls in silence. A few minutes later Cornelius asked me something. "You've heard of Percy Jackson right?" "Yeah." I said. "Wasn't he like the WORST student the school ever had?" Cornelius rolled his eyes. "Yes. The kid who was kidnapped by that biker dude a few years ago." he said. "I don't think seven year is a few." I said. "Why do you ask?" "There was a rumor that he started hallucinating a teacher named Mrs. Dodds towards the end of the year." he said. "Thing is. . . He didn't hallucinate that teacher." "What do you mean?" I asked. "Mrs. Dodds was a the pre-algebra teacher. The real one. Then after a class field trip the woman vanished and was replaced with a perky blonde woman named Mrs. Kerr. Everyone believed she'd been the teacher all year." "That's. . . A little creepy." I said. "I actually went to summer camp the Percy before fifth grade." Cornelius said. "I was friends with his best friend Grover Underwood. I've only ever talked to Percy maybe 3 times." "Really?" I asked. My friend nodded. "The guy's actually really nice." he said. "I'm sure he is." I said. "I heard his father disappeared before he was born." "Lost at sea was what his mother said." Cornelius said. "But I know better." I rose an eyebrow. "What do you mean?" I asked. "His father was forced to leave Percy and his mother." Cornelius said. "What?!" I asked. "Yeah. By his uncle." my friend said. "Poor Percy." I said. "Yeah. Percy met his father after sixth grade." he said. We rounded a corner and stopped at the Latin classroom. We heard outside was our Latin teacher Ms. Alvarez. "Hello, Alex. Cornelius." She said nodding. We smiled and went on our way. We stopped at my dorm. "Were packing tomorrow remember that." Cornelius said. I smiled and nodded. "Okie dokie." I said before entering. Inside my roommate Alice was already packing. We greeted each other and went to sleep. That night I had worst nightmare. I was standing on top of a hill. Next to me was a giant pine tree and a giant statue of a women holding a spear in one hand and a winged woman in the other. I looked in front of me to see a giant monster with sharp teeth, spitting acid everywhere. "ALEX! Run!" I heard someone yell. I face the directions of the voice to see my mother running towards me. "Mom?!" I asked. Then Cornelius appeared beside me. "Alex, listen to your mom." he said pulling me towards the valley behind me. "You'll be safe here." "But-" I was cut off by my best friend. "No buts. Your mom knew this was going to happen." he said. "She's going to be fine. I promise." The monster spit at the two of us not even noticing my mother. I looked back at her and she nodded. "okay." I said and I let Cornelius pull me away. Then a scream pierced the air. I looked back in horror to see my mother had been caught in the claw of the thing. "NO!" I woke up in cold sweat. It was morning and someone was knocking on the door. Alice got up groggily and opened the door to see Cornelius. "Oh hey." she said. "Alex just woke up. Uh. . . Come in." Cornelius thanked her and headed towards me. "Alex, get out of bed." he said. "We gotta start packing." "Let's have some breakfast first." I said. "Okay, fine." Cornelius said. "But we leave right after were done packing." I looked at Alice we shrugged. Cornelius and I headed down for breakfast and my best friend devoured his food in a rush. As soon as we got packed he pulled me to the bus stop. "Uh. . . Cor." I said reached the stop. He turned to me. "Uh. . . Are you okay? You've been really jumpy this morning." "Oh yeah I'm fine." he said stiffly. I could tell he was lying. "Uh huh. And I'm British." I said an eyebrow raised. "Okay I'm not fine." he said. "It's just. . . I'm worried about you." I looked at him. "Why?" I asked confused. "Because. . . I'm just worried something will happen to you over the summer." he said. I chuckled. "Cor. You practically live with me." I said. "If something were to happen to me, you'd be there for me." Cornelius nodded, but obviously not reassured. "No, but seriously. I know you'll be there for me." I said, putting a hand on his shoulder. He smiled weakly at me as the buss pulled in to the stop. We climbed in. When I sat down I noticed a certain man sitting in front of me. Mr. Miller. "What's HE doing here?!" Cornelius asked. "I dunno." I said. "Maybe his house is on the way?" Cornelius bit his lip and sunk into his seat. My English teacher turned around and glared at me. For a minute, I thought he was going to attack me. He growled and turned back around. Like literally growled like an animal. My eyes widened and I sunk into my seat as well. "You heard that too. . . Right?" I said turning to my best friend. He nodded fearfully. Suddenly the bus stopped. I realized that it was our stop. I hurriedly grabbed my things as did Cor. We both rushed off the bus. I looked over my shoulder to see my English teacher still glaring at me through the window of the bus. We reached my house. I stared at it smiling. sure it was big and it looked empty but with basically three people living in it, there was always someone to spend time with. Perhaps I should mention that my mother's business woman. She started the company when she turned 34. It's been up and running for 20 years. While my mother's usually pretty busy she still finds a way to make time for me when I'm home. I knocked on the door and it was opened my mother herself. "Hi, mom." I said hugging her tightly. She hugged me back. "Hi sweetie." she said as we pulled away. "How your term? You too Cornelius." "Good." I said. "My grades weren't that bad. A few Bs and Cs but over all mostly As." "Same." Cor said. She smiled proudly and lead us in. "Home sweet home." I said, later on collapsing on my bed. My friend chuckled. It was about 10:00 pm. We'd just finished having dinner. Cor chuckled sitting on the chair at the desk. His room was next to mine. Obviously my mother would never let us sleep in the same room. Then he became solemn. "Hey, what's wrong? You've been pretty skittish lately." "Huh?" he said, apparently distracted. "Oh yeah I'm fine." I rose an eyebrow. "Uh huh." I said. "And I'm a wizard." Cornelius chuckled. "Okay. Truth is I'm worried about you." he said. "I have a bad feeling about this summer." I smiled and put a hand on his shoulder. "We'll always be there for each other." I said hugging him. "Now get out of my room." I said shoving him out. Cornelius let out a laugh and went into his room. I smiled fondly as I went to my closet and grabbed my pajamas. I changed and went to sleep not prepared for the night,are the would plague my dreams that night. I stood on a hill next a pine tree and a statue. I looked at the valley and everything in it was practically dead. I saw cabins in the distance near a patch of strawberry bushes. Then to put it plainly it caught on fire. My eyes widened. I heard screams and I saw teenagers running out of the them. I saw a kid with outstretched arms water washed over the cabins, obviously an attempt to put out the fire. Beside me was man "Pathetic." he said smirking. "You'll do well to join me instead, girl." I backed away from him. "Never." I said. "Very well then." he said. He flung his hand at me. A ring fire surrounded me. I screamed. The fire closed around me. "HELP!" I yelled. I woke up in a cold sweat. My mother was sitting by my side. "Are you okay, sweetie?" she asked, concerned. I shook my head not wanting to lie. She smiled tenderly and pulled my close to her. "A nightmare?" I nodded into her chest. "Yeah." I said. We sat there in a comfortable silence. Then my mother withdrew from me. "I'm going to need to pack a bag, sweetheart." she said. I looked up at her. "Why?" I asked. "No questions." she said. "I just need you to pack. Cor's already packing." I rose an eyebrow but didn't question her. Half way through packing I heard a boom out side. My eyes widened. Cornelius rushed into my room and shut my bag, put it over my shoulder, and pulled me out of my house though the back door. "Where's my mom?" I asked. Cornelius shushed me made me duck behind a bush. Standing my house was Mr. Miller. "She's hiding in the basement." Cornelius whispered. "Why? It's just our English teacher." I whisper yelled. "No it's not." he said. Suddenly Mr. Miller turned on us and the strangest thing happened. His face started melting off and he started morphing into something
