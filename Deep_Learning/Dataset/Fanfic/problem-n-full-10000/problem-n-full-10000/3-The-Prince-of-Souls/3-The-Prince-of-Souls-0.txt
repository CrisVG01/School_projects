And here is my newest creation, The Blood of the Moon! I was sitting down one day, in school, and this idea popped into my head. I have high hopes for this story, however. Also, this will be PerZoë , so sorry to all Pertemis fans from my other two PJO stories. Well, I plan for it to be PerZoë… * WARNING: A MILD RAPE SCENE IS AHEAD! * Yeah, it is like, a small one… Not a lemon, however. I'll never write those. I will give you a little heads-up, for those who hate that kind of crime. Anyway, let's crack on with the first chapter! I hope you enjoy! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Blood of the Moon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ An arrow landed in the centre of a make-shift target. The full moon hung high in the star filled sky, giving the dense forest a faint, silvery glow. Another arrow soured through the air, splitting it in half. "I think that I won that one, Artemis." A man grinned, turning to the girl next to him. He had a tall, muscular frame. His skin was the colour of wheat toast. His hair seemed to be undercut, which was swept into spikes on top. He looked handsome. He wore a black exomis , which was a short chiton fastened on the left shoulder. A hunting knife was strapped to his side. He held a black bow in his left hand, his right hand reached over to his shoulder to his back, where he pulled out another arrow. His eyes, however, ruined the image. At first glance, they would have been easily mistakes for a pair of high-tech, futuristic goggles. But, they were in fact bronze mechanical eyes embedded into his sockets. Focusing rings spun and clicked as he turned to his companion. She, on the other hand, was drop dead gorgeous. She wore a simple knee-length chiton , tied with a cord at her waist. Her silky auburn hair was cut so it was roughly shoulder length. Her eyes were another story; they were strikingly beautiful silver. "No, I win, Orion!" Artemis complained, a similar smile gracing her lips. "Draw then?" Orion said, his smile faulting slightly. "Fine!" Artemis' smile dropped slightly as well, hoping that her companion would just give in and admit that she won, even though it was a tie. The pair of them was on a small hunting trip. Artemis, the goddess of hunting, the moon, childbirth and wild animals, had left her hunters at their own camp far away from her, while she went on a small expedition with her best friend. Her first male friend. Orion, on the other hand, only had a few ideas running through his mind. It was how to get the goddess wrapped even more around his little finger. She was head over heels for him. And it was all because of his hunting skills. But he didn't care. He wasn't interested in her. His main interest was her being friends with him, but they continuously changed. Artemis grabbed another arrow from her quiver, and raised her bow, taking aim at the target. She released her two fingers, and the silver arrow tore through Orion's arrow. The giant son of Poseidon smiled again. "Alright then. How about a small bet?" Orion's smile grew, showing his yellowing teeth off to the goddess. Artemis' silver eyes twinkled with light at that comment. "I'm listening." "The loser owed the winner something, as long as it is within reason." Orion suggested, and Artemis nodded. "Sure. Ten arrows. A hundred metres." Artemis agreed, and they both raised their bows, an arrow lodged in the string. Two targets appeared in the distance. Arrows flew through the air, bull's-eye after bull's-eye. Both ran up to their targets to see who had won. Orion cursed under his breath. He had just missed one bull's-eye, off by a mere inch. Artemis had split most of hers, and as expected - all were in the bull's-eye. Artemis grinned, and fist pumped into the air. "Yes!" She cheered, dancing around the small clearing. "I win, you lose!" Orion scowled. He hated losing. And no goddess was going to be a better hunter without being punished. Especially jeer at him. * WARNING * Before Artemis could blink, Orion had punched her in the sternum, and she fell down, struggling to breathe. Pulling out his hunting knife, Orion cut off the girl's chiton , exposing her naked body to the bitter night. "What are you -?" Artemis was silenced by some of her clothes being bound around her mouth, like a gag. Her wrists and ankles were tied together, and an unspeakable crime happened. The moon began to lose its shine; tears were brimming around the moon goddess' vibrant silver eyes. Orion stood up and dusted himself off. "Nobody goes unpunished, Artemis. Not even you." Orion sneered, and redressed himself. Artemis just continued to lay there, shame swallowing her up. * WARNING OVER * She felt violated. Everything she had ever stood for had been destroyed by that one male. Her maidenhood had been ripped out of her. Her form began to flicker slightly, the goddess feeling the majority of her power leave her. The moon slowly faded, the silver light in her eyes slowly diminishing. The giant picked up his weaponry before running away, all emotion leaving his mind. A golden flash appears in the distance. "Artemis!" A distant voice called out. Apollo, Artemis thought. Gods, she had never been so relieved to hear her brother's voice. She opened her mouth to call him, but no sound came out. "Holy mother of Zeus!" Her brother exclaimed, and light footsteps ran over to her. The goddess' vision began to blur around the edges. Apollo was crouched over her, pale. His sandy blonde hair was sticking up all over the place, like he had just woken up. His eyes were filled with worry. He looked around, and whipped out his hunting knife, cutting his older sister's bindings off of her. "Hold on sis," Apollo assured her, pulling Artemis into a small hug. They vanished in a flash of gold, reappearing before a small cottage. Apollo knocked on the door. A grown man opened up the door. He had long, blonde hair and icy blue eyes, like Apollo. "Father," The man said curtly, "Why is Aunt Artemis in your arms?" "She was raped, Asclepius." Was Apollo's simple answer, and his son ushered them into the cottage. "Put her down there." The demigod pointed to a hammock in the corner of the place. Asclepius grabbed a bunch of herbs from his cupboards, looking around for any remedies already made. He saw Artemis' form flicker slightly as she laid there, her eyes half closed. "Father," The demigod complained, "You forgot to mention that she was fading!" "Wait..." Apollo held up his hands, whirling around on his son. " WHAT?! " "She has no tie left. A lot of her power was taken from her because of her maidenhood being stolen by some man." Asclepius explained. "I know when someone is fading, son, but I just didn't... You know... Expect her to fade when she has like... Uh... Eighty hunters? Yeah, eighty." Apollo looked thoughtful, before turning to his sister. He grasped her hand and rubbed circles in on the back of her palm. "When will we know though?" The sun god asked. "Soon. A few days at least." His son replied, using a mallet to crush some herbs up. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Blood of the Moon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ "Well, sleeping beauty finally awakes." Artemis opened up her eyes. She looked around, seeing a bright light blinding her vision. Two men with curly blonde hair looked over her. Apollo and Asclepius. "You okay, sis?" Apollo asked, and Artemis nodded weakly. "Water," She croaked, her throat parched. The healer ran away to get a small cup of water. His father helped the weak goddess sit up as he placed the beaker to the goddess' chapped, pink lips. "Thank you..." She muttered, and Apollo held back a tear. She was still fading. "Artemis..." Apollo spoke as calm as a brother could in that situation. "Who did this to you?" Artemis felt torn. The only man she had ever trusted had just committed a heinous crime against her. He deserved a fate worse than death. "Orion..." Her words were not followed by silence. Asclepius ran into the kitchen as his father was on the verge of exploding. " WHAT?! " Apollo roared, and prepared himself to enter his godly form. "Just... Let him go... I'll deal with him." Artemis whispered, grabbing her brother's arm. "You better kill him, Arty," Apollo warned. "Or I will. And it won't be pretty." Artemis' arm dropped, and she felt a bit queasy. There was a strange presence in her abdomen. She didn't recognise it at all. It felt familiar to her though. "How long was I out?" She asked her brother, dreading the answer. "About three days. How come...?" Apollo arched an eyebrow, lowering himself to her level. Artemis' eyes widened. It was impossible. She closed her eyes, and looked deep within her. She could see a small zygote. It was microscopic, but she could still see it. Artemis gasped her eyes wide open. "What is it?" Apollo asked. "I'm... Pregnant..." Artemis said weakly, sweat running down her brow. She couldn't possible keep it. It might turn out to be like Orion - male or female. Apollo's ocean blue eyes widened at that hearing that. His breath hitched. He didn't know wherever to be somewhat happy for his sister or use it as yet another excuse to kill the son of Poseidon in the most painful method imaginable. "Artemis... Will you keep it?" The sun god asked. Artemis had a small smile. No, she would raise her child. If it was male, she would raise him to never break a girl's heart, and to be loyal unlike her pig of a father, cousins and brothers. If it was female, she would raise her to protect every young child, like her, and follow in her footsteps. "Yes," Artemis answered, "I will raise my child right. Once grown, I will become a hero greater than any other..." Artemis' smile grew slightly. "But I will need to kill Orion first, before he can rape another maiden." Apollo's ears perked up at that. He was itching to slay the sea spawn. Even though Poseidon is his favourite uncle, because he guided their mother - Leto - to the island of Delos to give birth to her twins, Orion was not going to have a lighter punishment. He would put Orion's head on a pike, torturing him to death. Apollo placed his hand on his sisters', rubbing circles on the back of it. "Then we kill him. No man rapes my sister and escapes punishment." Artemis nodded, weakly sitting up. Asclepius walked back into the room, a small smile on his lips. "Good news, Aunt Artemis. You are no longer fading. Now, would you two care for some soup before leaving?" Artemis nodded weakly. "That would be nice." ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Blood of the Moon ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Artemis looked around the forest, anxious. Her hunters were going to react badly to the news that she bore. Especially when they hear that Orion was the father of the child currently developing in her womb. The goddess placed a hand over her stomach once more, and tried sensing the developing egg. She could feel a small pulse of energy, bringing a small smile to her red lips. Artemis wanted her child to live a long, healthy, peaceful life - but knew she couldn't. Monsters would attack her child constantly because it would be her first - meaning that it will have a strong scent. Smoke raised high into the air, above the canopy of the forest. Silver tents were dotted around a small clearing in the woods. A number of twenty or so girls walked around the campsite, all
