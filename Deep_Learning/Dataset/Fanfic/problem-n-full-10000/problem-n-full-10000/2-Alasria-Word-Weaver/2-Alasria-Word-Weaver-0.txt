Disclaimer: I do not own Legolas, Thranduil, or anyone/thing else that is Tolkien's. (Come to think of it; if I did claim they were mine, I would either be insane, or plain stupid...) Eärion, Morilion, and several others (Uär, Lasen, Elidhiel) are mine. Do not steal them. Rating: T-ish Summary: Dark past comes to surface, as strife races through Eryn Lasgalen. No one is beyond the evil that clutches the forest. No one is above it. OF FIRE AND FOREST PROLOGUE Third age, 2647 Legolas stared in shock. The sight of the charred decimated trees and clearing tore at his elvish heart. The ring of forest around the clearing had also been burned to the ground. The forest surrounding the deathly site was also scorched and withered. He slowly guided his horse around the black stumps, the steed snorting its disgust at the acrid air. Within the center of the clearing had been the largest tree for miles. He slid off his horse, his elvish eyes squinting; they had caught sight of something. He gently fingered the jagged charcoal surface of the tree stump, tracing the etched letters. He sighed sadly, looking around at the carnage, then lightly leaped back onto his horse. He nodded to his comrade, and they continued their way silently to Thranduil's deep halls. But the single word was seared on his mind much like it was upon the dead tree. HERE. Chapter 1 Fourth age, 23 years after the crowning of the King The battle was not going well. A host of orcs, unlooked for had swept into the Mirkwood forest, making their way to the caves of Thranduil. Eärion, a young archer in the King's service, crouched in a tree, waiting for an opportunity to fell a goblin. The elves, because of their small numbers, were using an indirect attack method. Their numbers had started at about 50, which were far too few to combat the orcs face-to-grotesque face. Instead, they had arranged themselves along the course the orcs were following, in the foliage and in the trees. They had engaged the orcs along two areas within a mile. The first group, once beaten back, was to flee behind the second group, and assemble in hiding in the foliage once more, to rain down a barrage of arrows upon the near-helpless orcs. Then, once the second attack force had attacked-and been attacked, they would pass up the first attack force (now ahead of them) and wait until the orcs came in sight to fire upon them a second time. Eärion was part of the second force of two-dozen. The first group had fled past them a few minutes ago. But the first group had lost many more than they had expected - almost half. Yet there was no time to mourn their losses. The five hundred-strong army still marched on, driven with uncanny speed and agility through the eaves of Eryn Lasgalen. Eärion's pointed ears twitched, as the war-song of the goblins found its way through the trees. He shivered, their fell voices grating on his nerves. He slowly withdrew an arrow from his quiver, the grey fletching and shaft blending to become one swift, deadly weapon. He nocked the arrow, and drew the bowstring back to his ear, his slender, muscled arm tensing. His grey eyes squinted, as the harsh singing grew ever nearer. Orcs rushed along the narrow path, carrying torches, lighting the forest on fire as they went. Eärion let his arrow go, it flying straight at an orc, landing with a satisfying thunk in its chest. The orc screeched, then fell, as many more arrows flew out from the trees, each finding a target. Eärion took another arrow, and sent it hurtling towards the horde of goblins. This time, with the clamor of the orcs, he did not hear it hit its target. And neither did he see it. Eärion was blind. Legolas galloped along the narrow path through Mirkwood, the sun shining faintly through the eaves of the forest. A band of thirty Mirkwood warriors followed him, each upon a grey or brown horse. The attack of the orcs had been more than unexpected; it had been the first conflict since the crowning of King Elassar, and had taken all the elves of Eryn Lasgalen (Mirkwood) by surprise. The burning had been spotted the night before, and a troop of fifty elves (mostly archers), had been deployed. But a messenger had come back that morning, bringing news of the orcs. There were far more than they had thought, and though most of them were of the small kind that came from the Misty Mountains, at least a fifth of them were Uruk-Hai. Legolas was on his way with meager reinforcements to help the warriors holding back the army of orcs. It was ill fate that had the king and much of the population of Mirkwood away this week, thought Legolas. Indeed, it seemed like more than just coincidence… The orcs had begun to retaliate. Their archers were firing their short arrows into the trees, and though the elves were well camouflaged, some of the arrows hit their mark. Worse still, the Uruk-Hai had come up with axes, hacking away at the bases of the trees, both destroying the forest and sending the unseated archers crashing down at the same time. 'Eärion! We must retreat!' cried a familiar voice in the Elven tongue. Eärion glanced over to his left, towards the tree that held Lasen, his closest friend. Eärion could hear the loud commotion in front of him. The archers still able to fight had begun to engage the orcs with their knives. 'No! They have not sounded the retreat yet!' Eärion called back. 'The Captain has fallen! You cannot fight an orc hand to hand!' Eärion gritted his teeth, and closed his unseeing eyes. He had ever rued his lack of vision since being a child. 'Very well, then! We must assemble behind the first troop!' Eärion replied over the din. He felt for a branch grabbed it, and then swung down to the forest floor. Lasen quickly joined him. Lasen took a small, wood and silver horn from his belt, and blew upon it, sounding the retreat call. Eärion flinched at the loud noise, but had no time to protest. 'Quick-follow me.' Lasen had learned early in their friendship that Eärion, despite his handicap, could navigate the forest well, as long as he followed someone. So Lasen ran, with Eärion close behind. Gradually Eärion's ears could hear the uproar and chaos fall behind, though he could hear the quiet sounds of his fellow Elves slipping along through the forest around him. 'Here; climb into this tree. I'll be to the left.' Lasen whispered, as they stopped. Eärion nodded, and Lasen's light footsteps could be heard making their way to the next tree. Eärion quickly took a sip of water from the small water skin at his side. Then he waited for the orcs to come within range again. Legolas' horse pounded on, the faint shrieks of the battlefield reaching the prince's ears. They were close. He only hoped they had come in time, and with enough numbers. Legolas stopped as soon as he saw the waiting elves along the trail and in the trees. He called out to one of them. 'What news of the orcs?' 'Their numbers are still strong, my captain. Over 300. Our first group of warriors are engaging them right now.' The elf replied. ' And how are our numbers?' The elf paused before answering. Legolas dreaded the answer. 'It has been halved, sir. Two-dozen.' Legolas paused, the effects of the battle on his face. He sighed. He had to decide quickly what to do. He motioned to the five archers that had come with him. 'Stay with this group. The others and I will go on, and aid the warriors in battle. He dipped his head to the five, and they returned the salute. 'And may Elbereth help us.' Eärion, in fact, had been the elf talking to Legolas. After most the horses (he counted twenty-five by their hoof beats) had left, Lasen whispered to him from the other tree. 'Do you know who that was?' he said excitedly. 'No. Who was it?' asked Eärion. 'That was Legolas Greenleaf, the king's son!' Lasen replied. 'He was before the Gates of Morannon when the Dark Tower fell.' Eärion felt his heart rise. Legolas was a deadly combatant in battle, whether with arrow, or steel. 'It is good to have him, then. He is a great warrior.' 'Yes. 'We shall win the fight, I now believe.' Lasen replied, with a determined tone to his voice. Eärion nodded. The attack had been sudden, and their forces were very depleted, due to the absence of King Thranduil and much of his army. But the reinforces were here, along with a great hero of Middle Earth. He withdrew an arrow from his quiver. Legolas and his warriors charged into the mass of goblins. The forests' denseness was hindering them from getting all their forces in one place. Legolas clung to his bare-backed horse with his legs, his arrows flying from his hands in one fluid pattern. One, two, five, eight, twelve, seventeen - He subconsciously counted as he slew orc after orc. But it hardly seemed that the goblins' number was depleted at all. The Elves' numbers were too few, even if each elf slew 15 orcs each. It almost seemed as if the earth had ruptured from its very heart, spewing an endless river of filth and fangs. At last his arrows ran out. He drew his sword; knives were no weapons for on top of a horse. Previously, he had been circling the battle, always moving, to keep out of the way of arrows. His armor was light; for riding, and he did not want to test its strength. But now that his sword was his only weapon, he would have to risk the exposure. He swooped down with his sword, decapitating an Uruk-Hai. He blocked a passing blow to his chest, and severed an orc's arm. But the orcs were winning. Yes, they were cutting down the army in droves, but one by one, the elves were falling. And they could not take many more casualties. They were losing. They had to draw back to the archers, and hope they would take out enough orcs. Legolas sounded the retreat, then he waited for his men to go further into the forest. Eärion withdrew another arrow. He touched the few arrows that were left. Orcs had come around the other fighting band and had attacked them. His eyes were useless, but he did not need them. His ears, already aided by his elvish blood, had sharper hearing than all his friends. Their graceful curves, ending in a soft point, caught any noise, even a pebble dropping onto the grassy earth. He fired another arrow, and singled out the shriek that belonged to the now-dead orc. But they were losing. He needed no sight to know that. If the orcs had acted like they usually did, they would have fled after the second barrage of arrows penetrating their ranks. But no, they stayed. They stayed and fought, as if under a spell, and the lingering fear that gnawed at Eärion's stomach had only grown. Mingled with the brusque screams and yells of the orcs, were the moans and cries of elves. Elves that would die, either by slaughter of the orcs or by the slow, torturous pain of bleeding to death. Eärion gritted his teeth. Lasen called out from below. A cry of pain. "Lasen!" Eärion screamed. He leapt down from his perch, but then was uncertain on what to do. He was helpless, unable to do anything, no more useful than a rock. I can't see. Eärion's thinking blurred into one smeared, panicked thought. I CAN'T SEE! Eärion had never felt so useless. He barely had
