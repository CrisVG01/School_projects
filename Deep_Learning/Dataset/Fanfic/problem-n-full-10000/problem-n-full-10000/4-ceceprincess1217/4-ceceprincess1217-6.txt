Here is my entry to the Beyond The Bedroom contest pre-read by gabby 1027 & beta'd by Sunflower Fran. So, come and be penniless with me … Penniless England 1845 Isabella Swan sits staring at herself in the mirror while her maid, Jessica, finishes the intricate hairstyle. Her deep brown eyes survey the guest room at the country home of The Earl of Essex. It is the smallest of the homes owned by The Earl, which was specifically utilized to entertain. Tonight's gathering is sure to be full-scale debauchery of all manner. It is her first time at one of The Earl's parties and her first ever Courtesan Ball. It seems they combine the events this time to present new courtesans to the gentlemen. At eighteen years, Isabella has seen firsthand the cruel hard world of a courtesan's life. Having lost her virginity to the highest bidder a year ago, she foolishly fell in love. She had heard tales from other girls who had gone before her of how cruel some men could be. However, her benefactor was gentle and kind … almost loving. She could still feel him inside of her, his lips pressed against hers as she cried out in the purest of pleasure. When they were exhausted from their lovemaking, they fell asleep in each other arms waking once more to partake in the fruits of desire. Never, before had she experienced anything so blissful, and she wanted to have that feeling again with him. It was the single best experience of her life. She thought of him often, dreaming that he would come for her and perhaps offer her a contract. She did not have dreams of becoming his wife. She was more level headed than most girls. If he did offer her a contract, she knew her mother would oppose, due to his recent financial status. She had heard of his troubles and loss wanting nothing more than to seek him out and console him. The man she was certain held her heart was now penniless and in the middle of a great scandal. Isabella knew her mother, Renee Swan, cared for her, but she was a practical woman. Despite her obvious dislike for the gentleman, his lack of fortune made him utterly unsuitable to provide for her daughter. Renee knew how to hand select a benefactor. She was aware that her ability to provide for herself and her family only went as far as her current lover. As a widow with two toddling girls to feed, she had sacrificed everything to keep them together. She could have abandoned the children to the church or worse, but instead, she chose to lift her petticoats and save her family and home. She diligently practiced frugality, a lesson learned early. She cut corners wherever it was necessary, in order to save a guinea here and there, until eventually, she was in possession of a small fortune. Renee hoped her nest egg would provide for her when she could no longer entertain gentlemen callers. However, her love for the cards was proving more financially bothersome than she had expected. She tried to instill the importance of taking care of oneself to her daughters. Renee Swan's mantra in life; husbands die, beauty fades and bodies become old. Isabella had ideas of love, but not necessarily grandeur. Having had one sexual experience, one night of passion, there would only ever be one man for her. The Earl of Essex himself. She had only seen him in passing since that fateful night one year ago, as she was not allowed to attend any parties her mother hosted or attended until she was of age. Being the daughter of Renee Swan did not provide Bella with many options. In truth, no titled gentleman would marry the offspring of both a prostitute and a farmer. There were whispers of her distinct beauty within the Ton, which prompted many gentlemen to send inquiries for her services, and if any were to be secured, they would come tonight. Isabella's sister, Angela, was a wealthy mistress in her own right. Her protector, the Duke of Lancaster, Michael Newton, was an older man who adored her and indulged her every whim. Being a widower gave him leave to spend his free time with his mistress and society would not dare question the Duke. **Penniless** The bedchamber door quietly opened as her mother, elegantly dressed in a crimson red gown and artistically painted face entered. Renee preferred to never be without her face painted to perfection or her person covered in the finest jewelry. Angela took after her mother, but Isabella preferred very little paint and rouge, wanting to show her natural beauty. "Darling, are you ready? We must not be late. Every courtesan in England will be trying to secure the best gentlemen," her mother says. "Carlisle informed me that his closest friend is in want of a mistress." Isabella turned, placing a smile upon her face. "Really? Is it The Earl of Essex? Is he not to be married this Saturday?" she asked as a wave of excitement coursed through her veins. Would God be so kind as to give her the man of her every waking dream to be her protector? "Not The Earl of Essex himself! What sort of mama would I be if I allowed that dreadful man to touch you again? I only agreed because Carlisle practically insisted on his cousin's behalf and of course I received the funds in full." She says with disdain in her voice." Indeed, I am speaking of Viscount Wentworth." Renee takes her daughter by the hand perusing her person for anything out of place. Her gown is exquisite, the dark purple bringing out her pale skin. Isabella takes a calming breath, trying to hide her disappointment. Her mother only wants what is best for her; there is nothing to be done about her infatuation with The Earl. She must secure a gentleman, a wealthy gentleman and The Earl of Essex is now penniless. Once Isabella's person is deemed appropriate, they exit the room and walk down the long hallway. The house is beautiful; the dark blue carpet with intricate gold designs feels like heaven against her feet, its lush softness gives her a feeling of walking on air. The crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling sparkle like the sun on a hot summer day; as if they were polished recently for the guests. As Isabella's eyes sweep around the country home of The Earl of Essex, she thought to herself … if this was the sign of a penniless Earl, then she would gladly be one herself. When the ladies reached the end of the long staircase, they observed Baron Mansfield, Carlisle Cullen, awaiting them at the foot of the stairs. His blue eyes danced from mother to daughter. "What a vision you both are. I shall be considered the luckiest of gentlemen entering with you two on my arms," Carlisle said smiling. "Oh, Carlisle, how you dote on us! Has Angela and the Duke arrived?" Renee asked as they turned towards the ballroom. "I have not seen them as of yet. Each new courtesan is present, and now it is time to introduce the loveliest one of all," Carlisle says as they entered the large room that is cleared for dancing and debauchery. A number of settees and chairs have been situated around the room, leaving a small dance floor. Many occupants of these seats are participating in various forms of sexual acts. Isabella's wandering eyes fall upon The Marquis of Dublin, Aro Volturi, taking Jane Winters against the wall. Jane's mouth was agape, her eyes shut in what seemed agony as her fingers gripped the shoulders of his waistcoat while his large hands grasped her bare bottom causing her to arch. Isabella envied that woman's pleasure. Although Renee began training her to please a man when she was naught but fourteen years of age, she felt that she would never know such bliss … again. As all eyes turn to Isabella, she holds her head high. She knows that every gentleman is scrutinizing her from head to toe and a small smile plays on her lips. Her mother has taught her that she must always put on a show. Butterflies dance in the pit of her belly as most of the gentlemen look upon her with hungry, lust-filled eyes. Several approach, encroaching on her for a dance or a word as she holds firmly onto Carlisle's arm as if it were her very lifeline. Her mother steps back to allow the admirers to swarm around her. Renee Swan smiles broadly, as the gentlemen state their offers for her daughter. "Renee, I do believe you have been hiding this treasure from me," Viscount Wentworth, Emmett McCarty, said as he peered at the lovely Isabella. "I've heard of her beauty from Carlisle and insisted on an introduction." With a generous smile, Renee gently touches the Viscount on his coat sleeve as she speaks. "Carlisle has informed me of your interest. Of course, you will need to draw up a generous contract that would secure her future if you were to end the relationship or if you were to perish." Renee lists off her demands counting her commission in her head. "Is she agreeable?" The Viscount asks, licking his lips; his gaze running the length of Isabella's body as Carlisle escorts her around the room, introducing her to a few gentlemen. "My dear Viscount, how could she not be?" Renee squeezes his muscle batting her eyelashes. Across the room, The Earl of Essex, Edward Cullen, sips his drink, lazily trying to calm the stir in his cock as he watches her. This was his last party before his wedding to Miss Hale and her twenty thousand pounds. My God, he needs her dowry to save his family and his lands, but the sight of the creature in front of him made him want to say to hell with family and honor. Despite his recent troubles, with his fool of a brother, Jacob, he insisted on hosting this gathering of flesh although he knew he could hardly afford to entertain. His sole purpose was to get a taste of the sweetest nectar one last time. Isabella Swan. His only thought was claiming the beautiful brunette as his own, possessing her body the way no other gentleman ever will. From the moment he laid eyes on her, a mere girl, his body hungered to have her. When he learned from his cousin, Carlisle that Renee Swan was taking offers, he knew it was his chance. That was last year, and his thoughts were even more fervent now. Even after all that had happened … he still held out hope … His gaze never leaves her person as Carlisle escorts her around the room. He could almost feel her pink pouty lips wrapped around his cock. She was so inexperienced the night he guided her in the art of pleasuring him. Her wide doe eyes staring up at him with trust and purity. God, he's hard just thinking about it. From his vantage point, he watches as his friend, Emmett, Viscount Wentworth, openly gapes at her. A fierce surge of jealousy attacks Edward causing him to want to slice him, and every other man in the room open for even daring to look at what is his. For there is no doubt in his mind that she will be his before the night is over. But … can that ever be enough? **Penniless** Isabella takes a deep breath, enjoying the claret wine as the cool liquid slips down her throat. She tries to no avail to calm her nerves as her skin prickles. Every turn about the room, men leer at her as if she were a prize mare for them to mount. All their attention had her skin crawling. All but one. The dark evergreen gaze of The Earl
