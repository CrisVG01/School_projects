R/R!!! **************************************************************************** ***** Chapter 1: "A promise kept." The apartment floor was cold as the little five-year-old girl slowly tip toed into her mother's room. She was spread out on her bed with her face facing her daughter. She was sleeping. The little blonde sat in front of her mother staring. "Why are you staring at me?" the woman asked with her eyes still closed. "To see if you drool like aunt Lauren said." The little girl replied. The older version of the younger girl opened one eye and smiled. "Do you always believe everything your aunt tells you?" Trinity asked sitting up on her bed. "Um.... pretty much." The little girl, whose name was Reagan, said. (AN: I love that name he he) Trinity smirked and got up. She ruffled Reagan's hair. "Hey!" Reagan said. Trinity walked into the bathroom. She started to brush her teeth. Reagan stood atop the toilet to look at her mother in the mirror. "Hey mom, for breakfast can I have ice cream?" Reagan asked slyly. Her mother frowned at her and raised an eyebrow. "Can I?" Reagan asked slipping off the toilet seat slowly. "Mffm eaht atah diren wfith tha gierls." Trinity said with her mouth full of toothpaste. "I'll take that as a yes." Reagan said and ran out of the bathroom. Trinity quickly spit out and rinsed her mouth. She ran after her daughter. She had gotten the stool and was going to open the freezer door when her mother grabbed her and held her upside down. Reagan giggled madly. "You know the rules. No ice cream for breakfast! Plus we're going to meet the girls at the diner for breakfast before school." Trinity said. "Now go brush your teeth." Trinity set her daughter down. Her daughter hesitated. But then rushed out of the kitchen when her mom gave her a look. Trinity walked to the refrigerator. There were pictures of her and the girls. They had all moved out of the apartment and Jo had stayed since originally it was her apartment. Marley and Jihan lived together in an apartment building not far from the old one they all shared. Lauren lived in the same apartment building a few floors down. Trinity had gotten a quaint two bedroom apartment 5 minutes away from all of them. They all met once a week for breakfast at the diner Lizzy used to work at. Lizzy had finally fell into the pressure of all of them bugging her to go back to school for her drawing. She had always been great at it. Now she had her own little studio in Manhattan. Trinity smiled as she looked at the picture of her and her daughter. Spitting image of her and Legolas. Her heart grew heavy. Legolas and the other's still hadn't returned. Reagan had stopped asking so much when her father would come home since she knew every time her mother answered she always got sad. Trinity has told her that her father was in a far away country helping people in need and that he would be home soon. But, honestly Trinity had started to lose hope. "Hurry up mom! We're going to be late!" Reagan called. Trinity snapped out of her trance and followed her daughter out of the kitchen. **************************************************************************** ***** The steam from the coffee slowly drifted up from the white mug. It slowly bent and swayed as if doing a dramatic solo... 'God what the hell am I thinking. I'm not writing a damn novel here.' Jo thought. She was sitting down in the booth of the diner waiting for the girls to come. Jo reached in her purse to see what time it was. 10 past 8. As she put her watch back a picture fell out. It was of her and Aragorn. She was yelling at him and he was staring at her with a bored expression on his face. She smiled weakly. 'God I miss him. So much...' she thought. But now she had Sean in her life. She couldn't be thinking about him when she was with someone else. 'What are the chances of him coming back. I don't even know if he's still alive' she said in her head. She stirred the coffee with her spoon slowly and looked at her reflection in the rain-drenched window. At 35, Jo thought she looked pretty damn good. Her hair was cut shorter. Just slightly past her chin. It flipped out to the side. Her face was soft and tight. No wrinkles yet. Her lips were full and pouty. Her bright gray eyes looked right back at her. The rain kept coming down like bullets. The New York sky looked as if I were night. "You look fine Jo. You know if I didn't know you I'd say you were a person who only cares about your appearance." A voice said behind her. Jo looked to the image above her in the window. It was Marley. She had layered her hair and changed its dark chestnut color to a lighter brown. Other than that she was the still lovable Marley. "Well its good that you know me then." She said. "Eh I guess you can say that. Depends on which situation we're in. So are we going to continue talking via reflections in the window?" Marley said. Jo chuckled. "No. How are you Marley?" Jo asked turning around and hugging her. "I've been better. That Julio guy asked me out again. He said and I quote: I's make you ave these time of your life." Marley said in a Spanish accent. Jo laughed. "Why don't you say yes then? So you can get him off your back?" Jo asked. "Are you kidding me! He's a loser. I mean he spends more time looking in the mirror than me! Now that's saying something. Plus I don't think I want to be in a relationship right now." "Is it because of Merry? Marley! It's been Six years! They still haven't come back!" Jo said. "Ok. First off I have gone on dates ok. Second, just because you moved on doesn't mean we all have!" Marley said furiously. "Hey Marley you're here. Can I get you anything while you wait for the others?" Sheila, the waitress, asked. "Coffee." Marley said. She nodded and walked away. "Hey! Sean came into my life at the right time when all I could think about was Aragorn and I was slowly sinking into a depression. Anyway, it's not like I still don't think about Aragorn or forget how much I love him. I'm just slowly coming to realize that he may not come back." Jo said sipping her coffee. "Sometimes wars take long to fight!" Marley said. Jo sighed. "Marley. Look. I'm not going to break it off with Sean because you still have this crazy idea that the guys are actually going to come back. Besides do you have anything against Sean?" Jo asked. "No of course not! I love Sean! He got me those last minute Elvis Castillo tickets! He's a great guy. But what are you going to do if by chance Aragorn and the others come back?" Marley said. Jo thought about it. She sighed. "I guess I'll have to deal with it when it happens." She responded. "Here ya go! Some nice hot coffee on a day like this." Sheila said handing her a cup of coffee. "Thanks Sheila." Marley said taking it. Sheila smiled and walked away. "Oh look. Here's Jihan. She told me to leave without her. There's Lauren to." Jo turned to see Lauren and Jihan. They smiled and waved. "Man it's a hurricane out there!" Lauren said sitting down next to Jo. She shrugged off her soaking wet jacket. "You're telling me." Marley said. "Reagan! Be careful! Your going to slip and hurt yourself." A voice called. They looked to see Trinity and Reagan. Reagan was running towards them as Trinity walked behind her closing an umbrella. "Hey aunt Jo, Marley, Lauren, Jihan!" Reagan said happily running up to their table. "Hey munchkin!" Lauren said sitting her up and on her lap. Trinity sat next to Jihan. "Man it's raining cats and dogs." Trinity said loosening her blonde hair out of its clip. "OOO! Hey aunt Jo! You wanna know what new word I learned yesterday!" Reagan asked excitedly bouncing up and down on Lauren's lap. "MM.... Riddlin?" Jo mentioned, observing Reagan's hyperactive self. "Noooo! Recalcitrant!" Reagan said happy that she pronounced it correctly. "Really. Reminds me of you." Jo said teasingly. "Well I don't know if that's good or not because I don't really know what it means. I just heard Mrs. Towsley say it to Bobby Michaels! Who by the way I think is the biggest dweed because I told him that I like him but he said that he thought that I was pretty but he didn't like me because he likes Michelle Fitherpither. Who I think has the stupidest name in the world! But she doesn't like Bobby because she likes Jack O' Meyers but Jack doesn't like Michelle because he likes me but I don't like him because he has this black spot on the side of his nose that I always think is a booger so that's why I started to call him Jack O' Booger!" Reagan explained very fast. They all stared at her. "Wow.... when I was in Kindergarten all I was worried about was trying to remember all the letters of the alphabet." Marley said. "I had no idea that now kindergarteners lives were slowly becoming an episode of some soap opera." They all laughed. "Sorry I'm late. I spent all night working on my latest piece that I totally forgot to set my alarm clock." Lizzy said sitting down next to Lauren. "Oh well you didn't miss much except perhaps Reagan's life version of an episode of Days of our lives." Marley said. "I'm not even going to ask." Lizzy said. "All right the gang's all here! What'll it be." Sheila asked coming up to their table. "The usual." Jo said. "Ok! They'll be ready in a couple of minutes." Sheila said smiling and walking away. "Why is she always smiling?" Reagan asked. "She thinks that she'll get a bigger tip from us." Jo said pouring more sugar in her coffee. "She's trying to become a model so she's practicing her smile." Lizzy said. "She actually thinks she'll make it. Do you know how many girls are coming to New York to become a model? She doesn't have a chance." Marley said. "Oh your just jealous Marley because you were too short to become one." Trinity said. "Hey I think that they should have more models who are an average height of 5'5! There are a lot of petite women out there!" Marley argued. "Why don't you try telling that to the modeling agencies." Lauren said. "I have. Now they think I'm too short and that I have an attitude problem." Marley said. They all laughed. "I don't think your that short, Marley." Reagan said. "Oh God bless your soul!" Marley said smiling at her and putting her hand over her heart. "Hey Jo, Sean's coming back today right?" Lauren said. "Yeah. He was in Paris on a business trip as usual." Jo said. "Man he's always on one. Don't you get sick and tired of it?" Jihan asked. "Yeah. It gets pretty lonely. But he always has a surprise for me when he gets home." Jo said smiling. "Oh. Yeah I remember the last thing he gave. That diamond necklace. Was that thing really real?" Marley asked. "For the
