A/N: So, this is something that I have been working on for the last few months in between writing my WIP's. It was a whole lot of fun to write and my first oneshot of this magnitude. The Importance of Breeding Once Harry's body disappeared from Hagrid's arms, the chaos of fatal dueling filled the air. The snake was dead! Neville had beheaded the revolting thing with the sword of Gryffindor and Hermione couldn't have been more relieved if she tried. She could have wept in happiness with how close they were to the end. Not only that but Harry was really alive! Hermione turned back to the fight around her, shooting off curses left and right, helping seasoned and green fighters alike. As she spotted Ginny and Luna being targeted by Bellatrix, she sped up, only disarming the opponents in her way, letting the more experienced fighters take care of their opponent's new vulnerability. She sent the spell indiscriminately and wands rolled to her feet or flew to her through the air. It made her smile. One even flew into her hand and it felt warm and comforting as if it had known her touch before but she dropped it to the floor at her feet. Hermione was running on adrenaline, her hair whipping crazily around her as Luna, Ginny, and Hermione stepped in to duel with Bellatrix Lestrange. With an especially strong curse from the manic witch, the three girls were thrown back and Molly Weasley charged forward like a crazed bull. "Not my daughter, you bitch!" She snarled and Hermione could only admire the fire in Molly as the two women dueled. Molly Weasley was a woman of skill and power and this was proof. Bellatrix taunted her and played with her as she did with all of the people who dared come against her. It was mid-laugh that Bellatrix fell, a killing curse straight to her chest. Molly was triumphant and the roar of Voldemort echoed around the ruined hall as he saw his best and most devout follower fall. He threw back those that were fighting against him as if they were rag dolls and Harry Potter stepped into the fight. "He's mine! It's got to be like this. It's got to be me." Harry said. Hermione picked herself off the floor and watched as Harry squared off against Voldemort, taunting him with information that changed the tides of war. Snape was always Dumbledore's man- had loved Lily more than life- and gave everything to help Harry win. It was down to one spell, one fluke. Would the elder wand know of its true master? As Harry yelled 'Expelliarmus', Voldemort yelled 'Avada Kedavra'. The spells were cast and Hermione couldn't bear the thought of losing Harry again just when she had him back. Casting a silent confundus, Hermione watched as her spell hit Harry who stumbled two steps to the left and Voldemort's spell landed in the crowd. Minerva McGonagall was hit with the killing curse. The side of the light watched in horror as she crumpled to the ground, dead. The elder wand went flying high, back to its master, and Harry reached up to pluck it from the air. Soaring high over his head, the death stick landed in Hermione's open palm, the wand shooting glowing sparks into the air after successfully reuniting with its master. The entire battlefield was silent. Voldemort's red eyes gleamed as he considered her, a new powerful adversary. Before she was just the intelligent Mudblood that kept Potter alive. Now she was infinitely more interesting. He tore his gaze off of her frozen face and grabbed the nearest living Death Eater and disapparated away, the rest of his minions quickly following suit if they were able. "How?" Hermione mumbled in horror, Harrys face an identical mask from where he still stood in the now empty circle of spectators. "It was you? I hoped I was just being clumsy with it." Harry looked at Draco's wand as if it had betrayed him as if he should have known that Hermione had disarmed him in her bid to reach Bellatrix to help her friends stay alive. Hermione blanched, she had been firing off Expelliarmuses like they were cheap tricks, disarming many people, only minutes ago, during the heat of the resumed battle. "Harry," She choked. He moved toward her through the crowd and encased her in his shaking arms. "He knows too. There is no hiding it." "What should I do?" "I don't know but we will figure it out, just like we always do." He murmured into her hair as she felt Ron come up behind her and encircle her in his arms as well. The side of the light had begun moving around- taking prisoners, separating the dead from those who needed medical attention, and pulling everyone out and away from destroyed castle. No one was safe there and it was not a school anymore. Hogwarts was just another casualty of war. The boys pulled away from Hermione. Ron ambled back to his family who were clustered around the dead body of Fred and Harry went off to talk to Kingsley about their next move. They almost ended this whole war. Had Hermione not disarmed Harry moments before he stepped into the ring with Voldemort, the war would be over, and Voldemort would be dead. The bitterness nearly suffocated her. It was all her fault that Voldemort was still living. People milled around her in a mild state of panic, apparating away to a safe location that Kingsley set up just in case. A soft but firm hand slipped into hers. Hermione gave Luna a tight smile that was more a grimace than pleasure. With a nod, Hermione allowed Luna to apparate her away to the new safe house, a newly warded and deconsecrated church somewhere in the middle of nowhere. A place that used to be a town but no longer was for whatever reason. Hermione let go of Luna's hand and walked unseeingly through her new safe haven. Not a word left her lips as she descended into the pits of madness where she relived the moment the Elder wand landed in her hands and she realized that she was the reason that the war was not over. Every single death from here on out was her fault, all her fault. It was on a continuous loop in her brain. **HGHG** Draco flinched as Voldemort smacked the table at Malfoy Manor with his hand. His mother was on the floor, dying from the wounds inflicted on her in between bouts of the Cruciatus. Her life's blood was seeping into the priceless rug that was soaking up the growing pool. His father and he stared at her, wands of their brethren at their throats. Voldemort's order had been clear. One movement, one twitch in her direction and they would meet the same fate. Perhaps his father would have followed her to the floor but with Draco's life in the balance and the possible extinction of the Malfoy name, he dared not. It was his deep-rooted belief that blood mattered that held him immobile. Draco had once been of that belief too, perhaps he still was, but now his motivations were more selfish. He just wanted this to be over. He never wanted anything so bad as when he was standing in Hogwarts hoping that Harry Potter would come through and defeat the bastard. He kept all of this to himself and lowered his head in further supplication. There was no way out for him now. He had become a Death Eater whether he had wanted it or not and that meant no desertions, no freedom, no status. The Malfoys were lower than low. The biggest disappointments that nearly cost Voldemort the entire war. Narcissa began choking on the blood that was flooding her lungs and a tear slipped down Draco's cheek. His mother had loved him, tried to protect him as best as she could, and he didn't want her to die. The way the blood bubbled from her lips as she exhaled for the final time would forever haunt him, waking or asleep. He was going to go to hell or whatever awaited people like him in the afterlife. Voldemort turned on them with a savage glee, stalking toward their frozen forms. They still watched her, silently begged her to be stronger, to take another breath. She didn't and Draco looked up into the red slitted eyes of his master. "Do you see what I must do to those who betray me?" He hissed softly, moving closer to Draco. Draco nodded. He dared do nothing else. "To make sure this resistance is stamped out of the once noble and proud Malfoy line, I will be instructing you myself. Lucius will await his punishment in the dungeons." Death Eaters that had been holding his father, moved him out of the dining room and presumably into the dungeons. "I lost my best and most fierce warrior today. Your Aunt Bellatrix was a credit to you. I am sorry for her loss." Although Voldemort whispered his condolences, it was clear he didn't actually care. Her death was a blow because she was the most loyal and crazed of his followers. Draco held back a shudder. "You can thank her memory for my leniency." "Thank you, My Lord." Draco murmured docility. He stared at his mother's body, still on the floor and felt sick and trapped. "I will see you for breakfast tomorrow." Voldemort dismissed him, waving a few of his other followers to dispose of his mother's body. It was too much to hope for that Voldemort would let him bury her in the family plot. "Oh, and Draco, If I catch you anywhere near the dungeons, your father will bear the brunt of my displeasure." Draco bowed deeply, staring at his shoes until he could no longer hear Voldemort's footsteps and vomited on the same rug that drank his mother's blood. Draco wiped his mouth and turned on his heel, retreating to the sanctuary of his room. He couldn't look back and see her dead anymore. He was at his breaking point. The next morning Draco sat stiffly to Voldemort's right. He picked at his food, refusing to meet anyone's eyes as he tried to become invisible. For the most part, they let him. Only sending him sidelong glances once in a while. Probably wondering what he had earned to be seated as Voldemort's right-hand man. They could take it. He didn't want it. "Dolohov," Voldemort began. "I need you to create a spell for me. See me after breakfast." "Yes, My Lord." He muttered deferentially. **HGHG** Hermione was dead inside. That is, she was consumed with the guilt of dooming the entire world to Voldemort's dominion. It had been six months since the battle at Hogwarts. The resistance kept fighting, kept moving forward making themselves stronger- taking out Voldemort's soldiers. Harry now led raids and Ron led other fighters. Kingsley had begged her in the days following May second to also take a wing of fighters. She couldn't do it. She couldn't be responsible for even more deaths. She retreated inside herself and books, refusing to talk to anyone- even Harry and Ron. They assured her over and over that it wasn't her fault, that it was a cruel twist of fate, but she wouldn't be consoled. It was her fault. It was. Every mission they came back with less and less of the living and more and more of the dead. She spent time with them, the dead. She bathed them- prepared them for burial. It may have been morbid but it was the least she could do. The dead were seared into her brain. She would never forget. The peaceful still faces of the people she came to care about. Ginny, Hagrid, Katie Bell, Amos Diggory, and so many more. She was there now, with
