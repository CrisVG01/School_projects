Harry Potter and the Blessed Blood Blessing ***Despite my plans to eventually own things, Harry Potter will never be one of them. *** Note: Neville is going to be referenced as a 'blonde' because that is what the author considers him in the actual book. ***HPBB*** Lily Potter hastily drew yet another symbol upon her young son's forehead. Both her and James knew what was coming, they could feel it in their bones. Voldemort would find them sooner or later and when he did… She had to finish this last act, possibly the last thing she would ever do in her life. She had to ensure that Harry would survive, that he would be safe from harm. They had both heard the prophecy, were both aware of what it meant. The problem was that Dumbledore was an arse and would undoubtedly find some way to twist the entire situation to his favor. That and the fact that there was little hope a mere child would ever gain enough experience and power to out duel the Dark Lord himself, who would have well over fifty years of experience on the boy. Their only hope, his only hope, was to figure out 'the power he knows not'. When it had been first revealed Dumbledore, in his infinite wisdom, began muttering about 'the power of love and friendship' or some such bullshit. Luckily neither of Harry's parents were willing to risk his life and future on vague ideals of hugging the Dark Lord into submission. Also fortunate was the fact that they had access, through James, to forbidden and forgotten magic of the Potter family. That, coupled with the knowledge and skills of the two most skilled magical users of their generation, provided a glimmer of hope. An ancient ritual designed to strengthen and enhance the power of one's blood, except that it would be enhanced, Lily was considered a genius after all, and magnified to a terrifying degree which shouldn't be possible even in the world of magic. At least that was what Lily hoped. An explosion sounded from the ground floor, the sound of a door being blasted to pieces. A shout from her husband followed quickly after as the air began to fill with the excess magic of a duel. She had to complete the task now . "Blessed be the blood of my blood." She muttered, drawing another small symbol on the child's forehead. "Protect the blood of my blood, keep him safe, keep him strong, and allow…" A sickening green light filled the house, and she felt her heart die a bit… her husband was dead and she was sure to follow. The only hope left was to save her son. Minutes later, and despite the pleas of a desperate mother, a bolt of green energy ripped Lily Potter's soul from her body, leaving her only child unprotected. A single incantation followed, and once more the house was filled with a green glow, before all grew silent once more. Save for the crying of an innocent baby. ***HPBB*** "FREAK, GET IN HERE NOW!" Said small child slowly entered the room, his eyes staring at the floor as he had been 'taught' to do since early on in his life. Seconds later he was attacked from the side by his cousin, who proceeded to begin practicing his 'wrestling moves' on the smaller child. Harry would pass out seconds later, while his aunt and uncle laughed on from the other side of the room. ***HPBB*** "I have a package here for a Mr. Harry…" "There is no Harry here now leave!" Petunia promptly slammed the door in the man's face, before turning and leaving for the kitchen, muttering the entire time. Little did she know that inside the cupboard under the stairs a young boy had heard just enough to make a startling connection. With eagerness befitting a child at Christmas Harry began to make small scratches with his worn-out fingernails into the wall, hidden from view unless one sat inside the cupboard itself. 'H…A…R…R…Y' He finally had a name, and he would never allow himself to forget it. ***HPBB*** "I TOLD YOU FREAK, IF YOU DIDN'T FINISH THEN NO SUPPER!" With this declaration the larger man grabbed ahold of the child, and threw him roughly into the closet before locking it from the outside. It wasn't his fault. He had almost gotten done with weeding the elaborate garden in the back yard before Dudley had come barging through and ruined half of the plants. This, of course, was blamed on Harry and he had been forced to sit still while being sprayed off with the garden hose to get the dirt off. "Can't have you tracking mud through my beautiful house freak!" Petunia snarled, as her son turned up the pressure causing welts and bruises to appear on the boy's skin. 'Maybe… it is my fault… maybe I deserve this…' the young boy thought as he was confined to the darkness of his personal jail. It had been like this for as long as he could remember, and despite knowing that the same rules did not seem to apply to his cousin… it was obvious that something was wrong with him to deserve such treatment. He was just a freak after all. ***HPBB*** "Freak get in here this instance! Dudlekins needs his wrestling practice." Nodding in obedience the boy walked into the living room, his head bowed as had become the norm with him. Within moments he found himself in various painful positions, his muscles and skin being pulled in awkward angles, and his bones straining in discomfort. The last thing he remembered before blacking out from a choke hold, was the smiling faces of his two 'guardians'. ***HPBB*** It is truly amazing what children will do to survive, even resorting to stealing food in the very house they live in. A quick 'sleight of hand' and an apple would seemingly vanish out of a fruit bowl into a young boy's hand. When the situation was dire enough the human mind will adapt to just about anything, a normally vibrant and curious personality will be stifled if questions and expressions lead to physical harm. If eye contact leads to hatred and scorn then one need only to keep their head bent. Spending hours upon hours outside toiling in the soil would give one quite the education involving plants and how to care for them. Yet there are times that despite all of the ways in which a person can change and overcome an obstacle will emerge that simply cannot be passed, a mountain too high to climb. Thus, despite all of his physical pains and stresses Harry Potter remained physically small and weak. Every day, he felt exhausted no matter how much food he would steal or how many chores he performed. There was always something that seemed wrong, as if he was being weighted down and suppressed. As if a part of him was being denied. ***HPBB*** Harry Potter was busy dusting the living room, while the others sat and watched television, when a letter slid under the doorway. A letter addressed to 'Harry Potter'. The black-haired boy paused then glanced back as if to ask permission to touch the envelope, he had learned after the one time he hadn't that the consequences would be quite painful. "Go ahead freak, mail ain't gonna pick itself up!" "Yes sir" Upon retrieving the letter he froze, and slowly began to open the envelope when he was knocked into the wall by a large fist. "DON'T OPEN WHAT AINT YOURS FREAK!" "V-Vernon…" The man glanced over to his terrified wife, who gestured towards the letter in her hand. Returning his attention to the prone child below him Mr. Dursely finished by delivering a stomp to the boy's head, knocking him unconscious. ***HPBB*** "What do we do?" "I already told you he ain't gonna be learning from those freaks!" Harry blinked his eyes open, realizing he was once more in his 'room' and that there was a conversation going on nearby, probably about him by the anger in the tone of his uncle. "You don't understand Vernon; these freaks aren't going to just stop with one letter. If he doesn't reply they will send someone to find him." "Let them try, we will just go on vacation and…" "They will find us Vernon… It was the same way with my sister. I don't like it any more than you do but… this way we avoid having to deal with them and we won't have to see him for nine months of the year. Think about it darling… nine months without that little monster." The locked-up child could practically see his uncle's slowly forming grin. "Well when you put it like that…" ***HPBB*** "Albus now that the school year is fast approaching we need to go over the first years who will have a staff member assigned to introduce them to the magical world." "Ah yes of course Minerva please go down the list." The other teachers sat anxiously, there was a certain… experience… to be given such a task. Sure, there was the initial stress and anxiety that went with trying to convince normal everyday people to believe in magic, and to send off their young child to attend a school they had never heard of. But there was also that . Seeing a child's eyes light up in amazement when a simple spell was performed for the first time was an experience that none could wave off as being 'trivial'. After most of the list had been gone through McGonagall paused, before glancing around hesitantly. "Harry Potter" Snape gave his usual sneer and snorted in annoyance. Dumbledore's eyes began twinkling with an unusual brightness. "Who… has the child been living with all this time Headmaster? You never did inform us." "And for good reason I am afraid Filius. Despite the war being over there have been numerous death threats against young Mr. Potter's life. He has been hidden away under powerful wards and with a normal muggle family to raise him to be modest and caring rather than concerned with fame and fortune." "Hmph, I am sure the brat will be just as full of himself as his father was." "Now now Severus I am sure he is quite the young man by now." "So Albus who is going to be assigned to…" "I do not believe that will be necessary Minerva, I have spoken with his guardians and they have assured me that he has been well informed of the magical world and his place in it, along with his parents. I suggest we keep away from this topic as the year begins though, there is no reason to open old wounds." ***HPBB*** Harry was dropped off unceremoniously at the train station that he was to report to. Vague instructions alluding to a 'Platform Nine and three quarters' were all the instructions he received from his uncle. That and the threat that he had better not come back before the next summer. If he somehow couldn't find a way to get to school then he had to fend for himself for the next nine months. Glancing around the young boy shivered in his worn-out clothing. All he had been allowed to take was a falling apart suitcase and some dirty clothes stuffed inside. Hopefully the school would provide the books. Harry had never been in public like this before, having seldom left the house save for doing chores, and began his wanderings to try and find his destination. He finally reached platform nine, and noticed platform ten next to it but… There was no signs, no instructions, no professors… what kind of school was this? Maybe it was a trick? His 'family' had certainly wanted to be rid of him for some time now, perhaps this was the best way they could think of? Elevate his hopes and dreams and
