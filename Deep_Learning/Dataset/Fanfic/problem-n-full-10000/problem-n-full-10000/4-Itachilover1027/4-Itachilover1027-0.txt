Meeting of Two Hearts A/N: This story was originally written by me and my sister and since she's busy with other stories and doesn't have much time for this story she decided to give it to me to rewrite so I hope you all enjoy. This is the first story I've ever written so please bare with me on my mistakes. I own nothing but a few made up characters. Chapter 1: (Akiko's P.O.V) So far it's been a slow night at the bar that I worked at called the Hunters Lounge; John another bartender like myself was in the back storage room taking inventory while I was in the front getting the karaoke stage ready for the usual crowed tonight, usually we have a live band playing on Friday nights but our boss was too lazy to book a band so we were stuck doing karaoke instead. " Hey Akiko what time is it" I heard John yell from the back, I looked up at the clock "It's 7:30, the stage is almost ready" I yelled back as I finished putting the mic up. Once the stage was ready I went up to the bar and began prepping it, just as I finished cleaning off the counter John came in sighing " You ready for the craziness" I smiled at him knowing he was joking but I nodded anyways, I gasped when he opened the door and herds of people came pouring in. A few hours after we opened things at the bar finally began to slow down so I took the opportunity to pull out my journal from under the counter and I began writing; a little while later I was pulled out of my thought when I heard someone in front of me clear their throat, when I looked up I saw the most handsome man I've ever seen standing across from me "Sorry to interrupt your thinking ma'am but can I please get a Budweiser please" the man asked "Can I see your ID please" he nodded as he handed me his ID, once I checked it I handed it back to him and I turned to grab his beer placing it in front of him as he handed me his money. I turned to go to the other side of the bar but John stopped me by placing his large hand on my shoulder "Honey it's pretty slow right now so why don't you take your break and relax, Jenny and I can handle things for a while" I thanked him as I grabbed my journal again and I walked over to an empty booth in the corner of the room and I began writing once again before I was interrupted again by the man from a little while ago "Sorry for interrupting you again but do you mind if I join you" I nodded and he sat in the seat across from me holding out his hand "I'm Sam Uley" I smiled as I took his hand and shook it "I'm Akiko" I said softly, he lends his head down and he kissed my hand causing me to blush "It's a pleasure meeting you Ms. Akiko, what are you working on if you don't mind me asking" he asked as he looked down at my notebook "Oh I'm just writing some lyrics for a song I'm working on" he nodded before he took a long drink from his beer "Do you think I could hear it sometime" he asked, I nodded before I turned to the stage seeing that it was empty now so I got up and I gently pulled him towards the stage; I grabbed my guitar from the back and I began playing causing everyone eyes to turn towards me but I just ignored them as I began singing: I've been tellin' my dreams to the scarecrow 'Bout the places that I'd like to see I said, friend do you think I'll ever get there Ah, but he just stands there smilin' back at me So I confessed my sins to the preacher About the love I've been prayin' to find Is there a brown eyed boy in my future, yeah He says. girl you've got nothin' but time But how do you wait for heaven And who has that much time And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know, that you were born, you were born to fly My daddy, he's grounded like the oak tree My momma, she is steady as the sun Oh you know I love my folks But I keep starin' down the road Just lookin' for my one chance to run Yeah, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird I will blow in the wind like a seed I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free Oh, how do you wait for heaven And who has that much time And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know, that you were born You were born yeah You were born to fly So how do you wait for heaven And who has that much time And how do you keep your feet on the ground When you know that you were born You were born to fly fly fly fly Hey Ooooh, ooooh (Born to Fly- Sarah Evans) When I finished singing I looked up and I was surprised to see that I had gathered a fairly large crowed and they were cheering loudly, when I looked over at Sam my heart almost skipped a beat when I saw his eyes soften and he looked at me with such longing it matched mine perfectly. As I made my way off of the stage Sam gently took my hand and he lead me back to the booth we were sharing, John brought over my favorite drink for me; when I looked at the clock I saw that it was already past midnight "That was beautiful Akiko, when did you begin writing it" Sam asked as he drank his last beer, I looked down sadly "I began writing it about a week ago; I decided it was time for me to move on after what my dick head ex-boyfriend did to me" "Can you tell me what happened" he asked as he reached over and took my hand in his to comfort me "I meet him while I was in college; I worked part time in a restaurant near the collage and he was a regular of mine, he would always sit at the counter and talk to me whenever it wasn't too busy. After a few months we decided to date but after being together for a couple of years he began to change, he would come to the restaurant and would cause a scene whenever I had to sever a male costumer, my boss got so mad that he fired me; at first I was ok with it, I had more time to study and stuff" I paused for a moment to collect myself and I took a sip of my drink before I continued "One day while I was in class I began working on a new song and I got so excited that I decided to go home early so I could test it out but when I walked into the house I heard a strange noise coming from upstairs, so I put my stuff down and went to investigate the noise; I found out the sound was coming from my room, when I looked through the crack I saw that my boyfriend and my mother were having sex on my bed; that was over 9 years ago" tears began to fall from my eyes and Sam grabbed a napkin from the table and he gently wiped away my tears. "It's ok Akiko you don't have to say anymore" he said as he got up, at first I thought he was going to leave me instead he slid in the booth beside me and he wrapped his arm around my waist; I felt my heart begin to speed up then he gently pulled me close so that my head was now laying on his shoulder and I began crying again. For the next 15 minutes he did nothing but hold me close as I cried against his shoulder, once I was finished I gently pushed away and when I saw the mess I made of his shirt I gasped as fresh tears began to form in my eyes "Oh my god Sam, I'm so sorry" I said as I reached over and I grabbed some napkins off the table, I tried to dry up his shirt as best as I could but he just grabbed my hands and laid them flat against his chest "Akiko honey chill ok it's just a shirt, it's nothing for you get all worked up over" I nodded and I began to calm down, he smiled as he slowly released me; we stared at each other for what seemed like forever until John yelled for me " Akiko, honey we need some help over here" I nodded and yelled that I was coming just as Sam slid out of the booth so I could get out, once I was standing in front of him I noticed that I only came up to his chest so I stood up on my tippy toes and I kissed him on his cheek "Thanks for listening Sam, you're the first person I've ever told about Michael and my mother" he nodded as he reached up and stroke my cheek gently "I'm glad you trusted me enough with your secret and I promise to take it to the grave with me" he said as he brought my hand up to his mouth and he kissed it again. As I went back to work Sam decided to sit at the bar so we could continue talking whenever we got a chance; at first it kind of reminded me of Michael but this time it felt completely different, this time it felt more natural. Everything was going great until our boss James Hunter walked up to the stage and announced that since hardly anyone wanted to sing he called me up to the stage to get people fired up, I sighed as I made my way up the stage once again and I began singing a song that one of my band mates wrote a while back: This ain't a song for the brokenhearted No silent prayer for the faith departed And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud It's my life It's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" I just wanna live while I'm alive 'Cause it's my life This is for the ones who stood their ground For Tommy and Gina who never backed down Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake Luck ain't even lucky, gotta make your own breaks It's my life And it's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" I just wanna live while I'm alive 'Cause it's my life You better stand tall When they're calling you out Don't bend, don't break Baby, don't back down It's my life It's now or never 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said, "I did it my way" I just wanna live while I'm alive (It's my life) And it's now or never
