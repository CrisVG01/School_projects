My name is Nostariel (Nost-are-ee-ell) I am the daughter of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn of Lothlorien, I was born 192 of the Third Age which makes me 2827. I am out with my patrol party, protecting the lands of Lothlorien from urakhai of Saurman's "my lady we should search for Halidir and his men" one of my men said but I was deep in conversation with my brother in law Elrond "The fellowship should be in your lands now" Elrond said "Very well I will look for them and take them to my mother Elrond, I will protect them" I said "My lady?" "Sorry Talfagoron. I was talking with Elrond. I heard we must find the fellowship in these woods" I said they all nodded and we began our search for the fellowship. I was walking far ahead and heard: "Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox." The fellowship stopped as the Elvin soldiers of Lothlorien surrounded the group, bows pointed at all of them "bring them to me Nostariel" my mother said "yes mother I will" "The Dwarf breaths so loud, we could have shot him in the dark Halidir said. "Haldir o Lrien. (Haldir of Lorien) Henion anron, boe ammen I dulu ln. Boe ammen veriad ln. (We come here for help. We need your protection)" The ranger said "Aragorn, these woods are perilous. We should go back." The dwarf said "And go where?" I asked them Halidir bowed to me and said: "My Lady Nostariel I will have them removed for they bring great evil" " I know what it is they bring with them, they are welcomed here, and I will not turn them away, for it is our protection they seek. You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back. Come. She is waiting." I said Myself and Halidir led them into the woods. You noticed that the Elves still had their arrows pointed at the group. "Lower your weapons, they are our guests and undermine and my mother's protection" I said they all nodded and lowered their weapons **welcome Frodo of the shire, I am Lady Nostariel** I told Frodo in his head he looked at me and smiled meekly **do not be afraid Frodo, I understand the great weight on your shoulders better than you think for I am to be a ring bearer soon as my mother is** "My Lady thank you for your aid" The man said "your welcome, I'm afraid I do not know all of your names" I said "I am Aragorn, this legolas of the woodland realm, Gimli son of Gloin, Bormoir of Gondor, Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo of the Shire" Aragorn said "So you are the one my niece loves?" I said "my lady I do not understand?" Aragorn said "This Lady Nostariel, the daughter of Lady Galadriel and Lord Celeborn" Halidir said I nodded in thanks. Aragorn and Legolas were shocked for they had never heard of me. "Welcome to Lothlorien home the Lady and Lord of the woods" Halidir said "if you will excuse, Halidir my mother wishes to see them right away" I said He nodded as did the fellowship and soldiers I went off to my room and got changed into my gown and headed the where my parents were meeting the fellowship. When the fellowship entered I was just coming down the stairs and stood behind my mother and father off to the right of them. "Nine there are here, but ten there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak to him." My father said My mother spoke after looking at Aragorn and said: "He has fallen into shadow. The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true." She looked directly at Sam she spoke and cont'd saying "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for your are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight, you will sleep in peace." The fellowship all bowed as they left I had a vision of myself fighting with Aragorn and Gimli at Helm's Deep then another at Mins Tirith "Mother . . " "Yes I saw it also you may" was all my mother said and my father nodded in agreement. She must have shared the vision with them After I had the vision I began my slow descent down the winding staircases Lothlorien down towards my favourite spot in all of Lothlorien to silverlode. I have travelled and fought in many places in Middle Earth but Lothlorien will always be my home. ~~~~~~~~ other POV ~~~~~~~ "I believe she is an elven witch like Galadriel" Gimli said plainly "Gimli, she saved your life for being killed by Halidir for what you said" Aragorn said "I like her, she's very pretty" Merry said "Yes I must agree" Pippin said "Frodo what do you think?" Pippin said "She's very kind, she spoke to me in my head as we were entering the woods, the same way her mother did" Frodo said "I'm going for a walk" Legolas said "is he alright?" Merry asked "let the pointy eared elven prince go" Gimli said "I wonder why she was wearing a armour earlier?" Bormoir asked out loud "I would say by the armour she was wearing she is a commander of the Elven armies of Lothlorien and Rivendell" Aragorn said "You would be correct my Lord she is my commander when she is here in Lothlorien. Her father trained her to be a commander." Halidir said "Has she even led you to war?" Bormoir asked "Yes she has, she has never led the army astray" Halidir said "really I would like to see her fight sometime against me" Bormoir said doubting the Lady's ability "That can be arranged, but I must warn you she could kill before you could draw your sword" Halidir said ~~~~~~~ Nostariel POV ~~~~~~ I continued on my walk a heard someone walking behind me I turned and saw Legolas coming towards me I smiled at him "good evening my Lady" he said in a bow "Please call me Nostariel, I quite dislike the formalities as I am sure you do" I said with a smile "you are right I do" he said "you really like Lothlorien?" he asked I giggled a bit and answered "yes I do. As you enter the woods, the golden leaves of the Mallorn trees rustle softly. The peace and healing of Lothlorien makes your heart lighter, your weariness falling away with each step you take. The air here is sweet with the fragrance of flowers, every breath is a joy. The deeper you walk, the more enchanting the scene, till finally you gaze, amazed at Caras Galadhon, the City of Trees. Lights flicker among the branches, calling your spirit onward and upward." I said "I understand completely. The fellowship is in your debt" He said "I am only doing what is right Legolas. For you all are risking your lives for myself and all of middle earth, the least I can do is grant you a couple nights of peace. Long time ago when I fought for the first time in war a man told my he was in my debt for saving his life, I asked for nothing but for him to live a fulfilled life and once again that is all I ask for all of you" I said to him "Thank you. Nostariel I must ask why were you wearing armour when we first met?" he asked "I was patrolling the borders of Lothlorien with my patrol group, for it is my duty as the Commander of the Lothlorien and Rivendell armies, as it was once my father's job" I said "Nostariel how long have you been the commander?" he asked "for as long as I can remember" I said "my Lady Nostariel you have challenger" Halidir said "Halidir how many times must I tell just call me Nostariel. And who is the challenger?" I asked "Bormoir of Gondor. He wishes to see how well you fight" Halidir said "I see well I shall get changed then and meet them at the training grounds" I said "Yes my La . .Nostariel" Halidir said "now was that so hard to say?" I asked he just shook his head saying no and turned to leave "Would you like me to escort you to your room?" Legolas asked "Very well I'll telly you how to get there" I said he just smiled at me and we left on our way. As Legolas and I headed away from Silverlode off towards my bedroom in the heart of the city of trees. We walked in silence until one of my patrols arrived and said "My Lady a patrol of Urakhai are heading this way" he said "Yes I will be there in a moment, tell Halidir to gather 50 of our strongest men" I said he just nodded and left to get Halidir "I'm sorry Legolas please excuse me" I said "quite alright Nostariel" he said with a smile I ran off pulling up my dresses skirt to run better. I arrived in my room and put on usual garb and grabbed all of my weapons I ran past the fellowship in a hurry to meet up with Halidir and our men. "My Lady we would like to help you" Aragorn called "Very well but hurry up" I yelled back Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Bormoir followed me. The Hobbits were taken to my parents for their protection. **Halidir where are you** I called to him in my head **On our western borders Nostariel** he told me back "Quickly they well be here at any moment" I said and began to run faster Bormoir, Aragorn and Legolas kept up easily but Gimli was slightly behind us so I encouraged him "Gimli the fast you run the quicker you will get to kill the Urakhai" I said which made him run faster I laughed at this When I saw Halidir in view, he had more men then I asked for, then I read his mind and he told me mother saw we would need more and sent more. I just nodded to him Note: instead of 50 men about 200 of them "Why are they here?" he asked "They offered me there aid and I took it" I said I walked to the front of the line and every stood straight I began I speech to encourage them (spoke in common tongue) "Fighters of Lorien, oaths you have taken, now is our time to fulfill them. We will defeat this evil and send it back to from whence it came. Show them no mercy, for you shall receive none! It is honor for me to fight by all of you once again." I finished and bowed to all of them They all saluted me "Patrol 1, 2, and 3 to the trees shoot them down as they approach the rest of you we will take them out here on the ground" I said "Their armour is weak at the neck and beneath the arm" Legolas said and every one nodded I walked out of the forest with Halidir by my side to meet the Urakhai troop leader **every one have you arrows ready to shoot, in case this discussion goes wrong** I told every one in their heads "Commander of Saruman why to you come to the Lands of Lorien?" I asked "You are hiding a hobbit which carries something of my lords" he said All I could smell off him was death and decay "We hide nothing in these woods, for if it came anywhere near us I would not protect it for it
