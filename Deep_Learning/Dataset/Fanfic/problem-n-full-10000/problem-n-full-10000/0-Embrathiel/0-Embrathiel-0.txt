Glory in the Light of Hope By: Embrathiel **GITLOH** Disclaimer: If you haven't figured it out yet, I don't own Harry Potter. Probably because I didn't write it. A/N: Um, what can I say? Another plot bunny? **GITLOH** Chapter 1: Best of Intentions **GITLOH** Dearest Hermione: Many things have come clear to me in the last few days and it seems as though a veil has been lifted from both my thoughts and emotions. You Hermione, are the center of that change, but you are also the piece I must address last of all in this letter so that my errors may be clear to you. That sounds aweful to me, but I believe that only you would truly appreciate the sheer number of crumpled pieces of parchment that are currently hiding the floor from my view as I attempt to put in to words what I should have long ago. I am terrible with words and i am sure that no matter how much I think or change, that will remain the same. I am not sure how well or ill you are, but if someone is reading this to you, then I ask that they please read this in its entirety as while there are important bits that some may consider secrets, I do not consider them so. Its time to stop hiding from the realities we live with. When I got back to the castle after the Ministry incident, Dumbledore told me about a prophecy that was made before I was born. Yeah its the one we tried to keep from Tom the tosser. Well, as it happens he heard a bit because some git told it to him. Apparently, if it is to be believed, I am the only one who can defeat his red-eyed spookiness because he tried to do me in, as a result of hearing the prophecy in the first place. Sounds like a bunch of self-fulfilling shite to me. Merlin I need to drop Divination. The short version is that now that he marked me, I am the only one who can beat him up well enough to send him from this world and in the end it will come to a fight between him and myself. Please don't cry Hermione, I already did my share, and have since decided that while I will do everything I can to stop him, I don't put much stock in prophecies and won't live my life by it. See, I'm thinking about things, isn't it great? Next comes my childhood. After mum and dad died for me, chief whiskers, in his all encompassing senility, decided it was a good idea to send me to live with my relatives and put blood wards, yes, illegal freaking blood wards, over the house to keep me safe. From death eaters, not the Dursleys. They did a lot; we can talk about that later I don't feel like writing about it. I am guessing that if anyone is reading this to you its Madam Pomfrey, in which case, she knows the damage and could tell you if she likes, you have my permission ma'am. I didn't exactly learn much about love from them. I was raised to think that you got beat for everything and that that was what love was. I met you and Ron, and you were my first friends in the whole world. As a result, I treated you terribly Hermione. My only defense is that I had no clue how to treat a friend because I was still learning what a friend was in the first place. The next example of a family I had was the Weasleys where I was stuffed full of food and worshiped like some kind of child hero by Ginny. Well, getting beaten for breathing, and being stuffed full of food by someone who for some reason thinks she is your mother, aren't very good examples of what love is. You, being you Hermione, have already likely figured out where I am going with this, but here me out. Sirius was next. I can't even express how happy I was when he asked if I would want to live with him over the summer; and how crushed I was when that opportunity was taken away from me by chief beardy. He tried to love me, I am sure of it, and I know he did, but he was just out of prison with the man hunt still active, while also being imprisoned in his own house. Sirius died for me Hermione. He died in the Department of Mysteries. He came to help us and he died for it. He died fighting and I never got to tell him how much he meant to me. I'm still not ok with it and I shouldn't expect I will be for some time. It did however teach me something. If you love someone you want them to be healthy, you would die or live for them. If you love someone, you suffer through hell to be there for them. Hermione, I have had terrible examples in the past but I believe I have realized something about myself that I wouldn't have realized otherwise. I hate that you were hurt in the DOM. Its killing me to know you are likely in pain. I would do anything to help you get better. You have always been there with me, regardless of how much of a git I was. I fought off Tom at the ministry that night. He tried to possess me but I banished him because I realized that I had hope and people I care about. It took a while to realize it but when I got rid of him, I think I got rid of other things as well. Luna said something about it but I can't write what she said because I honestly don't know how to spell all those things. The general idea was though that it got rid of a bunch of compulsion charms and modifying spells. Apparently it also got rid of the curse in my scar, whatever it was. Did you ever wonder why I never really changed much after first year? I think Quirrel with Tommy as a hat, put some spells on my to keep me about the same level. In just a couple days my magic has grown, not a terrible amount, but a fair bit. I feel, well, smarter and a lot less lazy. Hence the actual effort in this. What it comes down to though, is that I, I love you Hermione. I, I don't know what else to say because I don't know how to describe or explain it, but i do. You've always been here, even more than Ron. You support me and help me. You fight with me rather than behind me. You don't treat me any differently than a normal person and for all those things I am grateful. You likely don't see it, but you are beautiful Hermione. sod Ron for not noticing you are a girl. I noticed, I just, didn't know what to do about it. Maybe you didn't either, but if you wanted to, maybe we could talk about it? I do also understand that you may be feeling exactly the opposite, so I will understand if you don't want to talk. I understand if you hate me for dragging everyone to London and getting everyone hurt. Especially you. I came by a couple times to visit you, but you were asleep and I don't want to bother you. I am sorry for everything and hope you can forgive me. I love you. Harry **GITLOH** Madam Pomfrey finished reading and when she looked up from the parchment, Hermione saw that the woman was crying as well. As she had been placed in a paralytic state in order for her organs to heal properly, Hermione could not move anything but her head. Tears were streaming down her cheeks and she couldn't wipe them. Her heart was breaking and it hurt more than the after affects of whatever blasted curse she had been hit with. As if understanding her plight, the matron flicked her wand and the exess tears disappeared. She still wept, but they no longer overwhelmed her eyes. "Ma'am, please, I need to talk to him. I can't leave him like that." she gasped out. The older woman dabbed at her own eyes and stood. "Of course dear, I'll send for him now." Hermione stopped, she had opened her mouth, entirely prepared to beg, but... "Ma'am?" "Unlike most of the staff here, I have not forgotten what it means to find reciprocatory love, even at your age." she smiled and raised her wand. "Expecto Patronum! Harry Potter, it appears I have one more thing I need to examine you for, come by the hospital wing as soon as you possibly can." Her winged serpent patronus sprang away and the matron moved off to her office. God, could Harry actually love her? He was a boy so of course he hadn't noticed, but she had hoped. She thought it was totally obvious, why else would she be friends with Ron, not for his charm clearly. She put up with the cruelty for Harry, Harry who even when influenced by Ron still tried to do the right thing. What else had happened in London? She had only awoken after Neville, Ginny, and Luna had left the hospital wing, Ron having been sent to St Mungo's. Madam Pomfrey had told her that the others were all well however so she need not worry. Upon waking and discovering the letter from Harry, she had demanded that the woman read it to her, either that or she would expect that she be allowed visitors so someone could do it for her. Apparently preferring to suffer embarrassment herself from the potential contents of the letter rather than allow visitors inside, Madame Pomfrey had grudgingly sat down and begun to read. Would he come soon? Was he in class? Had he been prepared to talk to her when he wrote the letter? Of course not, that's why he put it in a bloody letter after all. Knowing Harry he was likely still terrified of encountering her and was hoping she would still be asleep when he arrived. Without realizing it, Hermione realized that she must have dozed off as the next thing she knew she was roused by a bell ringing in the office at the end of the ward. The doors were out of her view but she watched Madame Pomfrey hurry over to them and begin to address someone. "Mr. Potter, good, now get over to this bed, I need to check you out right away." The curtains were drawn between the bed next to her's and her own, but she heard Harry sit down on it and the soft flicks of a wand. "Ah, as I thought, your magic levels are all twisted up. Here take this, you will be right as rain in just a moment." Hermione suppressed a giggle when Harry gagged. "Oh dear, take this, quickly. I appologize Mr. Potter, I must be getting old if I am mistaking vials like that. Yes, I'm sure your pupils will, eh, grow back very soon, you just won't be able to see until then. Just rest here until you recover. You have my apologies." With that, the woman walked off, giving her wand a casual flick, sending the dividing curtains rocketing back against the wall, revealing Harry laying on the nearby bed, eyes entirely green in the center. The poor thing looked terribly confused, well, she could fix that. "Harry." He jumped and looked even more fearful if that was possible. "Oh, erm, hi Hermione. How are you feeling?" he asked. Grinning at his expression she said, "Awful, some git sent me a letter, forgetting that I could hardly be mad at him for something so
