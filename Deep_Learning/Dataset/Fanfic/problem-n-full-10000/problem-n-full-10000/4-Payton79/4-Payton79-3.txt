So, here I give you my Meet the Mate Contest entry, Tie the Knot . Enjoy! See you at the bottom. Disclaimer: I don't own Twilight or Married at First Sight … ******TtK****** Tie the Knot ~Edward~ "Edward, how are you? This is Dr. Carlisle Cullen speaking." A friendly voice greeted me upon picking up my cellphone in the middle of work hours. Dr. Cullen … Dr. Cullen? Oh right. He was the psychologist from that joke of a reality TV show / "sociological experiment" I met a few weeks ago. Having lost a bet, my friends had made me go to a casting for a new dating show which was supposed to be filmed here in New York City. As it turned out, the show wasn't going to be much about dating but something that could be called a "blind wedding." The idea was four experts would do interviews with potential candidates and try to find matches; people who somehow fit together but would see each other for the first time at their own wedding. Of course, I turned tail and ran. I was twenty-eight years old and definitely not going to get married anytime soon — if ever — all the more, not to a stranger who might turn out to look like Frankenstein's Bride but liked the same books and bands as me, and shared my favorite color. Those people were nuts, and everyone who agreed to go along with it was even crazier. When I returned home and told my roommate, Emmett, and our friend, Seth, about the asinine concept of that show, they burst out laughing. Em even spat the beer he'd just sipped across our coffee table. After a minute or two, they calmed down somewhat, and I was sure the whole thing was off the table — until they started making fun of me for not being marriage material in the first place. They riled me up until I bet I'd get cast if I set my mind to it. Em was so sure he'd win that he promised to hand his beloved black Mustang over to me if the show wanted me. Seth, not one to stand back, bet his new flat screen TV. We quarreled back and forth about my wager. First, they wanted me to get another tat of their choice, then decided they rather preferred I go on a date with the pimply girl living in the apartment below us. But when I raked my hand though my errant hair in exasperation, Em jumped up from the couch, daring me to shave my head if I lost and go bald for a month. They both knew I was kind of obsessed with my unruly, always-looking-freshly-fucked mop of weirdly-colored hair; and that made it the perfect incentive — besides Emmett's precious Mustang, of course. So I'd decided to go through with the casting process, have endless talks with the "experts" as the producers called them: a couples' therapist, a spiritual adviser, a sexologist — whatever the hell that was supposed to mean — and a psychologist. "Are you still there, Edward?" Said psychologist's voice pulled me back when he noticed I'd apparently zoned out on him. I shook my head to get back into the game. "Yeah, sure. I'm just surprised to hear from you." After all, two months had passed since the last interview. Of course, with my hair at stake, I'd done everything I could to make them believe I wanted nothing more than for them to find me the perfect wife, lying through my teeth at times, but, to be honest, I hadn't thought they'd actually choose me. Maybe they hadn't, and he merely called to let me down easily. After all, they had to think me desperate to find a bride. "Well, it took us some time to work through all the material we gathered, but we came to the conclusion that we found the perfect match for you. Would you be free later this afternoon to come to my office and talk to me?" Dammit! I'd actually done it. Em, I hope you enjoy the last hours with your 'Stang because, tonight, that baby's going t o be MIN E! "Are you still with me, Edward?" Carlisle asked; a little worried. Am I? Huh. What was I going to say? Should I meet with him? Of course, I wouldn't actually go through with that stupid show. Marrying a stranger just because the experts considered her perfect for me and statistics proved that arranged marriages lasted longer. To be honest, I wanted to laugh in his face and ask him if he'd lost his marbles. He was a nice guy, though, and I didn't want to be an ass. But what would I say to him? I'm not interested anymore? Thanks but no thanks? I don't need your help anymore because I found a bride on my own? Maybe this would be easier done in person. "Of course, Carlisle. When and where?" ****TtK**** At five o'clock sharp I stepped into what had to be Dr. Cullen's office at NYU. There, on the couch, sat the blond man in his mid-forties I already knew from our earlier talk, but next to him was an unfamiliar guy, roughly the same age, with dark hair that was a few inches shorter. That one I'd never met before. "Edward, great to see you again. This is Demetri Ivanov from the production company. He's here to talk the contract and other legal arrangements through with you. Demetri, this is Edward Masen, one of our lucky grooms-to-be." I shook both men's hands and sat down. Before I could tell them I wasn't going to be in their show, though, Mr. Ivanov pulled a contract out of his briefcase and placed it in front of me. To organize my thoughts, I started to leaf through it quickly, halting my motions when, in the middle of the last page, the number $50,000 caught my eye. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that money wasn't supposed to be a fine for breach of contract, which I first thought, but a financial compensation for time I'd have to make for the filming of the show. Fuck! That's a lot of money — and almost exactly the amount we'd need to launch the video game Em, Seth and I developed. We'd worked on our project for three years, and it was in the finishing stages now. We'd run from pillar to post to try to find someone willing to finance the whole endeavor, seeing we'd gain so much more than the relatively low investment. Banks weren't very forthcoming with loans for projects like that nowadays, though. And none of us had the funds to get it done on our own. Dammit! Could I go through with this whole charade to make our dream come true? ****TtK**** After two hours of information about the details of the show and everything I'd be expected to do, they'd let me go with forty-eight hours for consideration. "Em, your 'Stang is mine," I greeted darkly when I entered our shared apartment. "You're shitting me!" A shocked-looking Emmett screamed as he peeked out of his room. I raised my hand that was holding the papers, waving them in his face. "No, and I have the contract to prove it. Call Seth. He needs to come over ASAP. We gotta talk." ****TtK**** "Wait," Seth stopped me in my explanations. "They're expecting you to actually marry someone you not only haven't met but don't even know her name? That's even crazier than it sounded when you first told us about the whole thing." "Yes. If I agree to go along with it, I'll have to buy a tux, invite friends and family and meet my bride at the altar. We'll have a reception, spend the night at a hotel, then go on a honeymoon — all expenses paid. After we return, we'll have to move in together and live like the usual married couple — whatever the fuck that means." I probably zoned out on that part. "Anyway, after six weeks, we have to decide if we want to stay married or file for divorce. Four to twelve weeks later, I'll be happily single again and fifty grand richer." Emmett wrinkled his forehead in thought. "What about prior money and stuff?" The guys from the production company had it all covered. "There will be a prenup, taking care neither of us has any rights to the other's possessions." "And your friends and family have to play along?" Seth asked with a raised brow. "No, they don't. But since the TV people seem to think they can actually found lasting relationships, they, of course, think I'd want the people close to me around for my nuptials." There was no doubt I didn't want that, but I knew I had to play along for six weeks. Em took a sip from his beer. "We'll be on TV, then?" "If you agree to help, then yes," I stated, matter-of-fact. "Man, if you're willing to do that to get us the money, then there's no question. We have to make it as easy on you as possible." Seth looked at me with as much conviction as he could muster. "Well, seems like our Ed is getting married." Emmett tried to work up some enthusiasm. "Does that mean we'll be having a bachelor party?" I snorted. "That's not part of the show, but I don't see why not." Who wouldn't want to see a hot-as-fuck chick strip and give you a lap dance? "Is sex part of the show?" All of a sudden, Seth seemed to get excited. I ran my hand through my hair in contemplation. "They want it to be a real marriage. So, if my bride's hot, I wouldn't say no." And like that, the decision was made. I was getting married in four weeks. ****TtK**** "Well, now that you've signed the contract, we'll go through a few things again," Demetri said, taking the papers from me. "The prenuptial agreement will be ready for you next week. You can take it to a lawyer of your choice, if you want, but I assure you, it's bulletproof. Since we will handle the divorce as well, if need be, we're careful to make that as simple as possible on all ends." Thank God for small favors! "Here's a list of numbers and addresses for you. The first is the number of a doctor we work with. You're supposed to call him to get a full check-up. We wouldn't want to cause you any lasting damage. And of course, we have to make sure you're not carrying any communicable diseases." He threw me a wink before he looked down to his schedule sheet again. "Okay. Next address is for a place to buy your tux. It'll be charged to the company's account. Then there's a jeweler on there. Of course, you'll want to get your bride a ring, charged on the company account as well." Of course I would — not. But it seemed as though I didn't have much of a choice. Nodding agreeably, I let him continue with his list. "You know, we taped your sessions with our experts during the casting,
