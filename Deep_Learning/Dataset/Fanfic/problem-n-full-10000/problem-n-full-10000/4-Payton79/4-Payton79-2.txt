A/N: Hi and welcome to the first chapter of my new story. When Two Blue Line was almost completely written, I was desperately looking for inspiration for a next project when the show Married At First Sight started to air on a German TV station. That was exactly what I'd been waiting for. Some may know the show, others won't. I assure you, it's not necessary to have seen it to get what this story is about. For all of you who didn't know, I wrote an OS as an extended teaser for this story and entered it into the Meet the Mate Contest . Those of you who either followed the contest or read the OS after I posted it, you may remember parts of the first two chapters, but I promise, this story is starting a few weeks before the OS, and all parts that were in the OS have at least been extended. I gathered a wonderful team around me; three wonderful ladies I just couldn't do without. evelyn-shaye , Midnight Cougar and LaPumuckl , I can't tell you how much I admire your work and appreciate the time and effort you put into this. Thank you all so much. Now, let's see if you like my new story :). Disclaimer: I neither own Twilight nor Married At First Sight … ******TtK****** Chapter 1 – Debts of Honor ~Edward~ Why was I up at ten in the fucking morning on a goddamn Saturday, sitting in a conference room with about three hundred other guys, waiting for something — anything — to happen? Oh yeah, right — because I was a sucker for punishment. Not able to keep my fucking mouth shut, I bet against my friends, Seth and Emmett, that a taxi would get through rush hour traffic faster than Em's beloved black Mustang. That idiot was so confident in his baby's power and his own driving prowess that I just had to take him down a notch. Unfortunately, I must have ended up with the dumbest cabby in Manhattan to take me across town for that race. A few fries short of a Happy Meal, the idiot managed to lose his way twice in the process. That gave Emmett the chance to arrive with time to spare; he'd even parked the car properly behind the bar where we were supposed to meet. Being sure of myself and New York's taxi drivers, I would have accepted any wager, so I could maybe thank my lucky stars I only had to go to the casting for this mysterious new dating show. If I won, I'd become the new Bachelor or that guy who pretends to be a millionaire only to have the unlucky winner find out later I was about as poor as a church mouse. Okay, that might be a little exaggerated, but I was far from being wealthy. I was twenty-eight, rotting away in the IT department of a big company and living with my college roommate. I wasn't looking too bad — at least the ladies never complained — but I wasn't anywhere near Prince Charming material. How long were they planning on keeping us waiting? The email Emmett received, after signing me up for this joke, said the thing would start at ten. Now it was five past ten. I wasn't usually the first to arrive anywhere, but couldn't we at least expect them to respect us enough to start on time? Come on, we got up virtually in the middle of the night on a Saturday for this big event. Five more minutes passed before four people walked onto the podium situated in the front of the room. The two men and two women took seats facing us and exchanged a few words we couldn't catch. Then a blond guy in his mid-forties stood, picked up a microphone and stepped in front of the table. "Good morning, gentlemen. My name's Dr. Carlisle Cullen and I'm a psychologist at New York University. My companions here are Dr. Esme Platt …" He gestured toward an attractive, hazel-haired woman of about forty. "She's a sociology professor at NYU." The woman nodded in greeting, and Dr. Cullen waved his hand toward a pretty blonde of maybe thirty-five. "This is Irina Denali. She's a sexologist." She smiled encouragingly. "And last but not least, we have Peter Nichols. He's a spiritual advisor at Columbia University." The slender, dark-haired man on the right end of the table gave one quick nod. "Now that introductions are out of the way, you might ask yourself what a bunch of shrinks and university graduates are doing at a casting for a TV show. Let me tell you, this is not your regular dating show. It's a radical, new, sociological experiment." He let his words sink in for a moment, none of us having any idea what he was rambling about. "Decades of studies on marriages and divorces have proven that — statistically — arranged marriages have a better chance at lasting than ones founded through the traditional dating system." Why was he talking about marriage? Wasn't this The Dating Game or something? "All of you have answered an ad targeted toward people who want to settle down and find a lasting relationship." Hell no! I hadn't even seen that ad. Emmett had planned this whole thing. "We have established a system which allows us to match up people with accuracy and precision. Our goal is to find partners whose characters, hobbies, future plans and values are similar enough to convince us they'll be able to forge a lasting bond. Those partners will be married at their first meeting …" I didn't really hear anything else after that. Married? Is that guy nuts? Are they all totally out of their fucking minds? I felt the overwhelming urge to jump up from my chair and run out of the room as fast as I could. Somehow, though, I remained seated and instead watched the guys around me — most of them wore matching expressions of shock and horror, but a few idiots looked actually intrigued. Having no idea how long the meeting lasted, I was relieved when I could leave without drawing too much attention to myself. I walked out of the room hidden in a crowd, grabbed papers the people at the doors handed each of us, and made a beeline for the next subway station to get home, where there was booze to drown the memory of this strange experience. ****TtK**** "Oh man, I had no idea." Emmett shook his head, taking a pull from his beer bottle after he'd spewed the last one across the coffee table in surprise. "I thought you were going to woo The Bachelorette or something. But, man, getting married on TV? That's sick!" "How are they planning to make those magic matches anyway?" Seth asked, incredulous. I chuckled humorlessly. "I don't have the faintest idea. I zoned out right after the word 'married.' If you're interested, they handed me these papers." I motioned to the stack of crumbled sheets I'd unceremoniously dropped onto the couch next to me. Seth leaned over and picked them up, reading with curiosity. "You said one of the chicks was a sexologist? What the fuck's that supposed to mean? Did she look like a high-class hooker or something?" Emmett chortled. "If so, neither you nor I can afford her services. All of them were dressed in the finest clothes." Whatever it was they did for a living, they had to be making a shit load of money. Suddenly, Seth burst out laughing. "Oh, Ed, there's no way you'd have made it into that show, man. They want you to tell them where you see yourself in five years. I doubt they'll find a woman wanting to live here with you and Emmett while you spend most of your time drinking, having poker nights or playing video games. And here, how long was your longest relationship? I don't think six months will do." Emmett immediately joined in. "I'm sure they're asking if you're a cat or a dog person. You should tell them how you killed that kitten by force-feeding her sand. I'm sure that's going to leave a winning impression." He guffawed loudly. "Em, I was four back then, and I doubt that's a serious criteria." I tried to defend myself. "It is," Seth objected. "It's question twenty-five." Emmett had a hard time speaking through his bellowing laughter. "See, you can be glad the whole thing is so absolutely ridiculous we let you bail out. You didn't have the slightest chance of getting onto that show anyway." Getting married was the farthest thing from my mind, and the thought of going through tedious interviews and questionnaires raised my hackles. Though the way they painted me as incapable of convincing the TV people of my eligibility, rubbed me the wrong way. "If I set my mind to it, I could totally get into that show," I said with conviction, emptying my bottle. "Ed, you're as much marriage material as Seth's a girl. Even you can't put on that good of an act." Emmett lifted his beer only to find it empty. Instead, he rose from his seat and grabbed a bottle of Johnny Walker that was left from a party, together with three glasses and set them on the table. Shaking his head, Seth poured us all a generous amount. "I'm sorry, Edward, but I think Emmett's right. You don't stand a chance." Lifting my glass of amber liquid, I swirled the content around a bit, musing. "What if I do? Of course, I won't get married. I'm not insane. But what if they cast me? What's it worth to you?" Emmett scoffed. "I'm so sure you'll lose, you'll get my 'Stang if you actually make it." Knowing how much he loved that car, I could see how confident he was about the bet. "Seth, you in?" I asked. "Sure," he agreed. "I bet my new sixty inch flat screen that you won't make it into that show." Emmett knocked back his drink. "Now, we've covered the highly unlikely case that you win. What about the most probable scenario in which you don't? What's your wager?" "I don't think I own anything either of you have much use for," I replied with a sense of relief. "Oh, you sure don't," Emmett mused. "But I think you should bet something more … personal, anyway. How about a tattoo. We choose the design and placing — within certain reason, of course." Considering I already had three tats, I wasn't afraid of the thing itself. I wouldn't put it past them, though, that I'd end up with their names on my ass cheeks. I was just trying to determine how sure I was of myself when Seth came up with a different idea. "No, no, no, no, no! How about he has to go on a date with that chick from downstairs that has a crush on him? You know, the ugly one with the pimply face and greasy hair. And I'm not talking a movie here. Dinner, drinks and dancing — in public. Oh, and the girl deserves a goodnight kiss, of course." Em and Seth both cracked up laughing while I felt my bile rise. That girl was really gross. I wasn't the typical womanizer with one girl on each finger, but I had certain standards, and she definitely didn't meet any of them. Exasperated, I ran my fingers through my unruly hair, contemplating my ability to play nice with the price exhibit of every haunted house, when Emmett jumped up from the couch, pointing his outstretched index finger at me with glee. "That's it! He has to shave his head! Not only that, he has to go bald for a month if he doesn't get cast in that show! What do you say, Eddie Boy, do we have a deal?" Dammit! Unerringly, they
