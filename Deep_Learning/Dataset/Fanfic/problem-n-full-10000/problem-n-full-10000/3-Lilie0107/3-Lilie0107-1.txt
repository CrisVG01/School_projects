Hi Readers, I know I should update my other stories, but I am on vacation right now and just too lazy to update. The next updates will probably come in one to two weeks, if I am in a good mood, it will be earlier. Anyway, this is a sweat Percabeth Oneshot (my first one, so sorry for mistakes), which I hope you will like. I wrote it for Valentine´s Day. It will set after the HoO-series, but I haven´t read Blood of Olympus yet, so I made up an ending. Long Story short, they travelled to Greece, had an awesome battle, Pery defeated Gaea and then a few years later begins this short story. Percy is 24 in this and Annabeth 23 (Sometimes Annabeth is older than Percy, but I like it more the other way). Annabeth get offered to buil New Athens and Percy turned down immortality (again) and wished for Hestia and Hades´ thrones in the council. That should be it. Now on to the the Disclaimer: I don´t own PJO and HoO, all rights go sadly to Rick Riordan. Enough said, Happy Valentine´s Day and stay tuned! On to the Story now (finally ;) ) …...(\_/)….~~~~~++++...++++~~~~ …..(=´.´=)..~~~~+++++.+++++~~~~ …..(=)..(=)…~~~~~++++++++~~~~ .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+++++~~~ ...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~, Annabeth pov I was currently in my chamber in San Francisco, lying on my bed and listening to My heart will go on from the movie Titanic (AN\gotta love this song) . I always imagined myself to be in this movie and came every time to the same thought: I knew that I couldn´t, unlike Rose, leave Percy like that. I wouldn´t knew what I´d do in this situation if we both were just mortals. A small, sad smile crept its way across my face. Percy would probably do the same thing like Jack: save my live, no matter the cost. He, in fact did it multiple times, always putting my life and happiness over his own. I can´t tell in words how much I love him. If I look at it with a little distance, I can see why I fell for him. Not only because he is hot, he is- no doubts there, but this is definitively not the only reason. He is loyal to no end, meaning he would never betray me and always hold my back. Needless is to say that I would do the same for him. He also is caring, always worried for the wellbeing of others before his own. He isn´t stupid either, quite the opposite actually. He is smart, sometimes a little obvious, but less than when we first met. I remembered all these times we stuck together, all the countless moments he saved my live. He travelled all over the country on a quest to rescue Artemis. I knew that this wasn´t why he went though, it was me. He travelled there to free me. Of course I was too young and a little obvious to not notice his feelings, but when I kissed him at Mt. Helens, I knew I had feelings for him. At this time Luke´s place in my heart shrunk, Percy filling his place. In the final battle, when he looked at me, concern in his eyes, I knew finally what decision was the right one to make. Sure I had had a crush on Luke for a while, but these feelings for him were never as strong as these for a certain son of Poseidon. I finally realized this at Mount Olympus, sitting beside him over a dying Luke. I couldn´t admit at this moment, that I ever loved the son of Hermes, because I didn´t. I merely had a crush on him, nothing more. More got only one person, this being my Seaweedbrain. Then at the bottom of the canoe lake, we shared our first kiss as a couple. It was the most amazing feeling I ever had. I was so happy, finally being freed from war and death waiting at every corner, finding a little peace from all the stress. That is until Hera took him. I searched for him; day and night I looked in forests, cities, villages, practically everywhere I could imagine, not finding at least a single little hint to his location. At nights I couldn´t sleep; nightmares of him dying haunted me whenever I tried to get rest. The days weren´t easy either. I didn´t get any sleep at nights and was tired all day. I had had bags under my eyes and looked pale, my usually stormy grey eyes were dull and bloodshot. I looked miserable. That is until the hope came up, this being Jason Grace, that he was alive and somewhere save. As I finally found out about the Roman camp and Hera's plans, I was furious with her. I knew from Jason, that she must´ve stolen his memory. That was the reason for more worries. Had he forgotten me? Had he found a new girlfriend? Was he happy? All those questions didn´t make my time away from him easier. As Leo then finally finished building the Argo II, we had finally gotten hope back. I worked on this ship with Leo as often as I could, eager to see my Seaweedbrain again. As I finally, after eight long months saw him again, a purple toga and a tattoo on his arm, I couldn´t describe all the emotions that ran through my body. Happiness, Hope, but at the same time Worry, Anger and Sadness were all present the moment I ran into his arm. And as he kissed me, all these feelings left, and were replaced with one emotion, stronger than all others: Love. After the trip to Rome, we fell into Tartarus. He could´ve let me die, but he didn´t let go. He fell into Tartarus with me. For me, just to make sure that we wouldn´t be separated again. These days there were hell, literally. But nonetheless, we made it. Our love held even through hell and back. After then finally defeating Gaea, I was truly happy. I first wanted to build a city like New Rome in Camp Half-Blood, but when I finished it, I didn´t instantly buy a house and move there. I was proud of my work but there was something holding me back I had a little bit more to live in the mortal world. I talked to Percy and we agreed that the first few months we would live together in Camp, but then we would go to college to study something, Architecture in my case. I, being a daughter of Athena, got instantly a place at a university in San Francisco, this being the reason for moving in with my dad again. We never good along as good as we did now. The time of Percy´s absence brought us finally closer. Percy stayed in New York near his now pregnant mother. We IMed nearly every day, but the time difference didn´t make things easier. This was the reason I was alone on Valentine's Day. My parents (my dad and step-mother) were at a diner, the twins Mathew and Bobby watched by friends of Helen. I was sad that I couldn´t be together with my boyfriend, but as I offered to visit him, he shifted uncomfortably and shook his head. He said "I don´t think this would be a good idea. I already planned on visiting someone important and you being here would make things… let´s say complicated." Of course he said it in an apologetic tone, but I got the message. "I don´t want you to be here!" So I was a little sad and angry now. On the other side I couldn´t shout at him for not wanting me over. I just had to deal with it, somehow. So, this is the reason I ended up in my room at Valentine´s Day, alone and hearing the song from Titanic… Percy pov Right now, I was leaving the airport in San Francisco. A few days ago Annabeth, my amazing girlfriend had IMed and asked, if she could visit me in New York for Valentine´s Day. It broke my heart as I said no, but I had already plans. I was going to surprise her. I had asked for an audience with Zeus and asked for his approval that I travel with a plane, at least this once. I had it all planned out (Yes, I am smart enough to plan something, deal with it!). I asked Athena for a quest to prove myself worthy before that, let´s say it wasn´t easy, and after a looong and very hard adventure, some fighting with Ladon, Scylla and Charybdis, I finally got her to agree with my plans. I then went to Aphrodite, asking for a favor she owed me and she gave me something special, along with her blessing, but for the ladder I didn´t really care. That got me where I am now, sitting in a taxi to the Chase residence. My girlfriend had explained to me that her parents wouldn´t be there today as well as her little half-brothers, giving me enough space to hang out with her and making a (hopefully) good surprise. I was slowly getting nervous, shifting in my seat and fiddling (An\ is that the right word?) with my fingers. I don´t know why I was this concerned, she already agreed to this, even if she had it forgotten by now, but she could´ve changed her mind and- "Hey, we are here. Don´t get driven away, princess!" The driver said. I paid him the money and got out of the care, but not before giving him one of my deluxe- I will-torture-you-so-that-you-wish-you-were-only-in-Tartarus-stare and saw him shiver, giving me a feeling of satisfaction. The moment I closed the door, he sped away, as if he couldn´t get away fast enough. I merely rolled my eyes at this and chuckled lightly, before instantly changing my mood to very happy. I was going to see my Wisegirl again. Yay! Annabeth pov I laid on my bed, now listening to one of my newer songs as the doorbell rang. I was instantly on alert. I hadn´t invited anyone and my parents sure as heck weren´t home this early. So, there is either a monster or a postman out there. I grabbed my dagger, just to be sure and walked to the door. I slowly unlocked it and as I opened it, I nearly had a heart attack. I was sure that I had to be dreaming, because in front of me stood none other than the love of my live, Perseus (Percy) Achilles Jackson, Savior of Olympus, Bane of Gaea, Kronos and some other cool (or not so cool) shit. My heart skipped a beat and I forgot o breath. There were no thoughts inside my head for once and all the stress and worries from the past few weeks of studying just vanished. Nothing mattered but the sea green orbs that bore into my grey ones, looking directly into my soul. I could clearly see the love and happiness in his eyes, the emotions I missed so dearly these past few months. I could only do one thing. I threw myself at him and hugged him, not caring if I let loose a few tears of joy. No one could describe how happy I was for having my other half back. As we broke the hug, I kissed him, a sweat and gently kiss, yet full of emotions like love and affection. I could feel the butterflies in my stomach and my head got light. After a few moments we broke the kiss, my forehead resting against his, both breathing heavily. Only when I looked down did I notice the blue flowers, lilies to be precise, that were laying very good protected in his arms along with the little red, heartshaped pillow. He noticed my look and chuckled softly. "Happy Valentine´s Day, Wisegirl" He said softly making me shiver as his breath bristled against
