Of toddlers and porridge The blond warrior grinned smugly as he moved his white horse forward and sideways. "You did not think you could slip past that, did you?" he challenged his dark-haired opponent. Erestor bit the inside of his lip to hide his glee as he slowly hovered his hand above the chess board, savouring the moment before making his master move. The former captain of King Turgon's army, now Chief of Defenses of Rivendell, the one who was widely known to be a brilliant strategist, had taken the bait. "Check," he mouthed triumphantly as he replaced Glorfindel's white tower with his own black queen. The eyes of the Golden One slowly widened as he assessed the new situation on the board. "Will you not make your next move?" the Seneschal asked sweetly. Glorfindel furrowed his brow as he once again considered his possible moves. Oh yes, he could get his king out of the danger zone. But then he would first lose his knight and then… A broad smile appeared on the blond warrior's face as he tipped over his king. "You win," he acknowledged with a dip of his head. "And you shall wash Caradhras when next it is needed," Erestor quipped happily. The large ginger mouser, who went by the same moniker as the infamous hostile mountain, sleepily looked up from his warm place by the fire at the sound of his name. A picture of brute strength though he was, the feline had a serious case of sensitive bowels. The poor beast periodically leaked brown liquid onto his furry posterior, much to his own chagrin and mortification. Worse even: Erestor vastly disapproved of the besmirched behind leaving brown 'I was here'-stamps around the kitchen. After several useless attempts to keep Lord Caradhras out of his 'favored domain' on Diarrhea-Days (or short: D-Days) Erestor had eventually decided that bathing the bloody cat after an 'accident' was less of a torment than enduring the ear-shattering, gut-wrenching roars and cries of the violent ginger monster when he was locked outside the door. Glorfindel grimaced, but then smiled benignly at the Great Wielder of Talons by the fire. "I shall, shall I not...you orange Breath of Doom?" he cooed. Caradhras purred and blinked serenely, lowering his head onto his front paws to continue his nap. "Dangerously deceptive," Erestor observed as he went to fill the kettle for more tea. A loud giggle could be heard from the corridor, announcing the approach of the newest inhabitant of the Last Homely House, and the door was flung open. "Wor-fee!" came an excited squeal. The small bundle of energy on Elladan's arm bounced his swaddled behind up and down and two little hands�were stretched towards the Golden Warrior. "Hello Estel!" Glorfindel smiled, standing up to receive the precious young cargo into his arms. "Worfee, fly?" the toddler begged, giving his new friend a slobbery kiss. With a broad grin the warrior turned the two-year-old around and tossed him back to Elladan. "You forgot to wipe him," the Golden One chided with mock-sternness. "I do beg your pardon," Elladan smiled, deftly catching and turning the toddler in his arms. "But he is dripping ongoingly. Ada says it is the new teeth." With a whoop of delight the giggling child flew in a high arch through the kitchen and was caught – safely – by Glorfindel. "You shall make him sick," came Erestor's dry comment from the range. The child whirled around on Glorfindel's arm. "Yestor!" he exclaimed excitedly. "Down! Down!" he ordered the blond warrior, impatiently kicking his little legs and prying at Glorfindel's fingers to make the strong hands release him. No sooner had the little feet touched the ground, or the toddler launched himself at the raven-haired Noldo. "Yestor, cookie?" he asked hopefully. Huge grey eyes beamed up at the Seneschal's face. "No, tithen pen, it will soon be time for your meal," Erestor said kindly. Undaunted by this initial denial of his request, the 2-year-old carefully enunciated "Eh-yestor, Agorn cookie peese?" "A four-word-sentence!" Elladan whispered excitedly in the background. "How does he do it?" Glorfindel whispered back, pointing to the Seneschal. "Three weeks here and he already has him trained to say please! " Erestor smiled down on the charming child in front of him. "No, little one. The milk for your evening porridge is already getting hot. Go to Glorfindel for your napkin and sit on your chair." The child paused and studied Erestor's face with interest. "' Stel cookie peese?" he played out his final trump. He had discovered that the use of that particular name brought him far more praise and reward from his caretakers than his old name Aragorn. "No Estel, you may not have a cookie," Erestor repeated slowly and with emphasis. He took the child by the hand and deposited him in Glorfindel's care. The blond Elf aptly distracted the hungry child by tossing a napkin over the tousled head, whispering 'peek-a-boo' in the little, round ears. The toddler giggled and avidly began to climb the warrior's velvet-clad chest, not stopping until he was comfortably seated on the strong, broad shoulders. "Ride, horsey!" he commanded, taking a firm grip on the earpoints that so easily presented themselves for this purpose. While Glorfindel neighed and galloped through the kitchen with Estel, the Seneschal set to work preparing a delicious oatmeal porridge with honey, raisins, pieces of apple, cinnamon and butter. Placing the steaming bowl on the table, he gave a spoon and napkin in Elladan's hands and pointedly cleared his throat to direct the blonde to place the youthful knight on his wooden high chair. o-o-o Grey eyes looked into grey eyes as the heavily laden spoon journeyed from the porridge bowl towards a wide open mouth. "And this one is for…?" Elladan asked, using the now empty spoon to 'shave off' Estel's 'beard'. "Papa!" Estel smiled happily. Glorfindel chuckled. After a spoonful 'for mama' it was only natural that the next one was 'for papa'. He briefly touched his hand to Elladan's knee when he saw a look of anguish flicker in the younger Elf's eyes. "He is at peace now, Elladan," the ancient warrior spoke softly. "I should have scouted the area myself that night," Elladan whispered back, so softly that the child would not hear. "You decided to stay by his side," was Glorfindel's calm, hushed reply. "Had the orcs attacked while you were away, you would have blamed yourself the other way round. Now dry your tears and feed that enormous cave beside you." The spoon with porridge had halted in mid-air, and Estel, mouth wide open, was grasping the front of his tray and leant forward as far as he could – as though hoping to entice the spoon to come to his mouth of its own accord. "Forgive me, Estel. The next one is for…?" Elladan hurried to ask, shoving the spoon into the hungry mouth before wiping it again. "Ada!" smiled the sprout. Behind them, Erestor's eyes filled with silent tears. How had the child come to accept his new family so easily? "Very good!" Elladan praised. "And…this one?" "El-yo-hir!" piped the tike. "Ah! Elrohir will be glad! He loves porridge!" Elladan smirked, giving Glorfindel a knowing wink. His brother had always despised porridge – no matter what delightful fruit or amount of honey Erestor had put into it. "Elladan, if you put less on the spoon, there will be less on his face," remarked the Seneschal, watching the oldest twin perfect his 'shaving skills'. Estel obediently opened his mouth to eat his beard. "Now, let me see, what do we have here?" the young peredhel asked, as the spoon emerged from the bowl crowned with some apple and some raisins. "To whom shall we give this delicious treat?" the twin asked the child, his eyes twinkling when the grey eyes went round. The toddler furrowed his brow as he looked around. To El'dan? To Yestor? Or…? "Worfee!" he announced brightly. The golden-haired Elf instantly opened his mouth widely, evoking giggles from the child, laughter from Elladan and a snort from Erestor. But when Elladan actually moved his hand in Glorfindel's direction, Estel hurriedly opened his own mouth as wide as he could, leaning forward over his tray towards the spoon. Elladan stopped and gave the child a feigned look of surprise. "Do you want it?" he asked. Estel nodded vigorously, and Elladan slowly moved the spoon towards the youngster. Then Glorfindel opened his mouth even wider and leant across the table, pointing at himself, just like the toddler did. "Aah! Aah! Aah!" the two-year-old pleaded with his mouth wide open. The spoon travelled from in front of Glorfindel's mouth to in front of Estel's and back. The small Dunadan slapped his hand on the table – tonsils showing – and fervently pulled at Elladan's sleeve to get the Elf's attention, emitting a loud "Ng ng ng!" when Glorfindel almost managed to snag that yummy bite off the spoon! The spoon circled around the table in figure eights, until, the very moment Elladan steered the spoon within reach of the little hands, Estel grasped Elladan's wrist and hurriedly closed his mouth around the soft delight. Glorfindel chuckled as the child sat back in his chair and gave a contented sigh, munching on the apple and raisin. "And this one is for…?" Elladan asked, holding out another spoonful. "For 'Stel!" the child said quickly, hurriedly opening his mouth again. o-o-o As Elladan continued feeding him, the two-year-old kept a close eye on the Balrog Slayer and on the bowl of porridge. Just imagine that the hungry blond Elf would try to 'steal' another bite of his delicious meal! Glorfindel pouted most convincingly, pretending to be deeply hurt that he did not get fed. As the bottom of the bowl slowly came in sight – and the child's worst hunger was satiated – Estel began to giggle about the antics of the golden-haired Elf-Lord. Encouraged by this success, the Balrog Slayer upped the game by crossing his eyes and sticking out his tongue, causing the two-year-old to burst out in hysterical laughter… precisely when he closed his lips around another spoonful! "Ack! Glorfindel!" the eldest of Lord Elrond's sons exclaimed, as he was sprayed with a shower of porridge. Estel happily clapped his hands when he realized he had managed to do something new, and the peredhel laughed heartily at the utter delight on the little one's face. With a playful grin the Elf bent forward and wiped his face on Estel's bib, blowing a raspberry on the squealing toddler's tummy before refilling the spoon. Up out of the bowl the spoon went… towards the toddler's mouth… Glorfindel bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing as that which he had silently predicted came to pass: Estel blew a loud raspberry in his porridge, spraying more oatmeal around the kitchen. "Estel, no!" Elladan half-heartedly tried to sound firm, but when the child burst into peals of laughter, the peredhel could not resist and crossed his eyes, just like Glorfindel had done before. Estel cheekily stuck out his tongue and blew a raspberry in the air, which Elladan repeated and the two of them dissolved into giggles. The Balrog Slayer exchanged a knowing glance with Erestor as Estel bounced up and down in his chair. Ah! But Elladan was simply asking for it now! The Seneschal solemnly stood by the sink – his arms crossed, but his features relaxed – and calmly watched the proceedings. Elrond's Chief Advisor was intentionally allowing Elladan a most valuable lesson in child-rearing today. He would not interfere… yet. The spoon once again coursed towards the toddler, but when Estel drew a deep breath and eagerly eyed the porridge, ready to blow into his spoon again, Elladan withdrew it. "No Estel, no raspberries," the twin said kindly. Estel eyed the spoon and waited, but Elladan was no fool. A frown appeared above the youngster's
