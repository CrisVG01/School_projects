Reckless I stare at the newspaper; the feelings bubbling to the top of my heart are so unexpected, so wrong. I shouldn't feel the pain I do in this moment. Is this the natural progression—years in the making? The writing on the wall is now bright neon, flashing the words I should have seen before. Like a drug addict chasing that first high, I have spent years chasing something that will probably kill me. Now I know I may never feel that high again-I'm not sure anyone ever does. *****Reckless***** I lay next to him, kissing, letting him touch me in places and ways I'd never let anyone touch me before. The alcohol that flowed through my veins had caused my inhibitions to leave, and let me embrace these feelings that were completely physical. There was nothing emotional involved. I had met Jake earlier in the night. He was cute, very cute, and he was interested in me. I'd had a number of boyfriends since freshman year, but most of those so-called relationships lasted all of five or six weeks. Maybe Jake would be different. I could feel it build. I'd experienced an orgasm before, but never at the hands of someone else. I was close—so very close—when a bang resonated through the window. The sound was startling and caused Jake to jerk his hand out of my jeans. I jumped up, fumbling with the button on my pants as we ran out the door. The music was much louder in the living room than it had been in the bedroom, so no one else had heard the noise. Jake didn't want to go investigate, preferring to go back to the seclusion we'd been enjoying, so I left him standing in the living room with his friends and went outside on my own. Two houses down, by the stop sign, I saw a figure squatting, elbows resting on bent knees, head bowed. I made my way over, recognizing the boy I had crushed hard on a mere three or so years earlier, Edward Cullen. He lived down the road, but I hadn't seen him since eighth grade. We ran in different circles, even though he was technically a jock, playing both football and baseball. "What happened, Edward?" I asked, my voice soft, as I approached him. He merely shook his head, and I noticed he was cradling one hand in the other. It was obvious he had just punched the stop sign, so I took a not-so-wild guess. "No girl is worth that," I said as I kneeled next to him, inspecting his knuckles under the street light. The swelling had already started. He didn't confirm nor did he deny, but the sly smirk he tried to stifle told me I'd hit the mark. He eventually revealed that Tanya, his girlfriend of six months, had gone out with someone else. Ah, high school romances never seemed to last long, not like our parents' had. We talked for a while, Jake and the almost-orgasm long forgotten as I reconnected with my old friend. It wasn't long before we heard his mother yelling his name from the porch, calling him home. He thanked me for being there before he walked off towards his house. As I watched him fade into the darkness, I felt those same feelings I had from that summer when we were still kids. *****Reckless***** As I stare at the picture of you looking so handsome and grown up in your tux, I think back to senior prom and the promises we once made to each other. How I once knew with everything I was that I would be Mrs. Edward Cullen. Funny, life has a way of laughing at our plans. *****Reckless***** "Daddy, I can't believe you threatened him!" I stood, looking at Charlie in disbelief. He had told Edward that either he take me to prom or he was sure he could find another suitor willing to take his beautiful daughter. Edward was on the baseball team, and if they had kept winning, they would have had a game on the same day as prom. While Edward wasn't into all the pomp and circumstance of high school, I enjoyed all the rites of passage and really wanted to go. I wanted the beautiful dress, the dancing and the whole nine yards. Edward wasn't necessarily overjoyed with the idea of dressing up, preferring ball caps and sweat pants, but he heeded Charlie's words. I had to admit I was secretly glad the Summerville High baseball team was eliminated from the playoffs. However, any guilt I had dissipated the moment I descended the stairs and there stood the love of my life, looking all kinds of hot in the black tux. I even managed to overlook the fact that he was wearing a vest instead of the cummerbund I'd asked him to get. That night we went to Summerville's finest restaurant, just the two of us—a real treat because we didn't actually go on real dates too often, preferring to hang out with our families or find alone time. After dinner, we'd driven down to the Battery in downtown Charleston in his parents' station wagon. He claimed it was so he didn't have to use the gas in his SS, but I knew it was the flat surface in the back that made him bring it. He fooled no one, especially not me—he was a horny one. Even though once we started having sex and we did it at every opportunity we found alone time, he still found the need to jerk off daily. Later, we walked in to the dance, had our pictures taken, and danced exactly once to Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes' Up Where We Belong. As the slow beat drifted across the dance floor, we swayed side to side, arms tight around each other as we circled the dance floor. "Did you see Alice and Jasper?" he asked, his tone full of mirth. "I'm surprised they actually made it here. I thought he'd have her dress off her before they got out the door. But I never did see Rose and James." I laughed at our friends. "I think they may have had the best idea," he whispered, all traces of humor gone, his hips pushing into my stomach, letting me feel how hard he was already. I looked up into his eyes, the want I saw there causing my own desire to ignite. "Get me out of here, big boy." I didn't have to tell him twice. He grabbed my hand and dragged me out into the night. There was beach access directly across from where we'd parked, so he told me to wait while he collected the blanket he'd stashed in the back of the car. I watched him as he jogged across the street, the black pants hugging his ass and making it look almost as good as those damn baseball pants did. I smiled when he looked across the street and grinned at me before opening the back of the wagon. A man should not be that beautiful—it was almost unfair. We made our way towards the sound of the breaking waves, stopping only when we found an area between the dunes that offered a little more privacy. The sun had long since set but the moon danced off of the water and the stars sparkled in the black sky, lighting the white sand. Edward carefully spread out the blanket. Edward was not a drinker. He placed a bottle of Champagne and two plastic flutes on the blanket before taking my hand and helping me sit. He had always been very serious about sports, and he avoided participating with his teammates when they partied, so I was definitely surprised. Edward seemed a little nervous, which was surprising because we'd definitely made love a lot. But I found out why as soon as he'd popped the cork and poured us both a glass of the cheap champagne he confessed to having his brother, Emmett, buy. "Bella, I know we aren't ready for marriage," he said, turning to look into my eyes. "But I want you to wear this, a symbol of the promise of our future together." He slid the small diamond onto my finger as a tear slipped down his cheek. "I love you, Bella, never doubt it. No matter what happens, please remember I will love you until my last breath on this earth." "I love you, Edward, so, so much." Tears also slipped from my eyes as I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him softly. Because of our almost public location, most of our clothes stayed on, but we couldn't resist making love on the beach. The traditional southern style skirt of my gown allowed me to cover us both as I straddled his lap, riding him, bringing us both ecstasy under the stars. *****Reckless***** I wonder if your parents miss me as much as I miss them. Sometimes I wonder if losing them was the worst part. Your parents readily included me in everything. I remember the family vacations, dinners, and sitting with them at all of your ballgames. I even still have the handmade Raggedy Ann doll your mom made me for our graduation. It sits in a place of honor in my room and never fails to start a conversation. *****Reckless***** "I talked to Momma and Daddy!" I squealed the moment he'd opened the door, the excitement in my voice giving away the good news I had been waiting to share. "They're going to let you go?" he asked as he pulled me into his arms. "I never doubted it for a minute. Your parents love me." His smugness never failed to turn me on. He was cocky but never arrogant. It was a fine line that so many crossed, but he never did. "Yes! Two blissful weeks on the beach with you and no Riley! Life is good." Esme rounded the corner and said, "You're welcome. I talked to Renee and Charlie before we ever asked you to go. I'm not sure it'd be a worthwhile vacation if you weren't with us." I laughed at his mom's admission. Over the last year or so, Edward and I had spent all of our time together, so neither set of parents remembered what it was like to have either of us alone. Those two weeks were the bliss I had hoped for. Every evening saw us talking about the future as we walked hand in hand, strolling the sandy beaches as small waves breaking against our ankles. We made plans for college, planned our wedding, and talked about our future kids—and then we practiced making them. I don't know if I'd ever been as happy as I was in those moments. *****Reckless***** You were everything a parent dreamed of: smart, athletic, handsome, but most importantly, respectful, to them and their daughter. Renee and Charlie loved you, well, as much as any parent could, knowing that you wanted in my panties, or much to Charlie's chagrin, had already been in them. Charlie had once been you, so he wasn't delusional like so many other parents. He just wanted to protect us, keep us safe and baby free. He also wanted to make sure neither of us sacrificed too much and regretted any choice we made. Even though his intentions were good, it's hard not to look back and blame Charlie sometimes. If only he would have let me go to school with you, you might never have discovered you could live without me. I wouldn't have had to see that look on your face when I asked if you still loved me. Part of me is grateful, the other part, not so much. *****Reckless***** "Bella!" Edward shouted across the courtyard, jogging towards me. A smile took over my features
