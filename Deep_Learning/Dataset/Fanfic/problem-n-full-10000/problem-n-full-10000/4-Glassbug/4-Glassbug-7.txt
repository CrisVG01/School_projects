A/N: I wrote this for a contest but never entered it. It's another story That I can see going to a multi chapter when I get reliable internet and a computer. Let me know what you think. "Good afternoon Isabella." I looked up to see Jessica at the nurses station smiling at me. "When does your maternity leave start?" I can't help but place a hand over my rather large baby bump. I'm nearing the 38 week mark. "One more week to go." I smile at her. I pick up my first patient's chart and start making my rounds checking on all my patients. I've marked Mr Clapp as ready to go to a normal ward. I go through all my patients' files till I reach a new patient who is a John Doe and currently in room 007. Reading his file I take note that he was involved in a suspected 3 way car collision. He arrived at the hospital unconscious and hasn't regained consciousness since. His vitals were stable at the last check an hour ago. I feel a sharp kick to my side and place my hand over the limb and take a deep breath. I look at my phone and open the chain of messages that has not changed in 6 months. 'There is a badger under the house.' I had send him the message on November the 15th at 7.04am. And I can still remember the day like it was yesterday. ******Flash back to the 10th November midday *** I was walking down the hospital hallway after leaving the cafeteria and barely eating my lunch as after the third bite the nausea kicked in hard. "Bella, are you alright?" Angela asks as she sees me walk down the hall slowly. I shake my head before regretting it as the nausea gets worse. "I don't feel so great." I mumbled out as I look at her before everything goes blank and I feel a pair of arms wrap around me. I open my eyes to the feel of rough fabric and plastic sheets under me and harsh white ceiling tiles above me. I groan as I slowly raise myself off the bed and try to get my bearings. "Hello Bella." I flash my eyes to the door and see Doctor Victoria King standing in the doorway - the resident OB/GYN. "Doctor King, I'm so sorry. It must be the exhaustion I'll get up…." "Bella, Stop." She says firmly before entering the room and closing the door. "Exhaustion is one factor to your problem but I am afraid you are staying in bed for the next few days." "Dr King, there is no need….." "Bella, you and your baby need you to rest." She says sweetly making my head snap at her. "Babb-y?" I slowly stutter thinking I've got this wrong and I didn't hear her say baby. She looks at me slightly confused. "Bella, you are dehydrated and pregnant." I stare at her before looking up at the ceiling again. "You're about 8 weeks along but the morning sickness seems to have hit you hard." "I'm pregnant?" I whisper letting it sink in. "Yes. Did you not know?" She asks and I gently shake my head from side to side. "Oh Bella, I'm sorry I thought you knew." She says smoothly then grabs hold of my hand. "Was this planned Sweetie?" I look into her eyes and cry. "No it's not." I watch the concern wash over her face. "Bella, do you want to keep it?" I look at her horrified as I wrap my arms around my middle protectively. "Of course I do." I protectively growl looking at her. "The baby's father works abroad he's not here and has no idea." "Oh." she says patting my hand. "Would you like me to arrange a sonogram and we can have a look at the little one." I smile widely as the thought of seeing the little life growing inside me. An hour later I'm staring at a print out of my baby while I lie in my bed planning on how to tell my husband. *****End flash back***** I waited till I got home to message Edward. He told me if there was ever an emergency I needed to send him a message with the word Badger in it and he would come. No questions asked. He sent me a message back instantly but his arrival never happened. 'On my way. E' Sent November 15th 7.08am I sat on my sofa all week as I was on doctors orders to take the week off and rest. I tried to track Edward down but I couldn't find him anywhere. I went to the club we first met at, his apartment, the park we would have picnics in during our lunch breaks. Even when my head was screaming it was over Edward had abandoned us; even if he didn't know about my secret. He never would and my heart just screamed to keep it together for all three of us. I figured Edward was in some sort of trouble to not have come when he was called. Taking a deep breath and gently pushing at Badgers limb that was jabbing me - painfully in the side - I got up and picked up the file of our newest patient John Doe. Opening John's file I begin reading his file all that is known about him is he was a white Caucasian male, aged 30-35, he had a gunshot wound to the shoulder and a knife wound to the abdomen. I close his file again and walk into the room of John Doe. He came in with no ID, no wallet. He had a dollar in nickels and a disposable mobile phone in his pockets. The second I walk in to the room of John Doe my world comes tumbling down as I look at the unconscious form of the one person I have been desperate to see again. I look over his file again then checked him over. He was stable and his wounds look good according to his file but I need to find out myself. I then hold his hand tightly before leaning down to his ear. "Edward, I need you to wake up baby." I look up as his heart rate speeds up a little before quickly kissed his cheek. "I have something to show you and it's important." I stand up after no further reaction as I stare at the monitor. I'm broken out of my daze by a ringing noise and open the bedside cupboard to the bag all his belongings were put in to find his ringing mobile pressing connect I place the phone to my ear ready to talk to someone. "It's about time you answered! Where are you?" a deep masculine angry voice snaps. "The person you are looking for is lying in a hospital bed after a car accident." I said calmly as I grab Edward's hand and hold it tightly. "Who are you?" the voice snaps back. "Where is he?" "My patient is in the hospital. He is stable but unconscious." I snap back while rubbing Edwards hand. "Now hold on…." "No. you hold on. I am going against protocol here by giving you any information" I growl annoyed until I watch Edwards monitor spike irregularly. I grab his arm and listen as the man on the other end carriers on ranting and shouting at someone. "Sir, I am afraid if you don't give me a name I will be hanging this phone up." I say smoothly "Fine it's Emmett Cul…." I don't hear the end as the hospital panic alarms go off and then I hear gun shooting "Shit." I quietly curse before I start removing the wires and make Edward more mobile. Grabbing hold of the bed I flip the breaks off and start pushing the bed towards the door. When I get there I let go of the bed and slowly pull the door open and look around quickly. When I feel confident the coast is clear I grab the bed and out the door into the hall slowly. "Bella, What the hell are you doing pushing that bed." I look up to see the Chief of staff Dr Carlisle Cullen coming out of a room at the other end of the corridor. I am about to answer when the sound of gunfire fills the next corridor along. "I'm sorry, Dr Cullen, I need to get my patient to x-ray." I say as I try to push the bed again. "Bella, you know the procedure during a lockdown." He says sternly walking towards me. "Oh my God, Edward!" He says as he gets closer "Bella, follow me now." He snaps as he grabs the foot of the bed and pulls his phone out of his pocket. I watch as he puts it on loud speaker at the foot of the bed. "What Carlisle? I'm busy." A stern posh voice says on the other side. "I have cub, he's at the hospital with gunmen here I need a pick up at the usual exit." He says pushing the bed out into a back corridor. "Back up is on the way ETA 5mins." He says before the line goes dead. "Bella, push the damn bed." Carlisle growls at me and I start pushing it again and we slowly keep moving. When we get to the back doors Carlisle leaves me on one side as he opens the door. Before I can start pushing the bed again the doors filled with a giant muscular man with dark skin and black hair who looks at Edward before me. "Not now, there's no time." A shorter Caucasian older black haired man snaps grabbing the foot of the bed. I go to grab the head and start pushing again to see an ambulance with the doors open on the other side I stop in my tracks when I see a short man with black hair sitting in the back with a gun in his hand pointed at me. "If you want to stay in one piece get in the ambulance without a fuss." He orders before I feel a gun pushed into the base of my back right where Badger is currently lying. I climb into the ambulance and watch as the doors close with Carlisle on the other side with big cautious eyes. "Miss, please sit down." The goliathan asks pointing to a chair. Instead I stand up and grab the heart monitor and a new IV line and connect both onto Edward so I can see his heart beat again. I grab the chart on the foot of the bed and start writing down Edwards Stats. "Please Miss" Goliathan asks again and I just turn to him. "If you don't mind sir I'm trying to look after my patient." I snap harshly before jotting down Edwards saturation level. "Miss, You will sit down now!" Mr Black hair orders pointing the gun at me. I take the seat and belt up as I look over at Edward. "What's your name?" Mr Black asks with a stern but gentler tone looking at me. "Dr Swan." I reply looking over at Edward again. "Ah another doctor just what we need right now." Goliathan announces cheerfully I jerk when we suddenly stop and the doors pull open to two more men armed to the teeth on the other side. "Dr Swan, if you'll please." Mr Black says motioning to the door. I unbelt the seat-belt and stand up getting out of the ambulance. I look around and see that we are in an enclosed large parking garage. I follow the gentleman as I am led to a nearby door and then into a lift with Edward. I shift around a bit and try to get near to Edward as well as to make sure no one realises I'm pregnant. When the lift stops
