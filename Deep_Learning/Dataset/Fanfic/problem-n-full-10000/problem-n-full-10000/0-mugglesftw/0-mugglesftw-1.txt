Chapter 1: Yer a Ginger, Harry When people used the phrase, "like a red-headed stepchild" Harry Potter had always thought that they were referring to him. His wild red hair and green eyes stood out against his much plainer and "normal" looking relatives, and it was yet another thing they resented him for. Thankfully, the beatings that were usually associated with red-headed step children were something that Harry mostly avoided, aside from the Harry hunting games that Dudley occasionally played. Fortunately, Harry was scrawny but fast, and usually avoided his overweight cousin and his friends. Sadly, that skill hadn't helped him when his uncle had apparently gone mad and attempted to flee from the mysterious sender of letters addressed variously to the Cupboard Under the Stairs, the Smallest Bedroom, and hotels scattered throughout the country. Despite his Uncle's best efforts though, Hagrid the Giant Wizard had managed to locate Harry and whisk him off to Diagonally. "Look just like yer mum you do," Hagrid had said, rubbing Harry's ginger locks. Harry had smiled, glad to finally have someone appreciate him instead of insulting him. Now Harry was even getting new clothes for the first time in his memory, standing in Madam Malkin's and having his measurements taken. Next to him stood a blonde boy with an annoyed expression on his face, as if getting new clothes was somehow a burden. "Hello," Harry said happily. The boy looked at him and rolled his eyes. "Well, I suppose you're off to Hogwarts then too." "Yes," Harry said, eyeing a magical tape measure as it crept its way up his arm. "Well, red hair and second hand clothes, no need to ask who you are. You're a Weasley." Frowning, Harry felt at his hair. "I'm a what?" but the boy was ignoring him. "Such a shame that one of the Sacred 28 has turned into such a disreputable family. You'll be in Gryffindor with the rest of your brood I imagine, and happy about it you poor sod. You Weasleys even seem to think that's something to be proud of." "Well why wouldn't it be?" Harry asked, genuinely curious. Sneering, the other boy eyed Harry with a measuring look. "Gryffindor is for those with no sense and an overdeveloped hero complex. Your family is famous for their idiotic heroics, especially in the last war." "You're done dear," the seamstress said, and the other boy left Harry alone with his thoughts. Upon further reflection, Harry decided that maybe being a Weasley wouldn't be so bad. After all, Hagrid had said his parents had been in Gryffindor, and Harry rather liked the idea of having a family of heroes. /\/\/\/\\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ Having never been to King's Cross Station before, Harry was feeling rather lost. Hedwig was hooting behind him in the cart, adding a sense of urgency to Harry's wanderings as he searched for platform 9 3/4 . He was just about to ask one of the station attendants when he found himself swept up in a ginger tide. "Come on Weasley's, we're running late again," a woman's voice said as she firmly grabbed Harry by the arm and started steering him back towards platforms 9 and 10. "Charlie, don't wander off again," she admonished, then reached out and grabbed another redheaded child. "George, leave that poor man alone. Don't go sticking gum to muggles shoes, it's not polite. Come on, we have to get to the Hogwarts express before it leaves without us!" Harry relaxed slightly. At least they were going to the same place. And these had to be the famous Weasleys. "But mum, I'm Fred, not George." "Of course you aren't. Charlie dear, hold my hand, I don't want you getting lost." "I'm not Charlie," Harry said, trying to slip free of the woman's grasp. She tsked and shook her head. "Oh, sorry Bill, of course you aren't. Ron, don't let Scabbers get away now, this place is packed with muggles." "Percy help Bill with his crate as we go through the barrier please," the woman said. "You first Fred and George. Yes, I know which as which even if I do get your names mixed up sometimes." A tall boy with horned rimmed glasses and hair just as red as Harry's stepped up beside Harry to steady Hedwig's cage back on his cart. "I'm not Bill either," Harry told the boy. He just shrugged. "No, but it's best to go along with it. She's in a right fit state after what happened at breakfast. Besides, you look like you really could use the help." "I like your owl," a red headed girl said quietly beside Harry. "Are you another cousin?" Harry smiled at her. "Thanks. I guess? I mean, how many redheaded wizards can their be?" "You'd be surprised," the older boy muttered. "Come on, through the barrier, just go straight at it." Once he was through the barrier, the tide of redheads carried Harry along to train car. The woman bent down and hugged and kissed him, smiling and rubbing the top of Harry's head. "Have a wonderful term dear. Remember, we'll be visiting your brother in Romania. Write often! Percy can let you borrow Hermes. Oh, you seem to have your own owl! When did we get you that?" Before she could finally realize that Harry was, in fact, not one of her own brood, there was a bang and she whirled to confront another one of her children and his misdeeds. "Bye!" the girl called, waving to Harry as her mother dragged her away. "I'm Ginny by the way, write to the Burrow and the owl will find us!" "Come on then," the older boy said, grabbing Harry and other ginger boy his own age. "Let's get your stuff stowed before I have to go to the prefects meeting." And then Harry found himself in a compartment, his things safely stowed, his cheek kissed and a woman waving goodbye to him as the train pulled away. "Goodbye Ron, Percy, Bill." She suddenly frowned. "Wait, you're not Bill. Sorry Charlie!" Harry waved back, still slightly confused about the whole situation, but rather pleased that someone had actually seen fit to send him off to school, even if they were a bit perplexed on his name. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ "Another Weasley eh? I know just what to do with you. You belong in Gryffin-" The hat cut itself off. "You're not a Weasley." There was an awkward silence. "It's OK," Harry said aloud so that everyone could hear. "You're not the first one to make that mistake. I don't mind, you can call me a Weasley if you want." The hat atop his head coughed slightly. "Sorry, I just assumed, what with the red hair and all..." "I quite understand," Harry assured the hat. "Mrs. Weasley even thought I was one of her own children." "Well it doesn't help that you have a very Gryffindorish mind," the Hat said sulkily. "I mean, look at all this. Courage, not enough sense. You're almost like one of them." "It's OK, I don't mind being in Gryffindor. I met Ron on the train and we're best mates now." "Well, I appreciate your understanding. I'm not a young hat anymore. Even if you're not a Weasley you belong in GRYFFINDOR!" There was a lot of cheering, and Fred and George hopped up on the table and started chanting, "Potter's a Weasley, Potter's a Weasley." Harry didn't mind. He was rather starting to enjoy being a part of a real family. Percy the prefect even made a space for him and told him not to worry, supper would be along soon. Then Ron joined him, and put his arm around Harry. "Mate, it looks like you're doomed to be part of the family. Even that hat couldn't tell you weren't one of us." "That's quite alright," Harry said, putting his own arm around Ron's shoulder. "I always wanted a brother." "Too bad," Percy muttered. "There are six of us." "You'd think a prefect would be able to count," Fred, or possibly George said. His twin nodded. "Quite right. There are seven of us now after all. Too bad mum left this one with the muggles for a few years." Harry just smiled. /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\ Before potions class started, Harry was very nervous. As a newly inducted member of the Weasley clan, he'd been briefed by Percy on what to expect in each class. "History of magic is a bit dull, but just make sure to have someone take notes during the lecture and the rest of you can sleep through it. If you nod off, ask me and I'll let you borrow my notes from that day when I was a firstie myself. They're probably pretty much the same." "Don't slack off in transfiguration. McGonagall might be our head of house but she watches all of us like a lioness and expects the best." "Professor Flitwick is very kind, but don't make any short jokes. He was a champion duelist after all." "If you ever need someone to talk to, Professor Sprout is your best bet. She's very kind, and always willing to listen even if you're not in her house." "Hagrid is a great chap and if you take care of magical creatures he's a great help. Just don't eat his rock cakes." "Don't let Professor Sinatra's name fool you. She might be from an old pureblood family but she's very nice and always loves to talk about the stars if you get stuck on a homework assignment." "Stay away from Snape. He hates Gryffindor's and us in particular. I'd like to blame Fred and George for that one, but honestly I think it started with Bill and it wasn't any of his fault; he'd never made a boil removing potion before." So when Snape locked eyes with Harry right at the beginning of class, he swallowed and try to look braver than he felt. "Mr. Potter. Our new celebrity." "Honestly sir, the fame isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm thinking of changing my name," Harry said. Beside him, Ron snorted and developed a sudden cough. Mentally, Harry berated himself for mouthing off to a teacher he'd already been told was not inclined to like him. To Harry's shock, Snape's mouth twitched upward in a half smile. "Denying the name of Potter? Surely you wish to honor the memory of your father." "Really sir, I don't know anything about him, and the Weasley's have been very kind to me. Honestly, I wish someone would actually explain what happened to my parents. I'm told I look like my mum, but I don't even have a picture of her." For a moment, Harry thought Snape was going to murder him right there. A viscious expression stole over the potions masters face as his lip curled in anger. Then he whirled about and started firing off questions at various students, with only Hermione Granger of Gryffindor managing to get any right. "What was that about?" Harry whispered to Ron as they tried to follow the boil curing potion. Ron could only shrug. "Search me Harry, I thought he was going to kill you there for a moment. That was pretty brilliant; I don't think even Fred and George have gotten that sort of a reaction out of him." "Weasley, mind your potion, you must stir clockwise three times before adding the nettles," Snape snarled as he wandered past their cauldron. "Yes sir!" Harry and Ron said at the same time, then grinned at one another. For his part, Snape smirked. After class, Snape pulled Harry aside. "If you wish to learn more about your mother, see me in my quarters after supper." Harry nodded eagerly, and right after supper he and Ron both turned up at Snapes quarters in the dungeons, Ron having claimed that Harry would need a witness so that at least they could find his body once Snape was through with whatever dark plans he had
