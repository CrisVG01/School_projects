ThePeetaSpecial has sent you a flirt on 07/15/2012. ThePeetaSpecial? Is this guy serious? I should just ignore it – delete the message and continue browsing this website that I agreed to pay $11.99 a month to because I'm that desperate for a fucking date. I'll just check his profile. If he doesn't fit what I'm looking for, then I'll ignore it. ThePeetaSpecial Age: 50 Gender: Male Height: 5ft10in Relationship Status: Never Married Smoking: Non-smoker Body Type: Athletic Hair: Blond Eyes: Blue Occupation: Baker Looking For: Marriage Children: None Pets: Dog Looking for marriage. There's the buzz kill. His picture doesn't look so bad, though. Maybe I'll just send a flirt back as a reward for those gorgeous blue eyes. Then again, the picture is just his face. What if the rest of him isn't as appealing? He may say he has an athletic build, but I've learned not to believe everything these guys say. He probably weighs more than five of me put together; he is a baker after all, and I bet he has a hairy back. Oh, what the hell… You have sent a flirt to ThePeetaSpecial on 07/15/2012. Maybe that'll be enough to satisfy him, and he can go off and send more flirts to other women that may also be looking for marriage over the internet, but if he's looking for that from me, he is barking up the wrong tree. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Hey Message: Thanks for the flirt. How are you? So much for the flirt satisfying him. At least he isn't getting creepy… yet, like that one guy that was asking for nude pictures before I even answered him. Send message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: Thanks for sending me one first. I'm good… you? I hope that first sentence doesn't come off as flirty; I just didn't want to be rude. Oh, fuck… there he is again. Doesn't he have cupcakes to bake or something? I guess the same could be said for me though; I'm sitting here replying quickly too. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: Can't complain, especially after reading your profile. Personal trainer, huh? Impressive. Here we go. He's opening that door to talk about my body. I should change my profile and take my job off of there, maybe it'll keep these fucking perverts away. Keverdeen62 Age: 50 Height: 5ft3in Relationship Status: Never married Smoking: Non-smoker Body Type: Athletic Hair: Brown Eyes: Gray Occupation: Personal Trainer/Nutritionist Looking For: Casual relationship Children: None Pets: None At least he didn't talk about being a 50 year old personal trainer. I'm really fucking tired of hearing how crazy that one is. Message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: Yep. Since college. I'm surprised you didn't make some remark on my age. Everyone does. I should have changed the subject. Or ignored him. I don't even know why I'm still entertaining this guy, I'm only going to disappoint him in the end when I tell him he's not what I'm looking for and he's not what I need. I don't have time to get serious with anyone, but I don't want to become a nun either. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Subject: Re: Hey Message: Why would I say something like that? I'm sure your job keeps you young. Mine does. What the hell would a baker have to do to stay young? Crack eggs into a bowl? Maybe if I call him out he'll leave me alone. Message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: How does working at a bakery keep you young? There. Explain that one, Muffin Man. He probably sits around eating pastries all day. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: Contrary to popular belief, I don't sit around eating pastries all day. In fact, I don't even have a stock person hired. I move all supplies myself. Bulk sized bags of flour are just as good as benching 150lbs. Well damn. I didn't even know they made bulk bags of flour. And he doesn't have a stock person hired? He sounds pretty important at that bakery. Message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: So you're in charge of hiring at the bakery? Are you a manager or something? I'm going to take a shower. Let him wait a little while for me to read his message and reply. I don't want him to think I'm sitting around waiting for his messages, though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. He wants marriage, Katniss. Stop. Go take your shower. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: I own the bakery. Well that was right to the point. I'll send one more message and then I'm going to bed. I'm not going to be dragging ass with my client at 6am just so I can talk to ol' blue eyes here. Message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/15/2012 Subject: Re: Hey Message: I didn't realize you owned a bakery. I thought when your profile said baker that you maybe worked at Panera for a few months and started calling yourself one. I'm going to turn in for the night. I have a training session at 6am. Goodnight. Why did I just tell him I was going to bed? He doesn't need to know that. I should have let him stew for a while and wonder why I'm not answering him. Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/16/2012 Subject: Good Morning Message: Good morning. I hope you have a nice day. Don't work too hard ;) This guy cannot be serious. I think it's time to cut this one off. Message to: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/16/2012 Subject: Re: Good Morning Message: You did notice that my profile says I'm only looking for casual relationships, right? I don't want you to think I'm leading you on or anything, but I'm not looking for anything serious. There. Now maybe he'll fuck off and stop sending me good morning messages. Jesus, who does he think he is, Casanova? Message from: ThePeetaSpecial Sent: 07/16/2012 Subject: Re: Good Morning Message: Yes, I know that. Don't worry… you're not the only person I'm talking to. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I should just stop right here. Let him go talk to those other bitches. ThePeetaSpecial wants to chat with you. Oh my God. What the hell is this now? Messages weren't enough? ThePeetaSpecial: Hey Keverdeen62: Hi ThePeetaSpecial: How's your evening going? Keverdeen62: Not so bad. Very tired though. How about yours? ThePeetaSpecial: Pretty painless. Do you want me to let you go? You said you're tired. Keverdeen62: No it's fine. I have laundry drying that I have to wait for. ThePeetaSpecial: Ok. How the hell do I answer that? Why did he even start this chat if he isn't going to talk? Keverdeen62: So why do you keep talking to me if you know I don't want anything serious? ThePeetaSpecial: I don't know. You're the only one that seems real. And I'd like to get to know you despite the difference in what we're looking for. Keverdeen62: Ok. Now it's my turn to look like an ass. That's smooth, Katniss. Real smooth. ThePeetaSpecial: What's it like being a personal trainer? Keverdeen62: It's not bad. I get to boss people around. ThePeetaSpecial: Do you like being bossy? Is that flirting? I should probably be offended. Normally, I'd be offended which is stupid since this is a dating site, but that's a pretty ballsy thing to ask someone that you've know over the internet for a little more than 24 hours… I kind of like it. Keverdeen62: Sometimes. You said you can move bulk size bags of flour by yourself. How big is a bulk sized bag of flour? ThePeetaSpecial: I order the 50lb bags and can usually move 3 of them at a time. Keverdeen62: If you can lift that much at once you should have a full body shot on your profile. ThePeetaSpecial: Is that your way of asking to see one? He's smart, this one. Keverdeen62: Only if you're willing to show me one. ThePeetaSpecial: I could e-mail you one. That would require me giving you my e-mail address. It's not like it's my home address, but I can avoid him easier if we contain the communication to website only. I do want to see his body though. It's been so long since I've seen a nice one that belongs to someone my age. I should start offering AARP card discounts for new clients. Keverdeen62: keverdeen62 ThePeetaSpecial: Clever. Keverdeen62: Says the guy calling himself ThePeetaSpecial. ThePeetaSpecial: You got me there. The picture is sent. That was fast. He's smart and eager… and wants marriage. I can't forget that one. He wants marriage. One new e-mail from a Peeta Mellark, who is shirtless in this picture and built like a brick shithouse. Why the hell is this guy on a dating website? He could have any woman he wanted. And he probably does. Maybe that's the problem. How many others did he send that picture to? Maybe that marriage thing is just a ploy to lure in the romantics. They're much easier to get into bed. And now he has your e-mail address. Great job, Katniss. Keverdeen62: You have no business being on a website trying to find a woman. ThePeetaSpecial: Is that a compliment? Keverdeen62: You can say that. ThePeetaSpecial: Well you're not so bad yourself. Keverdeen612: Thank you… ThePeetaSpecial: The scowl works for you. I like a challenge. Go on, Katniss - take offense like you always do. This is the point where you tell him to go fuck himself if he doesn't like what he sees. But he does like what he sees; he just has a strange way of saying it. A strange way that could easily be offensive if his eyes weren't so perfectly blue and innocent. Keverdeen62: Is that right? How am I a challenge? ThePeetaSpecial: Not wanting marriage. Keverdeen62: That will never change. ThePeetaSpecial: See, a challenge. If I wanted to tell my buddies that I'm on a dating website, this would be the moment that I tell them "I'm going to marry that woman." Smart, eager, and arrogant. Keverdeen62: You don't even know me. ThePeetaSpecial: I know enough. Keverdeen62: I don't see how you can. Unless you're looking in my window right now. ThePeetaSpecial: Don't worry, I'm not that weird. Well you sound pretty damn weird right now, Peeta Mellark. I should probably stop this before it gets any stranger. ThePeetaSpecial: Are you there? Keverdeen62: Yeah… sorry. So much for that. ThePeetaSpecial: So what does the K stand for? I'm assuming your last name is Everdeen? Keverdeen62: Yeah, it is. ThePeetaSpecial: What's the K? Krystal? Kandy? Keverdeen62: Do you think I'm a stripper or something? ThePeetaSpecial: Just trying to take a guess. Come on… you know my name, it's only fair you tell me yours. So you can look me up and murder me? Not if I murder him first. What the fuck, Katniss? Go the fuck to sleep, you psycho. ThePeetaSpecial: I really am harmless. Maybe this is why I can't get dates… I scare them off. Oh hell. Keverdeen62: Katniss. ThePeetaSpecial: Unique. I like that. Would it be too forward to say it was also sexy? Keverdeen62: Maybe, but it's alright. Sure you've only known me for a day on the internet, but go ahead and tell me my name's sexy. That's really sane. But his body… Keverdeen62: Would it be too forward if I said you have an amazing body? You're doing a piss poor job of getting this guy to go away. In fact, you're doing the exact opposite. Admit it; you don't want him to go away. ThePeetaSpecial: Maybe to some, but not to me. Keverdeen62: Is that what "The Peeta Special" is? ThePeetaSpecial: No, that's something else… Great, now he's got you thinking about his dick. This is a slippery slope you're on, Katniss. Don't think
