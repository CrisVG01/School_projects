This little baby won 1st place for Judge's Choice for Sassiest Gal and also 2nd place in the Public Vote in the same category! Coors Light for everyone! Disclaimer: Trust me, if I owned any of these characters I would be lying on a beach with a margarita in my hand instead of freezing my ass off in Indiana…okay that's a lie. I love my state but I wouldn't say no to a margarita… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TALRWY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The muggy Indiana night was beginning to cool as Edward Masen turned into the gravel drive of the local ballpark. Pulling up next to an older Jeep that was parked haphazardly on a hillside, he grabbed his mitt and got out. Edward could hear people laughing and talking in the darkness around him as he made his way down to the brightly lit diamond in search of his cousin. Emmett McCarty had always been more like a brother to Edward than a cousin. They had many of the same interests and were constantly getting into all sorts of trouble when they were younger. When his parents announced they were selling their suburban Chicago home and moving back to their small Indiana hometown, Edward immediately called Emmett to tell him the news. "Ed-man, what's up," Emmett yelled into the phone. "Long time no talk." "Dude, we're moving," Edward said. "Cool, where?" "About three miles away from your place." "WHAT! You're shitin' me," Emmett said in disbelief. "I shit you not," Edward said, excitedly. "Mom and Dad close on the house in a few weeks. We'll be in town just before Memorial Day." "Hell yeah! You'll be in town to play in the softball tournament. This is too cool, man. Summer just got a whole hell of a lot more awesome." "Tell me about it," Edward said. "This is gonna rock." "Dude, its gonna be fucking epic." The annual Memorial Day Slow Pitch Softball tournament, Edward learned, was legendary. It wasn't an amazing showcase of athleticism that made it popular but the fact that it was an excuse for those participating to be drunk all night. Since most of them had played when they were younger, the police steered clear of the park and the subsequent underage drinking that took place every Memorial Day weekend. The unspoken rules were simple; don't be stupid, don't fight and your ass stays if you drink. As Edward made his way closer to the diamond, he could see the large outline of his cousin standing near the dugout. "What the fuck, Em?" Edward yelled as he saw Emmett take a drink of his beer. "Couldn't wait for me, I see." "Ed-man!" Emmett bellowed, pulling Edward in for a hug. "Jazz, get my cousin a beer!" Jasper laughed as he reached into the cooler and pulled out a Coors Light, handing it to Edward. "Thanks," Edward said before taking a drink. "You're welcome. So, how've ya been, man?" Jasper asked. "I've been good, glad that we're finally here. Moving sucks." "Ed-man, you need to meet my Rosie," Emmett said, looking around before yelling at a blonde sitting on the bleachers with a brunette. "Rosie, come here and meet Ed-Man." Edward could see the blonde laugh as she and the brunette stood and made their way over. "Ed-man this, is my Rosie. Rosie this is Ed-man," Emmett said after placing a kiss on the blonde's cheek. "It's Edward," he said ,shaking Rosie's hand. "Rosalie, but everyone calls me Rose, or Rosie in Emmett's case." Rosalie said with a chuckle. "This is Alice." "Edward, it's good to finally meet you," the brunette, Alice, said. "Muscles over there hasn't been able to shut up about you since he found out you were moving here." "Ali, be real with the man," Jasper said, wrapping his arms around Alice's waist. "Emmett's been acting like a 12-year-old girl who found out she gets to go to a Bieber concert." "I have not! I've just… okay yeah I've been excited," Emmett said, smiling before walking over to look at the tournament bracket. "So, Edward, Em said that you graduated a semester early," Rose stated. "How'd you accomplish that?" "I took advanced placement classes and then some college courses last summer. It gave me the credits I needed to finish early." "That's awesome," Alice said as Emmett returned. "Hey, has anyone heard from B? We're next game." "She's on her way," Rose said, checking her phone. "Said she'd be here in about fifteen to twenty." "All right, I guess we can start warming up then," Emmett said, grabbing another beer and taking a gulp. "Way to warm up there Em," Alice said as she and Rose walked into the outfield to play catch. Jasper and Emmett introduced Edward to the rest of their team, all of whom had just graduated with them. Jasper explained that a big group from their class had decided to put a team together their freshmen year and it had become a tradition. As they loosened up their arms, Edward felt welcomed into their close knit group. The guys were asking about being raised so close to Chicago and joking with him about living in the "big city." He was throwing the ball to Jasper when a blue Chevy pickup sped into the parking lot, the sounds of "Four Kicks" by Kings of Leon blaring from the speakers. Alice and Rose yelled and ran toward the pickup, which had parked up on the hill. Edward watched as a brunette wearing tiny black shorts, hot pink knee socks, cleats and an oversized sweatshirt appeared with Rose and Alice by her side. They were talking animatedly as she gathered her long hair and pulled it into a messy bun on the top of her head. "Jasper, who's th-" Edward was cut off by his cousin yelling. "Hell's Bells, it's about damn time you got your ass here!" The brunette laughed as she flipped Emmett off. "Sorry, Em, I got here as soon as I could. Now, who's got a beer?" After one of the guys handed her a beer and she downed it impressively, she turned her eyes on Edward. "So, you're Em's cousin." "Ye-" "That was a statement, not a question. These other dipshits may be willing to let just anyone on the team, but I have standards." Edward's eyes went wide as she glared at him. "Now, you're from Chicago, right?" Edward nodded. "You're not a Cubs fan, are you?" "No." "Who's your baseball team?" "Cardinals." Her eyebrow lifted. "You were raised in Chicago but you're a Cardinals fan, how the hell did that happen?" "My dad's side is from Missouri." "Football team?" "Colts." "Purdue or IU?" "IU." "All right, he passed, he can play. Now, let's-" "Um, excuse me," Edward said. She looked at him, waiting. "Who the fuck are you?" The group that had formed around them laughed as she smirked and stuck out her hand. "I'm Isabella Fucking Swan. Nice to meet ya." Hours and who knows how many beers later, Edward woke up curled in a sleeping bag in the bed of his truck, the sun shining brightly and Bella Swan, along with Emmett, staring at him from over the tailgate. "I don't know if he's gonna be able to hang, Em," Bella said, shaking her head and taking a sip of what Edward assumed to be coffee. "He just needs a little more practice. He'll be fine." "I can hear you, ya know. I'm hungover, not deaf." "Well in that case, rise and shine, Pretty Boy." Bella smiled. "We play again in an hour." Edward sat up as she walked away. Emmett watched him, a goofy smile on his face. "Is she always like that?" Edward asked. "That's our Bells. You look like shit, dude." "How are you not hungover? You drank more than I did last night." "Practice. You forget, around here we drink every weekend. It's our main form of entertainment." "Yeah, well, you suck balls. Can I at least have some coffee before we play?" "C'mon, Bells' dad brought us all doughnuts and coffee. I think there's still some left." Over the next couple of weeks, Edward adjusted to small town life. Having only spent a few of his summers with his aunt, uncle, and Emmett, he wasn't too familiar with the many back roads that criss-crossed the county. He found himself driving in an attempt to become familiar with his new home. As he drove the sheer beauty of the landscape he had seen so many times captured him. Cornfields stretched as far as he could see, the small green stalks just beginning to sprout in perfect rows. The trees lining the roads, the blue sky…it was all completely different than the suburbs where he had spent the majority of his life. The people were also the complete opposite of those in Chicago. He wasn't used to the friendly smiles that greeted him everywhere he went. In Chicago, Edward had never really felt like he belonged and as a result only had a few people he would refer to as friends. Suddenly, he had found himself included in Emmett's group and spent most of his free time hanging out with them. His uncle had offered him a job working on the family farm. It was different than he had expected his summer job to be but he liked it. He found himself falling in love with the little town and was thankful his parents had decided to move. The only drawback so far had been that he had only seen the infamous Bella Swan a handful of times since the softball tournament, and each time he hadn't been able to have an actual conversation with her. He couldn't stop thinking about her and had hoped that he would have the chance to learn more about her sometime soon. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TALRWY~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Having been in town for almost a month, Emmett and Jasper decided it was high time Edward was introduced to one of their favorite places in town. Which was how they ended up at the local pizza joint, Giorgio's, after a long day in the fields. As they walked in, Edward spotted Bella carrying a steaming pie to one of the tables. "Bella works here?" he asked Emmett as they sat down. "Yeah, her parents own it." "The place has been in her family for like, fifty years or something," Jasper said. "Her great grandpa was Giorgio." "Oh. That's cool," Edward said as Bella walked over to their table. "Jazz, Em," she said with a smile before looking at Edward. "Pretty Boy. What can I get ya'll to drink? Emmett, say beer and I'll punch you in the beak." "Fine, Pepsi." "Mt. Dew please, B," Jasper said. "Pretty Boy, what can I get ya?" "Pepsi," Edward mumbled, feeling his ears go red. Bella smirked before going to get their drinks. "Ohhh...somebody has a crush on our Queen B," Emmett said with a goofy grin. "What? No I don't." "It's okay, Edward. We've all been under the Bella spell at one point," Jasper said. "I don't have a crush." "Edward and B, sittin in a tree, K-I-S…ow!" Emmett said, rubbing his arm as he looked over at Jasper. "What the fuck, dude." "Stop being a douche." "So what's good here?" Edward said, quickly trying to change the subject. "Everything, but we're getting a pizza," Emmett said. "You can't live in this town without having a piece of Georgio's famous pepperoni pizza. I can't believe I never brought you here when you visited." Bella brought their drinks and a basket of breadsticks. "The usual, Em?" she said, leaning against the back of their booth. "Pretty Boy, these two get a large extra pepperoni. That okay?" "Yeah, that sounds good." "All right-y, I'll get it put in." "Thanks, B, you rock," Emmett said. "Duh," she said. Edward watched her disappear
