Disclaimer: I own a Mac, a shit ton of books and a rather extensive CD and DVD collection, which would be a lot more extensive if I owned the Twilight series...which I don't. I also don't own any songs used those belong to Mr. Jason Aldean. Author's Note: I have been obsessed with country music lately and decided that there aren't enough country singing Edwards in the fandom. Jason Aldean's song "Keep the Girl" was my inspiration, actually pretty much everything by Jason Aldean was my inspiration.

On any given day the average person makes thousands of them. Do I want to get of bed today? What shirt should I wear? Should I quit smoking? Most of them go unnoticed because they become so routine they tend to be forgotten. Choices. In reality they define our daily lives without a second thought. The small ones we barely notice since its the big ones we remember. You know the ones. Should I tell her I love her? What song should I sing? Which ring would she like? How do I tell her? Choices. The big ones are the ones that can decide your life. The ones you can subconsciously put off or try to avoid making. The point when you have to decide which path you take, which dream you want to make come true. Choices. Most of the time you don't realize you made the wrong one. The time you took, all the thought that went into making it seems useless. The heartache you felt, the tears, all could have been prevented. It could have been prevented if you would have just gotten your head out of your ass and realized you could have had both. Fucking choices. *********************************KtG*********************************** May 2010 My forehead is stuck to the leather seat in front of me, not surprising since I haven't moved since getting in at the airport. Exhaustion has sunk its claws into my body and I don't feel like moving. The door of the black SUV opens and I roll my head to the side to see my manager, Seth, holding a hotel key out to me. "You need to be ready to head out at 9 a.m." Seth says as I get out of the vehicle. "The interview with CMT Top 20 is at 10 and sound check at 11. Got it?" I grab my guitar case and bag before walking toward the back entrance of the hotel. "Edward, did you get that? With a nod of my head, I make my way to my room. I open the door and look around the generic room. They all look the same after awhile; same king size bed, same desk, same bathroom. The wallpaper was the only thing that changed and even that was beginning to look the same. Placing my things down I take my phone from my pocket and fall onto the bed. 365 days of non-stop touring with various appearances and days spent in recording studios. It was in those moments when I was in my element. The moments when I knew beyond a shadow of doubt that I was born to do this. After a slow start, things were finally starting to happen. My first single had climbed its way to number one and thanks to country radio, my new single was getting a shit ton of airplay. I was going to be performing at the CMT Awards and the tour had started to sell out many of the venues. With my dream finally within my grasp, I should be out celebrating. But it was when I wasn't performing, recording, or giving interviews that I questioned my choices. It was when I was here in my generic hotel room, in a generic city, phone in hand wanting to call her. Her. Bella. I close my eyes as long wavy brown hair and sparkling brown eyes invade my thoughts. It's May which means spring is in full force in Indiana. Winter would have become a memory as the landscape came out of hibernation. The lilacs would be blooming, their sweet scent mingled with the smell of fresh cut grass. If you were to walk outside early enough, the smell of damp earth and dew would fill the senses. The town would be abuzz as lakers arrived to clean their cottages and prepare for summer. Small shoots of green would be showing in the fields as the farmers prayed for them to be "knee high by 4thof July." In just a few short months the tiny shoots would be woven across the endless fields in perfect rows of corn. The trees would be filled with green leaves and summer's slow approach could be witnessed with every sight, sound and smell. It was her favorite time of the year. My thoughts drift to the way she always smelled like lilacs and summer. How we rode around with the windows down, music blaring over the speakers and a smile on her face. "Babe turn it up!" She yelled over the sound of the wind rushing past the windows "I love this song!" "You love every song Bells," I said laughing as she sang with the Kenny Chesney song from the passenger seat of my truck. "One day I'm going to be singing along to you on the radio." She said with a big smile. "I wouldn't hold your breath on that one," I said looking away as my laughter quickly disappeared. "Mark my words Edward Cullen. One day your songs are going to be playing on that radio," she smiled reaching over to take my hand. "You are too fucking talented to not get signed." A week later I broke her heart before leaving for Nashville. A month after that I signed my contract with Broken Bow Records. Looking over at the clock I see its 10:30 p.m. I wonder what she's doing. Was she getting home from a night out with Alice? Was she in bed reading a book? Was she getting home from a date? Shaking the thought, I get up to take a shower. Later, I sat on the edge of my bed with my guitar resting on my knee and exhausted, but not wanting to sleep. Sleep meant dreams. Dreams of what could have been had I made a different decision. My dreams were of tear-filled brown eyes, words I didn't mean and of regrets. I strummed lazily on the strings, a new melody developing. I sang the words that entered my head. " This life is, full of choices. hard to make one, all the voices, in my head." I kept strumming as more of the melody began to form around the words. " I go one way I lose everything, I go the other way, same thing." Putting the guitar away I fell back onto the bed and allowed sleep to come. *******************************KtG************************************* "Dropping one spot to number two, that was Thompson Square with "Are You Gonna Kiss Me or Not," said Evan Farmer, the host of CMT's Top 20 Countdown. "I'm joined by none other than Edward Cullen. Edward before the break we talked a little about how crazy the past year has been. How are you handling everything?" I looked into the camera smiling. "I have a great family and they've really allowed me to stay grounded," I say. "I've tried to keep myself focused and not get caught up in the celebrity of it. I just go out and do what I love." "Now the album's been out for a few months, is it too early to be working on a new one?" "It'd like to think its never too early," I say with a laugh. "The first album came together fast and I didn't get the chance to write as much of it as I would have liked. The next album, whenever it happens, will have more of my material on it." "So you've been working on new material?" "I've been messing around with some new songs here and there. I'm always writing but everything is still in the early stages. The focus is on the current tour and promotional stuff for the time being." "I'm sure that you won't disappoint." Evan said. "Now, you're an Indiana boy but obviously had to make the move here to Nashville, how's that going? Homesick yet?" I paused. Of course I was homesick. I missed my family, my friends, my small town...and I missed her. "I love what I've seen of Nashville so far, but I haven't really had a chance to get out and fully enjoy the city." I say with a big smile. "I'll always be homesick when I'm not back home in Indiana. That's the downfall of coming from a small town, but Nashville has been a great substitute." "Alright and with that we need to get to our number 1 video for this week, its one I'm sure you're partial to." Evan said with a grin. "Just a bit." I said with a laugh. " Edward, thank you for joining me today and good luck with the tour, I'm sure we'll be seeing you again soon. " "Thanks for having me." I said genuinely. "Well ladies and gentlemen, here it is, your brand new number one video, "My Kinda Party" by our guest Edward Cullen." I wait as the segment finishes before saying my goodbyes and walking out to the waiting SUV. Seth is waiting, not looking up from his Blackberry as he opens the door. "Good job." "Thanks." "Ready for the run down?" "Lay it on me." I say running my hands over my face. "Sound check in 30, downtime, openers go on at 7:15, then you're on at 8:30." I nod, it's the same schedule I've heard for the past few months. "Off stage at 10:45, bus pulls out by 11:15." "Sounds like a plan," I stare out the window as I twisted my phone around. After arriving at the arena I was immediately ushered on stage. Doing shows every night had transformed the crew into a well-oiled machine, a few tweaks here and there and we were ready. Walking into my dressing room, I pulled out my phone to call home. Hitting the "End" button, I glance at the clock on the wall. I have about an hour before I was due on stage. Deciding to work on the song that has been stuck in my head since last night, I took my guitar from its case, along with my writing notebook and a pen. Strumming the chords I hummed the melody as more lyrics filled my brain. " More than once I, packed it all up, but I break down, blame it on the truck. Just couldn't go, just want to be out there making my mark, lay down every night in her arms ." I stopped playing and sat back on the couch, letting the sudden memory invade my thoughts. Slamming the door of my truck I turned the ignition and flew out of the driveway, not letting up on the gas until I passed the "Now Leaving" sign. I could do it. I just needed to keep going south until I reached Nashville. I was finally making a name for myself within the region and even had a few record company execs come to some of my shows. I hadn't told Bella about them though. I started to slow as thoughts of her entered my head. Could I leave her? The speedometer steadily dropped. Could I just leave without saying goodbye? I ran a hand through my hair as I pressed down on
