A/N: Stephanie Meyer owns Twilight and all recognizable characters and situations contained therein. Story is rated M for a reason! Like my other stories does contain drug use, sex, and filthy language. If you're under 18 or easily offended then it's probably not the story for you. Ok this is a Bella/Sam and is kind of an alternate reality counterpart to How Do We Take Our Path to Happiness but you DON'T have to have read that to read this. In this story Sam, Emily, Leah, and Paul are 29. Jared, Brady, Kim, Embry, and Jake, are all 23. Seth and Bella are 21. Bella and Kim are cousins, which is how she meets our favorite Alpha Wolf. **Intro: Sam POV** My name is Sam Uley; I'm 29, married to my high school sweetheart for 8 years now, no kids though. I own my own construction company and am a licensed contractor. I'm also Club President or 'Alpha Wolf' of the Wolf Pack Motorcycle Club. My brother Brady and I founded the Club along with our friends Jake Black and Paul Dixon. Brady's friend Jared Thompkins became our fifth patched member last year. We also have 2 Prospects Seth Clearwater and Embry Call. We aren't a bunch of criminals although we do have some shady dealings and connections. We're mostly small town boys with small town dreams, find a good woman and have a family, work hard, and play harder, but mostly to have a fucking blast while doing it. We run the small Reservation of La Push, Washington. Most of us are sons or grandsons of prominent tribal members; Jake Black's father is the chief of our tribe so it's safe to say that we're involved in everything. We keep hard drugs out and by way of Jake we control the weed business in La Push and neighboring Forks. All in all life is pretty decent. **End Intro** I have that weird feeling like I'm falling, and jolting awake open my eyes and look bleary eyed at the time, 3:00am. Rolling over I find my wife Emily's side of the bed cold and empty. What the fuck? I get up and grab my cell phone and see a txt from around midnight that said, ' Staying with Leah tonight, See you tomorrow after work ~Em'. Fucking seriously? That's fucking fabulous, it's also fucking typical though, Emily is out or staying over at Leah's more often than not these days. I gotta be the only 28yr old dude who's married and hasn't been laid in the better part of a year. It was kind of a running joke in the clubhouse, most of the guys were on me about handling my business, but I guess it's just a testament to how bad shit has gotten that I just honestly don't even feel like trying to fuck her anymore. At the same time I'm fucking tired of not getting fucked. I know that the Black Dog, a bar we hang out at down in Port Angeles, is having a local metal showcase tomorrow night so maybe I'll check that out. See if I meet anyone, I love my wife honestly I do, but we're barely even in the same place at all anymore. Generally I'm lucky if she even comes home 3 or 4 nights a week. She's been going back to her parent's on the Makah Res lately 2 or 3 nights a week and then there's usually a night that she spends with her cousin Leah, or at least that's where she says she is. I've caught her smiling to herself lately and I'm fairly certain she's been having an affair. It would make sense since she certainly hasn't been fucking me the last 10 months. The room is sweltering and I realize Emily must have come home and turned the heat on before going out again and not turning it down. I don't understand why she does that! If she's only going to be home for 5 damn minutes why bother turning on the fucking heat? Getting up I stumble around in the dark in my boxers until I get to the light switch. Hitting it the lamps on the nightstands turn on and I squint my eyes waiting for them to adjust. As soon as I'm able to handle the light I move into the hallway and head out to the living room where the thermostat is. Cursing to myself I see that Emily has it up to 75, what the fuck? Really? 75? Our house is fairly small and cottage like and it heats up quickly even when the temp is set 10 degrees lower. I turn the damn thing off because it'll be all day before this amount of heat dissipates. Looking around I see just how pathetic my life has really become. My house is nice but it's filthy, not messy I mean actually dirty. I don't think Emily has done any of the mundane household chores that stay at home wives do in the last few months and honestly I get home late most nights and I guess I haven't really taken stock of the place in a while. If I didn't know better I'd say I'm the only one living here because it doesn't even look like Em's been home in a month or more. That's ridiculous though, I know she was here justâ€¦Christ, I have no idea when the last time I physically saw her here during the day was. I go back into the bedroom and open up her closet and breath a sigh of relief when I see her clothes are still there. How fucking stupid would I feel if my wife had moved out and I hadn't even noticed? I flop back onto the bed on my stomach and bury my face under the pillow. Not bothering to pull the sheet or anything over me I try to go back to sleep. **Bella POV Much later that day** I'm lounging around my house bored and thinking about calling my cousin Kim hoping that she is up to doing something with me. Kim's mom and my mom are sisters but they could not be more different; where Aunt Rita is sweet, and maternal. Renee is, well to be quite frank Renee is a fucking bitch! She walked out on my dad and me when I was 6 and hasn't been seen or even really heard from since. She would only speak to me if I happened to be at Aunt Rita's when she called, I stopped letting her manipulate my emotions when I was around 11, if she called while I was at Aunt Rita's I pretended I didn't notice. If Aunt Rita asked me if I wanted to speak to her I would politely decline. I found out second hand from Aunt Rita when I was 12 that Renee had remarried and had twin boys. I told Aunt Rita to tell her that I was glad she had found a replacement family and that I hoped she was a better mom to her other kids than she was to her first born, I tried to make it seem like it hadn't bothered me but I had gone home to Charlie and cried my heart out for the next two days at the betrayal. After that Dad had called Aunt Rita and told her not to mention Renee to me anymore, sometimes she did anyway though. Not to be mean or anything but just to tell me when I had a new sibling. At last count I had 3 half brothers and 2 half sisters, usually I wondered if they even knew I existed. Apparently Renee had turned into a baby machine with her new husband, who apparently is Navajo. I remember when I was 5 I had begged her for a little brother or sister, she had told me that she had just about enough responsibility with me. Not that she was ever the one who took care of me. I think I was just too much like dad for her, you would NEVER even think that I had Quileute blood in me. My skin is creamy porcelain with just a hint of peachy undertones, my eyes are a rich chocolate brown, and my hair's natural color is a mahogany brown that came directly from my Grandma Swan. Sometimes I think that Charlie and I just ended up being too white for her. Maybe she hadn't thought that Dad's genes would be so strong and when I came out looking 100% like his side of the family she just couldn't take another chance like that. I don't know. Growing up with just my dad wasn't the easiest, but I would've rather had just him than just Renee, even if sometimes I thought he would have been happier if I had frozen at 10 and not grown up anymore. When boys started getting interested in me at 15 he had taken me down to the target range and given me 3 things that he told me to never be without ever again; the first was a can of mace to put on my keychain, the second was a pink and black Glock 9mm, and the third was a cell phone. He told me that the mace was what I should use first, but that I shouldn't ever hesitate to shoot a bastard if the mace didn't stop them from trying anything stupid, and that in the event of an emergency he was speed dial #2 on my phone. He took me to the range every weekend after that, and I was a damn good shot. I was Daddy's girl through and through. When we found out 6 months ago that he had cancer it was probably the worst day of my life. Dad had been diagnosed with stage 2 liver cancer, and while his prognosis was excellent it was still just so hard to accept that my dad was sick. Charlie was always the strongest man I knew he raised me on his own even before Renee left. I guess I had never really noticed just how much he drank but he probably went through the better part of a 6 pack a day not to mention a bottle or two of hard stuff a week, I wouldn't classify him as an alcoholic but he definitely drank way more than his fair share. As soon as he found out about the cancer though he quit drinking immediately, just done, over. After the first round of chemo he had been so sick he had gone to see his doctor and the doctor had given him a medicinal marijuana card. He came home and we talked about it he said he had no idea where he was supposed to go to get weed, obviously he couldn't go into Seattle all the time to go to a dispensary. I told him honestly that I sometimes smoked and that his friend Billy's son Jake operated a legal grow op that did business with the local med-card holders and also did some side business with the local stoners. He honestly couldn't bring himself to go buy weed and I guess I could understand that, I mean Dad's been a cop since before I was even born, so the man has been the law for almost 3 decades. He ended up asking me if I would mind picking up for him. I told him I would do it if he would smoke a bowl with me. He was reluctant but agreed and since then we've smoked together at least once a week. I didn't think that Dad and I could get closer but smoking together had really allowed us to open up to each other, we had had a long discussion about Renee and how I felt about her other kids. I told him that I had always wanted a sibling but that I had
