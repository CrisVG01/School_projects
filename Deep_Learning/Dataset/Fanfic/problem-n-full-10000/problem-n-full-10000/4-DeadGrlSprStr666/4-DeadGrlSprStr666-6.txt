Oh, and Charlie is dating Embry's mom and has been dazzled by Edward and now wants Bella to date Edward despite the fact that she hates his guts! Oh, and did I mention Bella is Paul's imprint? What a Mess! A/N: I know, I know, you're saying to yourself 'DGS WHY? Why would you start yet another new story when you already have 4 stories still in progress?' The answer is simple, this idea blitzed into my brain and I couldn't NOT write it. Enjoy! **Paul POV** As I smashed my fist into the captain of the football teams face I knew that I had finally gone too far. Sam was running towards us as fast as his legs would carry him from one direction while the Principal, Vice Principal, and Dean of Students were all running towards us from the other direction. Brian's nose was a lump of cartilage that would definitely require surgery to fix, and it was spraying blood like a veritable fountain. His lip would need stitches as well but all of it was his own damn fault! I had been minding my own fucking business walking into the building when he had slyly whispered, "Sup Dixon, how's your daddy? Still drunk from the weekend? Did he send your mommy to the hospital again? God your family is such pathetic trash!" To be fair what really pissed me off the most was that he was right. My family was just out of control. Dad a drunken tattoo artist who fixed cars on the side, Mom too weak to ever be anything more than his punching bag, and then there's me. Paul Dixon is my name, and fucking up is my game. I'm 18 years old, been held back once already, and what no one other than the Elders, and my 3 best friends and Pack mates know is that I'm a werewolf. Actually, we all are. Sam, Jared, Sam's younger half brother Embry, and me. We're The Pack, and we keep our lands safe from vampires. Or we would keep them safe from vampires, if there WERE any fucking vampires to keep them safe FROM! Don't get me wrong, there are vamps here, the fucking Cullen's, but I'm talking about Vampires we're actually allowed to kill, and in the year and a half that I've been a werewolf there have been exactly 0 such vamps. Thank God that when the Cullen's moved back there were only three of them, otherwise we'd be up shits creek without a paddle . According to the legends there used to be more, but I guess the others had moved on with their eternity. Sam reaches me and pulls me bodily away from Brian yelling in my ear, "God DAMN IT, PAUL! What the FUCK were you THINKING ! They're going to expel you for sure this time!" I almost laugh, expulsion, so what? Did he think my dad would give a shit? Hell, my old man was lucky to make it out of high school with a tenth grade education himself! What could they possibly do to me? Expulsion. What a joke! The Principal and VP rush over to Brian and help him to his feet as they exclaim over his pathetically broken nose. The Dean however, Mr. Shen, strides right up to me where I'm being restrained by Sam and gets right up in my face, "Well, well, Mr. Dixon. I really wish I could say that I'm surprised that it's you again , but we both knew this was coming since the beginning of the year. I wish I could say that it gives me no pleasure to do this, but you've had this coming for the last month. Paul Dixon you are expelled from La Push High School effective IMMEDIATELY! I will send the contents of your locker home with Mr. Tompkins." I snort, "Don't bother, it's EMPTY. Has been since the beginning of the year. I'll send my textbooks in with Jared, or Embry tomorrow." He shakes his head, "Paul, for what it's worth, I hope you find a school that will take you, and that you get a hold of this anger of yours before you kill someone." Mr. Shen turns to Sam, "Mr. Uley, please take your friend, and both of you get off school property." **Bella POV** There are exactly 5 minutes left of the lunch period. My hands are sweating, my stomach is clenched in knots, and Edward Cullen is staring at me, AGAIN . He's so creepy with his messy ginger hair, and his beyond pale skin, I mean I'm like milk, and even I'M darker than he is! It's not even so much his appearance, because by conventional standards he is good looking. There's just, something about him that doesn't feel right to me. I take a deep breath and try to relax. I know that it's not going to work, but I try. Jessica and Lauren aren't speaking to each other, again . This time it's some nameless Quileute sex God from down on The Res that they're arguing over. Mike is sitting between them and looking rather forlorn. I guess he's wishing he hadn't taken quite so long to realize that I was never going to be interested in him. Now he's interested in both Jess, and Lauren, and neither of them will give him the time of day. I look down at my worn in jeans and baggy t-shirt. I had hoped that if I started dressing extra frumpy that Cullen would lose interest in me. No such luck though. If his ridiculous obsession with me didn't let up soon I would be forced to bring my dad into the equation. Christ how pathetic am I? 17yr old girl needs her daddy to deal with boys who wont take a hint? Yeah, that's how pathetic I am. I almost wish I could call my mom and talk to her about it, but knowing Renee she would hear the name Cullen and insist that I marry him. Or at least fuck him, and fake a pregnancy in hopes that I'd get a payout to get rid of it. Oh well, that's mom. My absolute best friend, Angela Weber, looks up from where she's sitting with her head bowed close to her boyfriend Ben's, "Bells? Are you okay?" Snapping out of my panic I turn to her, "What? Yeah. I'm fine. Just, Stalker-boy will NOT stop STARING at me! I swear if this shit keeps up I'm going to tell my dad about it." Angela tilts her head slightly, there's no way he could know that she's looking at him, but he turns and catches her eye none the less. I don't know how he's able to do that EVERY FREAKING TIME! She shudders, "He is soooo Creep-tastic!" I nod, "I know, right? God I wish Mr. Banner would let me trade lab partners. I told him Edward made me really uncomfortable and he just laughed! He told me that, and I quote, 'Bella, Mr. Cullen is just shy. Really unless he actually does something to warrant your complaints my hands are tied'. Even me threatening to tell Charlie didn't move him! I swear Edward has all the teachers under a spell! I told you about when I went in the first day to try and change out of that bio period right?" Ang nods sympathetically, "You did, and I agree! He's a total creeper! Just do your time with him in bio and you know Mike and Tyler, me, and Ben are all there to walk you out after." The bell rings and I freeze. Like every other day this year the hair on the back of my neck stands up and I know he's behind me. Like, right behind me. Angela scowls at him, "Can we help you, Cullen?" He sneers at her, "You can't, but Isabella can." Setting my face in a scowl I turn to him, "What can I help you with?" He smiles indulgently at me, like a man interacting with a child throwing a tantrum, "Isabella, I would very much appreciate it if you would walk with me to Biology." He stares deep in my eyes as if willing me to accept and I quirk an eyebrow at him, "Are you trying to hypnotize me or something? Because if you are I think you need to practice more. I've told you every other day this year so far Edward, I'm not interested in you, I don't like you. Quite frankly you creep me out more than a little. So NO, I will NOT walk with you to biology. I'm walking with Angela, Mike, Ben, and Tyler. Like I do every day . I will see you in class." His eyes darken and he turns quickly on his heel and strides away. Turning to Angela I curl my lip in disgust, "Creepy little ginger, isn't he." Ang nods and Ben puts an arm around her as Tyler lopes one arm low on my waist. I roll my eyes, and shrug him off, "Don't you start too." He laughs, "Please bitch, you know you are not my type, I'm just tryin to do you a solid. You know maybe if you went out and found yourself a man Cullen would ease up off of you. I mean think about it, you are seriously the ONLY girl in our grade who's a virgin. Maybe that's what he's into." Rolling my eyes as we head out of the caf and down the hall I ask, "How do YOU know I'm a virgin?" He laughs, "Please girl, I know EVERY guy in this school, if any of them had popped your cherry I would KNOW." Snorting derisively, I reply, "And how do you know that I didn't find an outsider to do it? Hell, maybe I've been having some fun with Jess and Lauren's nameless Quileute sex God myself." Tyler snorts and almost falls he laughs so hard, "Bella the day you go out and have sex with a guy whose name you don't even know is the day that I join the fucking debate team!" This is the problem with going to school with the same people for the last 14 years. Everyone knows your business, even if you don't have any! We walk into the classroom and I wipe my sweaty palms on my jeans as I make my way to my seat. As I approach the table I see that again Cullen has moved my chair as close to his as possible. Sighing in disgust I pull it as far away as I can get without being in the aisle and I throw my backpack on the floor between us. Edward feigns hurt, "Isabella, please, what have I ever done to make you dislike me so thoroughly?" Snorting in disbelief I hiss back, "How about calling me Isabella when I've told you specifically at least 10 times that I prefer to be called 'Bella'. Or maybe it's the fact that I caught you attempting to sneak into my yard when my father was working an overnight shift. Or maybe it's the fact that I've told you at least 45 times this year ALONE that I don't like you and that I
