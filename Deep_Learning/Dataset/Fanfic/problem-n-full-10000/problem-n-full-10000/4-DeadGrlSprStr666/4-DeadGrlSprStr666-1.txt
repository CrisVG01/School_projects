Oh. Good. Emily is cooking. My name is Sam Uley, I'm a twenty-one year old man who moved my girlfriend in way too soon, and way too young. The last three years have gone from cohabitant bliss to cohabitant annoyance, the little things I didn't notice when we were living apart are now the huge things that drive me insane. The way she talks to me like I'm an infant, or some sort of small dog, the way she always has to be the center of my attention, the constant checking up on me, showing up at sites, coming by my office, calling me every hour on the hour. She's not a girlfriend, she's a fucking probation officer in an apron. Don't get me wrong, I think I love her, I just wish she would back the fuck off a little. Dragging myself out of bed, I throw on a pair of blue and white striped boxers, and an undershirt, and make my way through the living room. I grab the paper off the coffee table and head into the kitchen hoping that reading the sports page will keep her off my back for the duration of the meal at least. Emily sets a plate down in front of me, she's fully dressed, and it annoys the crap out of me…she doesn't work, doesn't have to, yet she's up and dressed with breakfast cooked before I've even really woken up. It's like she's auditioning for the role of my wife, she does the things that wives are expected to do but without the title. At first I loved it, now, well honestly, some mornings I just want to eat a cold bowl of cereal or toast myself a fucking Pop-Tart. I pick up my fork, and reluctantly start to eat the scrambled eggs, they're good, but that's not the point. I've barely swallowed the first bite, and Emily speaks up, "Sammy, I want us to go out tonight." Sammy…I fucking hate that nickname, and she knows it. Setting my jaw, I ask her, "Where do you want to go?" She smiles indulgently at me, that look on her face that tells me that if I don't want a fight I had better go along with what she wants to do tonight. After about a half a minute, she replies, "I want to go to see that new movie, you know, with the girl who's in love with the vampire. Choking on my eggs, I clear my throat, "That's not really my kind of flick, Em. Can't we see something both of us will like? Why don't you ask one of your girls to come down from Makah for the night, you guys could go out to dinner, catch the movie, really make a night of it." She scowls a little, "Well yeah, I could do that, but I want to see it with you! I want to have a date night Sammy, please !" She pouts her lips and does the sad face, and of course, I grudgingly cave, "Fine Em, we'll see the movie. I have to get ready for work." Getting up I head back to the bedroom, ignoring her shouted, "You haven't finished your breakfast yet!" Grabbing my phone off the nightstand I check my appointments, I had a consultation with Police Chief Charlie Swan up in Forks first thing, apparently his wife had had it with his DIY tendencies, and insisted that he call in a licensed professional after he left a gaping hole in his daughters wall when he tried to fix a stuck window. **Bella POV** I'm woken at the obscene hour of 8:00am on my first day of my first week of Summer Vacation by my dad sticking his head in my door, "The construction guy is gunna be here in about a half hour Bells. You know he'll have to come in here." Rolling my eyes I look at the plastic covered hole where my window used to be, "You think? I'm getting up. I'll be ready by the time he gets here." My 18 year old brother Embry calls up the steps, "Bells! I'm going to the beach with Jake, and Quil, do you want to come?" Hmm, do I want to go to the beach with Jake and Quil, yeah I'm gunna pass on that. Jake will spend the whole time either glowering at me over our break up back at the end of April, or trying to get back into my pants, and Quil, well, let's just say that Quil can't go 3 seconds without making a sexual innuendo and leave it at that. Calling back down, I answer, "No thanks Emb! Have a good time though!" The only reply is the door closing heavily behind him as he runs out of the house, and the sound of his motorcycle revving as he tears out of the driveway. Dad shakes his head in good natured amusement, "That boy…" I roll my eyes, if that was me tearing down the road on a bike he'd have been after me in 2 seconds flat to haul my ass off of it. My mom, Kay, well, my step-mom really, but the only mother I've ever known, calls up to dad, "Charlie! Honey, your breakfast is ready!" She calls to me next, "Bella! Do you want something to eat?" Dad turns and hurries down the steps, as I call back, "No thanks Mom! I'll get a Pop-Tart when I get out of the shower!" Heading into the bathroom I close the door without bothering to wait for her reply. I turn the shower on, setting it just warm enough to be comfortable before stripping down and stepping in. I can hear the faint voices of my parents in the kitchen, arguing good naturedly about god knows what. Probably Embry's motorcycle, that's usually the topic of their arguments. Renee, my biological mother, had walked out on Dad and I when I was just a year old, she just really didn't want to be a wife or a mom. Dad started dating Kay when I was three, and Embry was four, and they got married a year later. Now I'm two and a half months shy of eighteen, it's the summer before senior year, and for the first time in two years I'm single for the summer. Finishing up in the shower I turn the water off and step out. I dry off and head back across the hall to my room. I turn my stereo on and start Godsmack's self titled album before going into my drawers. I pull out a black bra and thong set with little pink stars printed all over, stepping into the panties I pull them up over my hips adjusting the strap so that I can barely feel it. Pulling the straps of the bra up my arms I settle my breasts into the cups and hook it closed before adjusting it so that my breasts are thrust up and out. Crossing back over to my closet I grab out a pair of tiny denim shorts and put them on, pausing I scan my closet. Do I want to wear the hot pink v-neck tee? Or my black Rob Zombie baby tee? The pink shows a nice amount of cleavage, but the black hugs my figure nicely. Before I can decide, my door opens, I turn towards it, expecting my mom. My mouth drops open in shock as a tall, built, Native American man with spiky black hair wearing jeans and a plain white fitted tee comes in ahead of my dad who I now hear talking in the hall. I let out a shrill shout, "Hey!" The man stops short staring at me like a deer in the headlights, I turn back to the closet yanking my pink v-neck off the hanger and pulling it on over my head quickly. Spinning back around, I find my dad scowling, first at me, and then even more deeply at the very good looking man who is still caught up staring at me with his very sexy green eyes. Dad turns his attention back to me, snapping, "Bella! Go downstairs. Your mom has your breakfast ready." **Sam POV** Shit. The girl brushes past me, the scent of her shampoo setting me on edge. She's probably only 16, and her dad is probably about to bust me for being a fucking perv. Fuck, we should have knocked… Chief Swan claps a hand on my shoulder, gripping tightly, but not overly so as he grits out, "Now, I know that there are some things a man can't help. But I'll tell you honestly Mr. Uley, that if I ever catch you lookin at my baby girl like that again it'll be my gun doing the talking. She's still in high school for fucks sake! Hasn't even started her senior year yet." Oh shit! I am a fucking perv, and I deserve to be busted! Chief Swan clears his throat, and gestures to the gaping hole in the wall that's covered with plastic sheeting, "Uh, that's it there." Gaping at it in shock, I manage to ask him, "No offense Chief, but how in the hell did this happen ?" He laughs good naturedly, "I honestly have no idea. I took the blame for it, but it was really my boy who did it. His sister asked him and his bone head friend to open her window because it was stuck. I think they tried to wedge it open with a screwdriver and a sledgehammer. They probably knocked the molding loose, and then tried to hit it back into place, and ended up knocking out the whole window." I nod, "Okay, well that explains how it started, but how did it end up going all the way down to the floor?" He turns a light shade of pink, and rubs the back of his neck, "Well, you see, my daughter. She wanted one of those big fancy windows with the kind of grid pattern… they go from the floor up. I tried to install it myself but that didn't turn out so good. My wife insisted that I call in a professional when she saw the hole." Keeping my tone professional, I sum up, "Okay, so your daughter wants French windows. Does she want the kind with the half circle on top? And do you want the kind that open?" He thinks about it, "I'm going to say yes to the half circle, and no to the opening…" I see him looking at the tree that sits right beside the hole, and I understand why he doesn't want the window to open. That tree is just begging for some horny teenage boy to climb up it, or for a horny teenaged girl to climb down. Turning back I nod, "Okay, well I'll go get a price on the windows and get back to you with an estimate in a few hours." **Bella POV** I hear voices a minute before my dad and Sexy Construction Guy come into the kitchen. I catch SCG's eye, and smile, disappointed when he looks away without returning it. I scowl at my dad, he probably threatened to shoot SCG for the way he was looking at me in my bra. Mom asks, "So when do you think Bella will be able to have a fully enclosed wall again?" SCG thinks about it for a minute, before answering, "I think probably by next week, ma'am. I was just telling Chief Swan that I'm going to
