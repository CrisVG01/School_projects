Story is rated M and contains the recreational use of marijuana, underage drinking, adult language, and sexual content. A/N: This story is a Bella story, and also a Bella/Sam imprint story, it is set in an alternate reality Twilight where Edward never introduces Bella to the rest of the Cullen's, Bella never establishes a friendship with Alice, and she never figures out that they are vampires. This is loosely based off of my one shot story A Werewolf on Elm Street, though the timelines aren't going to be quite the same. There are going to be some big time skips, and some mention of Bella dating Edward. **Bella POV Phoenix AZ The day after Christmas.** Renee drops me at the airport, "You don't have to do this Bella." Sighing, I reply, "Yes. I do. You know I do." She gives me a quick hug, "Thank you. Give Charlie a chance Bella, he's your dad." Snorting derisively, I interject, "Yeah, all of a sudden after 17 years he's my dad and he wants to get to know me… If it means he'll pay for college, that's all I care about." She nods, "still, it'll be more pleasant if you try a little Bell." Shrugging, I reply, "I know. I will. Bye mom, love you." A tear drips down her face, "I love you too, Baby. Call me tonight. I'll be unreachable starting next week." I can't stand it when she cries, and I don't want to cry my way through the airport, so I grab my backpack, and get out of the car. The heat is stifling, it envelops me as I make my way into the airport. The stark difference in the temperature, as I walk into the airport is almost overwhelming. Frigid air slices through the black tee shirt dress that was my uniform at the diner that I had worked at since the summer before my freshman year of high school. I had hemmed it about 3 inches shorter than it had been when I worked, and it grazed my upper thighs as I hurried to the security line. I make my way to the gate, and sit down to wait, hugging my backpack to my chest. Forks, apparently my birthplace, though I had no memories of it. Charlie Swan is my father, in the loosest sense of the word. He hadn't seen me since I was a year old. His choice. He's a cop, or at least he was. He had made his way up in the world, had been Captain of the Port Angeles Police Department. His work was his life, he didn't have time to devote to a wife, or a daughter. Now apparently he's retired, and he wants to get to know me. Originally I said no. He hadn't made time for me in his life, why should I make time for him in mine now? His answer was his pension and annuity fund, he would use them to pay for college for me, anywhere I wanted, but only if I came to live with him after Christmas and finished out high school with him. The boarding announcement is made, and I board the plane that will take me to my future. **A Few hours later, Seattle, Washington BPOV** Getting off the plane, I see the man I know to be Charlie holding a sign that says 'Bella' on it in plain black marker. Going over to him I wave a little as I get in front of him, "Hey, Charlie." He scowls at me slightly, "Don't call me Charlie, Bella. I'm your father." I roll my eyes slightly, "Sorry Dad." He sighs, but doesn't say anything about the eyeroll, as we head towards the exit, instead saying, "It's a 3 hour drive back to Forks, if you have to go to the bathroom you had better do it now." I take the opportunity to walk away from him, "Okay, be out in a minute." Well, this is off to a great start. Taking out my cell phone, I call my mom. It goes to voicemail. Shit. Hopefully she remembers to charge it, I want to talk to her before she goes on her pilgrimage with Phil next week. I do what I have to do in the bathroom, and go back out to meet Charlie. He nods at me, and we make our way out to his car, not surprisingly it's a dark blue Crown Vic, an undercover cop car. He smiles at me as he starts the car, "I'm really glad you came, Bella. I'm sorry that I haven't really made an effort to be in your life, I'm really hoping to make up for that. So, tell me about yourself?" **One week later, first day of junior year after Christmas break BPOV** I lay awake waiting for my alarm to go off and tell me it's time to get up and get ready for school. The last week with Charlie has been interesting, he bought me a car, well a truck really, it's older than he is, and full on metal, he stuttered out something about Renee having bad luck with cars, and in case I took after her in that regard this would keep me safe. On the way back from the airport I started to understand that Charlie really was just as nervous about all of this as me. It helped to start to thaw the ice I felt towards him, at least a little bit. Apparently Charlie isn't retired though, he's now the police Chief in Forks. Finally the alarm goes off, well, here we go. **Eighth Period, BPOV** The day has flown, I ate lunch with a bunch of kids, they had apparently all gone to school together from like kindergarten, and you could tell that they were starting to get sick of each other but that they didn't want to leave their friends either. I guess that's where I came in, but as lunch came to a close I saw them . Jessica, a slightly snotty brunette, saw me looking at them, "Don't bother, those are the Cullen's. They don't associate with us mere mortals." If Jessica hadn't been speaking so quietly I would have been worried that they heard us. One of the boys turned his head and met my stare, I dropped my eyes quickly, but I knew he saw me looking. They're all very good looking, there are 5 of them, 4 are pretty obviously involved, the lone boy is the one who caught me looking. For the rest of the period I felt his gaze, but I didn't dare look in their direction again. Now I'm sitting in Biology, and guess who my table mate is…that's right, Edward Cullen. For a split second when I sat down he looked like someone had jabbed him with a cattle prod, maybe he just liked his space. The bell rings, and I get my books together, and start putting them in my bag, as Edward asks, "So Bella Swan, where'd you move from?" He's smiling at me, his eyes are a warm liquid gold color, my breath catches, I'm lost in his eyes. I've never felt like this before. Is this what love at first sight is? **Three weeks later** Edward and I are sitting in his car after school, this is pretty much all we do. We started dating the second day of school. I think he's ashamed of me though, he never even introduced me to his brothers and sisters, and he never sits with me and my friends. It's like we're secret boyfriend girlfriend. Sighing, I ask again, "Edward will you please come over and have dinner with Charlie and me? He's getting kind of insistent." Edward rolls his eyes, "Come on Bella, you haven't met my parents yet, you don't see me harassing you about that." I start to reply, tell him that I would love to meet his parents, but he turns towards me, and catches my eye, and I decide not to ruin the moment. **Six months later, The day before Summer Vacation** Edward and I sit together at lunch. Alone. He had decided about a month ago after dating for 5 months, that he wanted to sit together alone, rather than him sitting with his siblings, and me sitting with my friends. It took about a month of asking, but Edward had finally met Charlie. Things with Charlie and I were much the same, he made it a point to come home after his overnight shifts though once he realized that Edward and I were really dating. Not that it mattered, to say Edward is a bit of a prude is being kind. It's the last day before Summer Vacation, and Edward is going to Mexico with his family tonight, but he promised to come over before they left. I still haven't met his parents, but I guess that doesn't really matter. **A few hours later BPoV** I greet Edward at the door, "Thanks for coming over baby. I'm going to miss you so much while you're away!" Edward scowls, then sighs, "Bella, can we go for a walk in the forest out back?" Shrugging, I reply, "Sure thing, whatever you want." We go through the house, out the back door, and I follow him a few yards into the forest. Stopping, he turns to face me, "Look, Bella. I've really enjoyed my time with you, but this isn't working for me anymore." Confused, I ask, "What do you mean?" He rolls his eyes a little, "Look, Bella. You're a great girl and all, but I'm moving. The family isn't coming back here from Mexico. This is going to be the last time I see you. Even if we weren't moving, you're just not what I'm looking for. It's over." My brain feels fuzzy, I can't breathe, I see him moving away from me, he's moving so quickly. I try to follow him, I try to call out to him to stop, but no noise escapes my lips. So instead I just keep following, hoping he will realize and stop. He doesn't stop, and I follow him off the path, into the dark, I can't stop following him, it's like Alice and the White Rabbit, I just keep going, until I trip over something, probably a tree root or something like that, I feel myself falling. I land on something cold and wet, I can't move. I have no desire to move. He's gone, he's gone… gone, gone, gone… **11:30pm, Sam POV** My phone rings, looking at the readout I see it's Chief Black, and I answer, "Hey Chief, what can I do for ya?" His voice is frenzied, anxiety and panic the only emotions, "Sam, I need you to go into the woods, my friend Charlie Swan's daughter is missing! She went into the woods with Edward Cullen sometime after school and hasn't been seen since!" Shit. Not good. If she's hurt, or worse, it will cause a war between my Pack and the Cullen's. My two friends and I are werewolves, it's kind of a long story, all about tribal magic and tradition, the bottom line being that because the Cullen's came to live in Forks, we changed to protect our people from them. I try to keep my tone calm, "Okay, I'll tell Paul and Jared what's going on, and then come to you, I hope you have something that smells like her, it'll make it easier." He replies, "Come to Charlie's, he's worried sick about her." He gives me directions and we get off the phone, Paul and Jared are on my couch playing halo, they look up as I get off the phone. Paul asks, "So what did Chief Black want?" Standing, I answer, "Apparently we have a job to do.
