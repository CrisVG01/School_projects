This was an entry for the 2012 Home For The Holidays contest on Tricky Raven Disclaimer: Stephanie Meyer owns all things Twilight. Wolf Pack MC, the Packs' MC personas, and all original content are property of the author. I just want to be clear that though this story takes place in the Wolf Pack MC: Alpha Wolf universe, it is NOT a future take from that story, more of a future 'what if', if that makes sense. **15 years in the future Bella POV** My eyes open as the grey light of dawn hits my window on December 24th, and my youngest son jumps on me, I hug him tight as I try to adjust, even six years later I'm not used to the empty side of the bed beside me. Six years my husband has been gone, we had a good life, a seemingly charmed life, and then, our luck had run out. A botched run, associates who weren't as careful as we were, Sam and Paul had been caught red handed laying a beat down on a man in a drug house. I was three months pregnant with our fourth child, the other three all under 10, when I got the call. By the time John was born, Sam would already have been inside for 6 months. He doesn't know his father, not really, not the way that our other children know him. All the memories that John has of him are from letters, brief phone calls, and the once monthly visits he gets with him. The jail has a lot of rules about visits, one visit a week, and only two visitors at a time. Sam's Pack brothers aren't allowed to visit him, though they can write, and he can call them, and Brady, his brother by blood, is good enough to understand that my kids and I need the time with Sam more than he does. Neither Sam nor Paul would co-operate with Clallam County Sheriff's office. They plead no contest, and the Pack's lawyer Jasper Whitlock had done some pretty fancy legal maneuvers to get them a ten year sentence, and put into a relatively close facility. They could have gotten up to fifteen years apiece, or charged with federal crimes. They were supposed to be out in 5 with good behavior. Of course things couldn't go that smoothly. Paul got in a fight. Sam saw the shank in the other guys' hand, and jumped in, the other guy lost an eye and 3 years were added on to their sentences. My 14 year old son, my oldest, steps into my room. Fitting that he, as Sam's namesake looks so much like him, but sometimes it just breaks my heart to look at him. He bites his lip the way I always used to, worrying it between his teeth for a few moments, before saying, "Mom. We should probably start to get ready to go up to Grandpa's place." I nod, "Alright honey. Can you get Trent and Charlie up for me?" My life was still blessed. Sam still called the shots, even from jail, and even if he didn't, my sons are Brady's nephews by blood, they're Pack children by birthright, and we'd have been well taken care of regardless. I set my youngest on the floor, swatting his behind lightly, "Go on, get yourself ready to go up to your Grandpa's cabin, okay Johnny?" He nods, "okay." He runs out the door and down the hall into the room he shares with his brother Charlie. Turning, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror; a thirty-six year old woman, with 4 children, and a husband in jail. My hair isn't too grey, my skin is still mostly smooth, only a few worry lines to give away my age, and even after having 4 boys I'm still fit, and mostly firm, though I have to work at it now, unlike when I was younger. Still, apparently I'm a catch, the single dads at my sons' schools always stare when I enter a room, but I still wear my wedding rings, not a day has gone by without them on my finger, and without him on my mind. I sigh again, speaking aloud to my reflection, "Another Christmas to get through without him. Maybe next year things will be different." **Sam POV** I take down the picture from the slat of the top bunk, the most recent picture of Bell and my boys, fingering the edges of it gently, I let myself say aloud, "You don't know it yet, but I'm coming home baby." The sun is barely peeking through the cloud cover, Paul sits on his bunk in the cell across from mine, he asks quietly, "Are you ready?" I nod, "You?" A grin splits his face, "Oh yeahâ€¦ I can't fuckin wait to see my girl, see my kid. And I know that you can't wait to have some private time with Bella. At least I got some conjugals in the last 6 years." I roll my eyes at him, "Yeah, I guess you were just lucky that you only had one kid at home for your girl to worry about." He looks at me with sympathy, "I know it's been rough for you Sam. Only getting to see your boys once a month each, missing Johnny's whole life to date, never being able to touch them except for the hugs and kisses at the beginning and end of each visit. It's been rough for me too, but not as rough as it was for you. Have you thought about it? What you're going to do about the club once we're out?" Ah, the club. If I'm honest the Pack has been at the back of my priorities list for the last 6 years, Brady was running it in my absence, and really, I'm not sure that I want to go back to it. Brady had also kept Uley Construction going, he had made sure that my wife, and my boys were taken care of while I was stuck in this cage. Taking a deep breath, I look at Paul, and answer, "Honestly, I think I'm done with that life, Brother. I've missed 6 years of my kids' lives. Sam Jr. was 8 when I came in here, Trent was 7, Little Charlie was only 5, and Bella had just found out the week before that she was pregnant with Johnny. Now all of my boys but Johnny are in double digits, I know that the guys and Charlie have been teaching them how to be men, but that's MY job! I want to be there for them, I don't want to miss anymore. My time with The Pack, I think it's over, Brother. I do not want to miss any more of my kids' lives for that." Paul looks like he wants to say something, but before he does the guards come for us, "Uley, Dixon! Lets go!" I put the picture in my pocket as we wait for the doors of our cells to open, stepping forward we hold our hands out, and the guards put the shackles on us for the last time. We follow him through the halls down into the sub-basement where they give you your outgoing physical, a little psychological workup, and finally give you back your personal effects and let you go out the door and up the stairs to the release area. Another guard comes in and they take Paul and I into separate examination rooms. The door closes and I sit on the exam table, waiting for the doctor to come in. The guard is a nice one, he smiles and makes chit chat, "So you and Dixon are out today? You looking forward to a family Christmas?" I smile, "Hell yeah I am. My wife and kids don't even know that I'm coming, my brother and my father in law are putting it all together." He nods, "That sounds real nice for them, and for you. Your wife had a baby while you were in here didn't she?" I answer, "Yeah, she had just found out she was pregnant the week before I got arrested." He's about to say something when the doctor comes in, blonde, too pretty for a place like this. She reads the chart aloud as she walks in, "Samuel Uley, age 44, height 6'5, weight 250, being released today?" I nod as she looks up at me, "Yes ma'am" She smiles, "congratulations, I'm honestly just going to do a quick once over on you, make sure you don't have lice, and then send you on your way." I nod, and she asks, "Do you have any medical complaints?" Shaking my head, I answer, "Nope. I haven't been in an altercation in 4 years, people pretty much just let me be, and I do the same for them." She nods, "I guess people would give the guy who popped another guys eye like a grape a wide berth." I shrug, and she comes to my side, "Lean down please, I need to see your scalp." I do as asked, and feel the teeth of a comb running over my scalp as she checks me for parasites. Finally she stops, "Okay, well you don't seem to have anything wrong with you physically. How do you feel about release? Are you anxious at all about returning to society?" While she was talking she's taken a few steps back, and she concentrates on my face as I answer, "I'm excited about my release, and I'm anxious to get back to society. I'm not unsure or scared, I have no intention of going back to the things that got me in here in the first place. All I want in the world is to kiss my wife, hug my sons, and return to my legitimate business. It's Christmas Eve, and I'm going home. I'm very, very happy." The doc smiles, "Good for you Uley, I hope you keep that mentality." She turns to the guard, "I'm done with him, you can take him out." She leaves the room first, and I follow the guard out and down the hall into a room where a female guard waits with the package of my effects. The guard takes my shackles off and leaves back down the hall as the guard behind the counter says, "Sign please." I sign the form on the package and she tears it open, emptying out the clothes I came in wearing, and my sneakers, along with my rings. The first item I pick up is my wedding ring, I look at it, reading the engraving on the inside, ' Love that lasts forever, SB 07/10/13' I can feel the tears stinging my eyes, as I slip the ring on my left ring finger, shaking it off I take a breath and let it out, regaining my composure. The guard speaks again, "All accounted for. I'll step out so you can change." She leaves the cage, I know I'm on camera as I strip down and hurriedly pull my clothes on, dark jeans and a white tee shirt, slipping on my sneakers I fold the jail clothes neatly and leave them on the counter. The outtake guard comes back into the cage and takes them, smiling lightly as she says, "Good luck." The door at the end of the hall buzzes and I go through it meeting a guard who walks up with me to the release area where Paul already waits. He grins and we embrace patting each other on the back and enjoying the feel of freedom already. Paul's wife and his daughter come into the room, his daughter yells, "Daddy!", and runs into his arms. Paul scoops her up, hugging her tight and covering her face with light kisses, "Baby girl! It's so good to hold you like this!" His wife stays a little to the side letting
