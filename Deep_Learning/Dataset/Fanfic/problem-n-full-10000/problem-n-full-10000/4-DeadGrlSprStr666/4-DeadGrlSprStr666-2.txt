You have been warned! A/N: I've been working on this story for a while now, it was originally supposed to be a one shot, but I think it'll be quicker to do it as maybe a 5-10 chapter story. So, here's the first one. **Day 7** It was hot, too fucking hot. The kind of hot that made you sticky and slick just turning over on the couch, the kind of hot that made even the lightest of cotton stick like glue to your skin. Washington state hadn't known this kind of hot in years…decades almost. Hot, gorgeous, sunny… too bad Paul was in Hell. Paul Dixon knew it was a bad idea to go on the joint field trip that La Push and Forks High had decided to do for the senior and junior classes, but most of his friends, and most of all his girlfriend, had wanted to go. So he had decided to suck it up and go, and if he lived through this, he would never doubt his intuition ever again… ** 3 weeks prior** Paul's girlfriend Bella Swan sits in his lap on the couch in his living room, she strokes his cheek, as she implores, "C'mon Babe! I don't want to go if you're not going, and I have to go because Dad already agreed to be one of the chaperones!" Paul rolls his eyes, "That's not my fault! I really don't want to go Baby. I mean c'mon yourself, it's not like we're going to be able to do anything debaucherous, we probably won't even get a minute to ourselves the entire time we're there! Can't you just fake sick the day they're supposed to leave?" Bella pouted, and Paul knew he was gonna cave. He couldn't resist that pout(and Bella knew this), and even more so when she ran her hands through his thick black hair, and intoned, "Pleeease Babe? I promise I'll figure out how to get my dad out of the way so we can sneak in a quickie..." Paul laughed, deep and booming, "Alright, alright. You'd better make good on your promise babe." Smiling slyly, she rubs her hands over his muscular chest, "Don't I always?" He tangles his hands in her long brown-red hair and pulls her in for a deep kiss, mumbling, "mhm" against her mouth. **One Week Later** Bella and Paul met outside Forks High School, their fathers made polite small talk, as they followed their children into the school. Charlie had never truly warmed up to Paul, he had always hoped that Bella would get tired of the bad boy and end up with his best friend Billy's son Jacob. Unfortunately for him though, Bella had never seen Jake as anything more than a friend and brother figure. Paul Dixon Sr. though had always adored Bella, and he was hoping more than anything that the two stayed together. Bella had a calming effect on Paul Jr., and Sr. was hoping that she could talk Paul into being the first Dixon to go to college. The group made its way to the cafeteria, the senior and junior classes of Forks and La Push were meeting there to talk about the trip, get everything squared away as far as groups, and bus assignments went. Bella, Paul, and their fathers took a seat at the table with Sue and Harry Clearwater, their daughter Leah, and Allison Uley and her son Sam who is Leah's boyfriend. Sam and Paul had been best friends since kindergarten along with Jared Tompkins, and Leah had grown up with Bella, the two were practically sisters. Especially with how much help Sue and Harry had given Charlie with her after Renee ran off with a gym teacher from San Francisco. Everyone chit chatted while the rest of their classmates who were interested in going on the trip, and their parents, made their way in and sat down. Principal Greene, the principal of Forks High school came in, and took a microphone while Dr. Terrence the principal of LPH sat to the side, "Okay folks, I think everyone who gave permission slips is here now, and if not, they just won't have a choice what group they're in." He takes a drink of water, and continues, "Obviously we're not all going to be able to go to the same campground. The school has gone to a great amount of trouble to set this end of the year treat up for you, and we expect everyone to be on their absolute best behavior! That means no drinking, NO musical sleeping bags, no fires outside of designated fire pits, and absolutely no drugs !" Of course a raucous student has to shout from the back, "WHY EVEN GO THEN?" Principal Greene scowls, then snaps, "You won't be going if you keep that up Mr. Newton!" He takes a calming breath, and goes on, "Now, Group A will be in the site farthest away, that site is a good half a days drive from anything else, and while it is the only site with a lake rather than a river, it does not have a radio. Therefore Chief Swan's group will be the one taking that site. Groups are going to consists of 20 people maximum! This must include at least 2 adults, one of whom must be a faculty member of either Forks or La Push High School!" Charlie Swan picks up the roster sheet, and starts filling in names, Group A consists of Bella, Charlie himself, Paul, Sam, Leah, her mother who is fulfilling the faculty requirement since she's the school nurse in LPH, Billy who has a van, his son Jake, Jake's best friends Quil Ateara and Embry Call, Jared and his girlfriend Kim Connors, and also Bella's friends Angela Webber and her boyfriend Ben Cheney, Bens best friend Tyler Crowley and his girlfriend Jessica Stanley, Jessica's best friend Lauren Mallory, her on/off boyfriend Mike Newton along with his father, and Angela's father who is the preacher in Forks Methodist Church for a total of 20. He hands the sheet back up to Principal Greene, who tells them, "Okay, Group A unfortunately the bus company wouldn't provide transportation to that particular campground, so you're on your own to get up there. A Park Ranger will meet you up there at 8 am on Saturday morning, and he'll be back to check on things before you leave the following Saturday night. Chief Swan, these people's lives, as always, are in your hands." Charlie nods, "Everything will be fine." **Another week later; Leaving Day** Group A met in the Forks High School parking lot at 8 pm on Friday night. The day had been spent preparing for this drive. Coolers had been packed, snack food purchased in abundance, non-alcoholic beverages only of course. Bella checked the hidden compartment in her backpack discretely, she had an ounce of bud packed into a plastic bag inside another bag filled with coffee grounds, and a bowl along with several lighters in the compartment, and she couldn't wait to commune with nature. Paul couldn't wait either, he was planning on getting Bella to sneak out into the lake for some skinny dipping. He had brought a big bottle of sleeping pills and fully intended on slipping Charlie a few one night. Sam and Leah were driving up with Jared and Kim, while Bella and Paul were riding with Charlie, and also Leah's mom Sue. Billy was taking Jake, Quil, and Embry, Angela and Ben were riding with her Dad, Lauren and Mike with his dad, and Tyler since he and Jess were in the middle of an argument had decided that he would ride with Ben while Jess stayed with Lauren and Mike. Everyone settled into their assigned cars, Charlie gave the signal and pulled out in front of the caravan. He was used to being lead car, and everyone naturally fell in line behind him. Bella reaches out for Paul's hand, as she asks, "Dad, why are we leaving so early?" He catches her eye in the rearview, "Bella didn't you pay attention at the meeting? Our campsite is a 5 hour drive past the rest of them, it's the most beautiful, but it is the most remote too. Which is why we have 5 adults as opposed to the 2 apiece the other groups have, it's also why we have a police officer, a nurse, and Mr. Newton who knows all there is to know about camping and outdoors safety. If anyone gets injured while we're up there it's a pretty far drive to get them to help. So we're leaving now because the state park is 5 hours away, then it's 2 hours to the edge of the last closest campsite before ours, and then another 5 hours to our campground." Bella sits back for 20 minutes, and then shudders before exclaiming, "You're going to drive the whole way!" Charlie shakes his head, "No, of course not. Sue will take over driving for me in about 5 hours, that'll give her time to sleep some, and then we'll switch again. Jake is going to take over for Billy, I believe Angela will drive some, and Mike as well." Bella nods, "Oh. Okay." Sue opens her eyes, "Does anyone know what the weather is supposed to be like?" Charlie nods, "We're supposed to get a heat wave, nothing too major. At least it means we can enjoy the lake!" **About 90 minutes later** Bella moves into the middle of the bench seat in the back of Charlie's old station wagon, and straps herself in, leaning against Paul who puts his arm around her as she closes her eyes. He avoids the glare Charlie is giving him, choosing to close his eyes and sleep himself. **Around 1:30am** Paul and Bella wake as Charlie pulls to a stop in the parking lot of a rest area. Sue stretches and yawns, "Hoooo that was a long ride. You kids better go to the bathroom now, there's no other rest stations till we get to the park." The rest of the cars pull in around them, everyone gets out either just to stretch, or to make use of the facilities, though some are clearly already keen to get in trouble, Mr. Newton's voice calls out, "Michael! The men's room is on the other side!" Mike rolls his eyes at his father, who for too long has treated his son like a buddy and is now ruing those choices and their consequences, as Mike says, "Thanks a lot cock-block!" Mr. Newton takes a deep breath, chanting to himself lowly, "Must not kill the boy…must not kill the boy…" Slowly everyone makes their way back to the vehicles, drinks are pulled from coolers, Bella hands her father, Sue, and Paul each a foil wrapped sandwich, "It's almond butter. Sue, I know you're allergic to peanuts." Sue smiles as she takes the sandwich "thank you sweetheart." Bella nods, "You're welcome!" Paul and Bella take their sandwiches over to a picnic table, and they sit down, Bella asks, "So on a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you hate me for making you come?" Paul shakes his head, "I could never hate you Baby! I love you, but I want you to think about all the nasty, dirty , sexy things we could be doing to each other right now if we had stayed home like I wanted." Bella smirks, her flirty smile accompanied by an arch of her brow as she says, "I'm sure we'll be able to
