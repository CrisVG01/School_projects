A/N: Hey! So, here's chapter one of a romance novel in email-format that I might expand. Depending on how many reviews / PMs I get asking for a second chapter, I might continue. Note: As this story is in email format, I had to edit all of the emails to show on FanFic. Disclaimer: Nah, I don't own Riordan's stuff. Rating: T (language, strong themes) To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Piper McLean [ piper . mclean { a t } ARweekly . net ] Re: Last Night What HAPPENED last night? I mean, really. One minute, I was just by the chips and guacamole table, hoping to hide from the hordes of size-0 supermodels crowding the area, and then: BOOM! Tables are being upended, and Luke Castellan gets slapped in the face. Not that I don't applaud you. To the contrary, actually. Castellan deserved a smack in the face. But I mean… at Beauregard's engagement party? You couldn't have waited a few hours? I know that you're one for drama, but… what HAPPENED? I know something happened. Castellan's been whiny all day. He snapped at Brunner… you should have seen his face. It was priceless. Really. You missed out, girl. Forget about ACTUALLY smacking him in the face (as you seem to be overfond of doing), you should have seen Brunner's smackdown. It all started with the classical crud Castellan was blasting in his cubicle. He was all like, "Castellan, what on earth are you doing? Did we ask to hear that mopey violin music?" Castellan: "It's not mopey or violin; it's Yo-Yo Ma. It's art. You would know that were you to actually interest yourself in art outside the Chrysler Building." Brunner: *choice words that I'd rather not write here; seeing as how this account is technically sponsored by Architect Weekly Magazine* "I don't care if it's art or not. It's annoying. Turn it off and get me the paper on the Grateful Dead house in San Francisco, you moron." Castellan: "The Grateful Dead don't make art, though." Brunner: "I beg to differ. Jerry Garcia definitely makes art. Now, go and get back to work before I send you out of here with your tail between your legs. Nobody cares about your wangst or your cruddy art music. They do, however, care about the house of one of the greatest Psychedelic-Improvisation musical groups of the twentieth century. So get writing." Castellan: *inaudible* Brunner: "Did you just say something? Because if you did, my response would be to tell you that you are a useless womanizer and you wouldn't have to be so whiny if you did your work instead of occupying the one-person bathroom stalls with two. Got it?" Castellan: *silent* Office: *laughs* Brunner: *yells* And so, really, you missed a priceless gem. Anyway, are you planning on coming into work at all? Because it's 10:30, and you're officially an hour and a half late. Just thought I should let you know. So: WHAT HAPPENED? As your best friend, I think I have a right to know. Just a thought. -Pipes ;) To: Annabeth Chase [ annabeth . chase { a t } ARweekly . net ] From: Chiron Brunner [ chiron . brunner { a t } ARweekly. net ] Re: Your apparent absence Where are you, Chase? The rules in this office are VERY clear: notify the office 12-72 hours before hand if you are going to be missing work. You have failed to do so, and, as a result, you are just three hours tardy. Which, as you well know, the Human Resources Department doesn't like. If you do not reply to this email within the next hour, I will be forced to: -tell the Human Resources cronies to mark an unaccounted absence, thus taking away a vacation day -yell at you when you return; this magazine is not a traveling circus caravan; it's a workplace, the least you can do is show up to work on time -yell at you once again because the rumor mill says that you physically apprehended Luke Castellan (which, clearly, is not an issue. I cheer you on that point. The issue is more that you are not showing up to work and therefore ruining your brave facade. Pull it together, Chase.) Please don't force me to do any of these. Also: I need that article on Kim Kardashian's house by 5:00, or I'll be forced to REALLY yell. And we all know that's never good.

Really: are you stupid? You ruined my engagement party! I mean, for Chrissakes! You upended a table, slapped Luke Castellan, inadvertently injured Leo Valdez from Programming, and ruined half of the caterer's food. Were you dropped on your head as an infant? I swear to God, I'm not usually an irrational person, but… I mean, COME ON, Annabeth. You ruined the engagement party. Beckendorf's father paid, like, more than my actual salary for that party. Do you know how furious he is? He won't pay for any of the wedding! Do you realize this disaster? ANNABETH, I COME FROM A FARM IN THE MIDDLE OF MINNESOTA. MY FAMILY'S INCOME IS BASED OFF OF CHEESE AND FISH. AND HALF OF IT IS SPENT ON VIKINGS T-SHIRTS. Not to mention I'm broke. I've already had to deal with a bunch of this wedding planning. I was counting on the Beckendorfs to chip in. So, really: are you going to pay for my wedding? Or will I be forced to throw myself across the nearest object a-la-Disney Princess?

Are you okay? I just… I don't know. I wasn't in the room at the time, but there's a rumor going around that you slapped Lucas in the face. If you did, that's alright; I'm sure you had your reasons. But… Are you really OK? I don't know Lucas personally, but I've heard all sorts of nasty rumors about them. Bad rumors. I just… I don't know. Maybe I'm just crazy. But you're not at work today, and I thought, well, it couldn't hurt to send her a little message, now could it? You're probably just sick, and I'm probably just silly, but, all the same, let me know if you need any help. I'm always here. After all, that's what Human Resources reps are supposed to do, right? Love, Hazel Levesque Human Resources Architecture Weekly Magazine P.S.- I'm trying to protect you, but Drew Tanaka - you know, my boss? Head of HR? - is circling your desk like a blood-hungry shark. You might be getting a write-up. Just thought you should know.

The rumor mill is, like, exploding. I'm not sure if I can even handle it anymore. Especially, with, you know. Cancer and all that. That's the other reason I'm emailing you: I just thought you should know that I'm expected to have to move to the cancer wing within the next few weeks due to the fact that my chemo is going to be intensifying. So I'll probably have to terminate my working here at Architecture Weekly. Which is a shame… So many nice people here (even excluding Castellan). But I will get a severance packet, so, hey! Looking on the bright side! Ugh. Who am I kidding? But let's stay on the bright side, yeah? No cancer! I want dirt!

YOU PUT A TABLE IN MY FREAKING FACE. IN MY FACE, CHASE. IGNORE THE FACT THAT LAST SENTENCE RHYMED… SORT OF. ANYWAY, JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS: YOU PUT A TABLE IN MY FACE. MY DELICATE LATINO COMPLEXION CANNOT HANDLE THESE SORTS OF PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE AFOREMENTIONED INCIDENT CAUSED ME TO HAVE: A BLACK EYE A SPRAINED WRIST TWO AND A HALF TEETH MISSING THIS IS A VERY UNPLEASANT THING. ALSO, I WILL NEED SOME MONEY TO GET THE DENTAL BILL BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT, THE GUYS FROM PROGRAMMING MAKE NO MONEY. A TRAVESTY, BUT REALITY. POOR SILENA AND BECKEN-WHATSITS. TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING OUT OF NOTHING. IT MAKES ME SICK INSIDE. (AND ALSO KIND OF HAPPY. HEY, I HAVEN'T FOUND A GIRL WHO HASN'T RUN SCREAMING YET, AND BECKENDORF MANAGES TO FIND THE MODEL WHO POSES FOR THE COVER OF ARCHITECTURE WEEKLY? WHAT IS THAT JUSTICE? IT'S NOT JUSTICE. THAT'S JUST THE PLAIN OLD TRUTH.) BUT, ANYWAY, I DIGRESS. I'M STILL GOING TO KILL YOU. ALSO, I HAVEN'T QUITE DECIDED WHETHER OR NOT THIS THREAT IS FOR REAL, OR JUST A JOKE. SO YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.

Something about "Promising journalist going off the face of the Earth." So I would prepare a speech when/if you come into work tomorrow. Something along the lines of "I got ebola, and I wouldn't want to infect you, Mr. D, owner of our fair magazine, so I decided to stay at home and wait to get better. You know, after the bleeding-out-of-the-eyeballs phase has passed." Just a thought. Hey, don't shoot the messenger! (Because you know I'll shoot you back. I've got a crossbow in my pantry. Along with several guns. You never know). Clarisse Rodriguez Assistant to Mr. Bacchus E. Dionysus Architecture Weekly Magazine P.S.- I heard Valdez has got it out for you. He looks even worse than usual- his face looks like a smashed-up blueberry Pop-Tart. What did you DO last night? And what HAPPENED? And why aren't you in work? I mean, it's 4:30 (pm) ! But, anyway. If you need muscle to pound Valdez, just let me know. I'm trained in several martial arts, including jujitsu, karate, kung fu, tae kwon do, and krav maga. (Though, who has ever heard of krav maga, is what I would like to know.) So, yeah. Aside from being Mr. D's coffee girl, I am also a muscle for hire.

I mean, you said that I could tell you ANYTHING. So, what? That excludes what, exactly? What did I say to make you, oh, I don't know, throw a table in my face? I'd really like to know.
