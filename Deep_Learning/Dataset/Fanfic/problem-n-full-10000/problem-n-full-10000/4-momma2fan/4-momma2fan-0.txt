Summary: Bella thought Edward had cheated on her and left him. Edward claimed it was all a misunderstanding. Can one night, a year later, help the truth come out? Watch as they learn it's not always easy to be apart. Rated 'M' for language and future lemons. Disclaimer: I do not own these characters..I just wish I did. Inspired by the song Easy by Rascal Flatts w/ Natasha Bedingfield Easy "Bella, It's been a fucking year! Don't you think you've avoided him long enough?" Alice screamed at me. "Now get your ass in the bathroom and get in the shower. I will be waiting out here with your outfit, and then I will do your hair and makeup." I made no comments or complaints and headed for the shower. I set the temperature to as hot as I could stand it. I let the water pulse away the tension in my neck and shoulders. It did nothing for the fear in my chest. Tonight was Alice's engagement party and my ex was going to be there. My ex also happened to be her brother and the best man. I hadn't seen or spoken to Edward since that fateful night when I walked into the house we shared and found him in bed with his high school girlfriend. He claimed nothing happened, but I know what I saw. Kate had been trying to get back with him for years and I knew it wasn't innocent. I didn't stick around to hear his explanation. I made sure he wasn't home when I went to pack up my stuff. I remember crying for months. I had thought Edward was my future. I saw our children and our life together slip away in that one moment. I stepped out of the shower and toweled off. I looked at the bra and panty set Alice had left out and cringed. What is she thinking? Before I couldn't even question it, I stepped into the blue lace boy shorts and matching strapless bra. I ran a comb through my wet hair and walked out to my bedroom. "Finally. You know I have to get ready to." Alice complained. "Give it a rest, Ali. You have been bitching at me since you got here." I sat down in the chair in front of her and shut my eyes. "Bella, I'm sorry if this is going to be hard for you. Would it help if I tell you that he is coming alone?" "No." I left it at that and tried to forget about where I was going and whom I would be seeing. An hour later, Alice moved away from me. I stood up and let her help me into my cerulean blue dress. It was strapless and cinched at the waist, but flared out over my hips and stopped just above the knee. It was fun and flirty and I had been anxious to wear it ever since I saw it in Saks. When I was zipped and Alice was satisfied with my appearance, she turned me so I could take in my reflection from the floor mirror in my room. She had curled my hair and swept it over one shoulder, pinning it with some blue butterfly combs. I had a smokey eye and glossy lips with just a hint of color. "Wow. Thanks, Ali." "You look fabulous, Bells. I'm going to go get ready. Let me know when the limo gets here. And don't sit." She bounced off the shower and I went into the living room to make sure that I had everything I would need in my clutch. I looked out the big picture window and thought back to the day the she had called me to tell me that she was engaged. "Bella! Jasper proposed tonight. Can you believe it? I'm getting married." I could almost hear her bouncing through the phone. "Oh, Ali. I am so happy for you. Tell me everything." And she did. I was on the phone with her for two hours getting the play by play. He had taken her to a french restaurant and had the maitre'd place her ring in the bottom of her champagne glass. It was almost funny. Alice usually chugs her alcohol, but something made her sip this. When she saw the ring coming toward her, she had dropped her flute. It was almost laughable, but not quite. When she had looked up from the broken shards, Jasper was on one knee in front of her and the whole restaurant had gotten quiet. Until she squealed yes, that is. "Bella. You have to be my maid-of-honor. Please say you will?" Alice begged. I didn't even think before I said, "Of course. I would love to." Me and my big mouth. It was too late to turn back now, I would just have to grin and bear it. I would walk into the party and avoid him. I would make him think it was easy for me to live without him. ***EASY*** I stepped out of the shower and toweled off. I wiped down the mirror and began my morning ritual, too bad it was evening. I shaved and tried to do something with my unruly hair, but as usual it went into its normal, just out of bed, sex hair, look. I gave up and went into the bedroom, pulling on my suit. Alice had made sure to tell me exactly what I would be wearing and even sent over a blue silk tie. I had been preparing myself for this night ever since Jasper had told me he was going to propose. I knew Alice would ask Bella to be her maid-of-honor. I hadn't seen her since she had walked out of my life a year ago. Fucking Kate! She had walked into our house and seen me in our bed with an old girlfriend and completely misread the situation. I had just gotten home from a long shift at the hospital and had crawled into bed, knowing Bella would be home in about an hour. I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I knew, I felt warm arms slide around me. I rolled over prepared to kiss Bella hello, but came face to face with my ex, Kate Denali. "What the fuck are you doing here? Get out!" "Come now, Eddie. Is that anyway to say hello?" She had purred. My first mistake had been staying that bed. "What do you want Kate? You need to get out. Bella will be home soon." "Are you still playing house with the mouse?" She laughed at her pathetic attempt at levity. Before I had been able to say a word, a noise from the doorway caught my attention. Bella stood stock still staring at me with tears pouring down her face. I held my hand out in a stopping gesture, "NO! Bella this isn't..." I never got to finish because she had spun around and ran away. I heard the front door slam, before I could get to her. "FUCK!" "Well, now we can play." I felt Kate's hand slide up my arm. I turned and gripped her arm roughly. "Get your clothes and get the fuck out of my house. I never want to see you again. You just possibly ruined my life you fucking bitch!" I had called Bella all night, but it just went to voicemail. I left messages that were never returned. Alice told me she didn't want to see me and that I should give her some space. So I did, worst mistake I ever made. A week after the incident, I came home and found all of her stuff had been cleaned out and she had changed her number. I never saw her again. I also never got over her either. Bella was the love of my life. Tonight would be difficult for me. I was going to find out how she found it so easy to walk away from me. Tonight, I would make her talk to me. ***EASY*** "Alice! The limo just pulled up." I hollered. "Coming!" Alice answered back. Alice walked out of the bedroom hopping as she adjusted the straps of one of her heels. She was stunning in her white one shoulder dress. She looked like a bride. "Ali, you look fantastic." "Thanks, Bells. Here are your shoes. Let's go." Alice handed me a pair of three inch heels in the exact color of my dress. I slipped them on, surprised that they were actually comfortable. I followed Alice out to the waiting limo and slid in after her, I knew she wanted to make sure I entered the club before her. Jasper was part owner of one of the hottest clubs in Houston. His twin sister, Rosalie, was a majority owner and handled the day to day operations. They had closed the club for the private party this evening. I had only been here a couple of times, avoiding places where I knew Edward could be. Alice said he had been working himself to death and had taken a month's vacation to help Jasper. I bet he would never have done that for me. "A toast! To the future Mrs. Jasper Whitlock. May happiness follow you always." I toasted with the champagne Alice had handed me. "Thanks, Bells. I know tonight isn't going to be easy, but try and have fun, okay?" "Sure." I looked out the window as the lights of Houston rolled by. I would enjoy myself, it just wouldn't be easy. The limo pulled to a stop outside an old warehouse, turned nightclub. Eclipse was written in pink neon across the facade. The driver opened the door and I slid out, waiting for Alice to join me. "We're late, Ali." "I know, I wanted to make an entrance." She grinned. Great! I just followed after her and waited while she knocked on the door. The outside doors had no handles, so they could only be opened from the inside. One of the bouncers, Jake, opened the door and let us in. "Well, here comes the bride. I'll let the DJ know you're here. Just wait a minute." Jake let the door shut and then slipped into the bar, leaving us standing in the entryway. "Alice, what's going on?" I questioned. "Just making an entrance." And making sure my brother sees you first thing . Alice just smiled over at me. "Smile, Bella." I smiled and then frowned when I heard the DJ's voice. "Ladies and gentleman, please turn your attention to the doors as the bride and maid-of-honor have arrived. Please welcome, Bella Swan and Alice Cullen." The doors in front of us were swept open and cheers and applause went up around the room. Oh, yeah, this was going to be easy. ***EASY*** My eyes and been trained on the door for the last half hour. Every time someone would come through those doors, I looked to see if it was her. "Relax, dude. Alice has something planned, so you'll know when she gets here. You need to calm down, Edward." Jasper said, as he nursed his beer. "Easy for you to say, Jaz, you got your girl. I haven't seen Bella in a year, man." I took a large swallow from my own beer and looked at my watch for the hundredth time. I looked up when I saw the bouncer approach the DJ. I waited until he walked back to the door and knew she was here. "Ladies and gentleman, please turn your attention to the doors as the bride and maid-of-honor have arrived. Please welcome Bella Swan..." I didn't hear him announce my sister, I was staring at the brown-eyed beauty at her side. Bella had changed little in a year, she was more beautiful than I remembered. I felt a stirring in my crotch as my eyes raked up and down her body. Her dress fit her in all
