okay I know most of you are probably going seriously Ghost this is the fifteenth time you've added a new story well sorry but this was too good also I had the long since ready to post I just didn't realise I hadn't posted it hehe oops Chapter 1. Harry's new home Vernon Dursley's was in his car driving down a dirt road he was going quickly over the speed limit and after a moment he ran into a bump and the large fat man ignored the yelp from his trunk while inside said trunk Harry Potter Vernon's nephew was trying his hardest not to hit the sides of the trunk with his bruised and battered body especially his leg you see the Dursley household really didn't like Harry but were kinda forced to keep the 7 year old around although Harry didn't know who did that heck he didn't even know that they were forced to take him all he cared about at the moment was surviving whatever hell his uncle was currently taking him too. Although with Vernon Dursley all he could think about at the moment was about where he was heading to a place called The Wick woods you see the Dursley's had been on vacation in a town called Pine Creek in America but sadly (for them) they had to bring the freak as they called Harry along with and know Vernon had grown tired of the little freak with his magic especially after he had went into that pub Flashback "Huh where did the freak go daddy" Dudley asked this made both Vernon and Petunia Dursley to look around only to find him in a pub of all places talking to the cashier while he played around with a radio that was on the counter then all of a sudden the radio sparked and started playing the sound of screaming shocking everyone there and quickly Vernon grabbed the Freak in the confusion and dragged him into the car knowing that he had done that and quickly he had drove away knowing that the best place to get rid of him would be the nearby woods Flashback end And now Vernon was parking his car right outside a gate and quickly he reached into the back of his car and moved forward with some steel cutters before he cut the lock off then after pushing the gate open Vernon moved to get his nephew Harry on the other hand had started to freak out the car had stopped and he had just heard something break what was going on then with speed the trunk was opened and Harry was dragged out and tossed in the direction of the gate "Okay Freak we're going to play a game" Vernon said and looking back Harry quickly spotted the oddly shaped bag in his uncle's hands and he already knew what it was "The games simple you run and try to survive while I" Vernon said before pulling the shotgun out of the bag and aiming it at the small child "Shoot at you" Vernon said and before he could pull the trigger Harry had already sprinted off diving and dunking through the foliage and making a lot of noise as he ran into the darkness not knowing of what hid in the woods "Brother someone's here" a little girl's voice said from the trees "Yes I can see that but what" a young boys voice said from another tree's before they heard a shot fired and heard surprisingly a child's whimper "Tim that's a child" another male voice said but this one was almost destroyed by the wind at how silent he was "Come on guys let's see what's going on" the girl's voice said Back with Harry Harry was still running especially after that gun shot and at the moment Harry didn't know where he was all he knew was that he was heading away from the sound of footsteps "Turn right" a voice whispered beside Harry's ear but when he turned to look he didn't spot anyone "Go Right you'll be safe there" another voice whispered and quickly Harry followed their orders thinking that it was just his mind playing tricks but even still maybe and soon enough Harry spotted a small building and quickly he rushed inside and creepily enough the door behind him closed on it's own with a snap With Vernon Vernon could not see a thing it was like a black fog had descended around him and for some strange reason he could swear he heard the sounds of children around him and soon enough he tripped landing in a small pathway and looking around Vernon spotted something and picking it up he realized it was a candle and quickly he lit it only to jump back at the masked kid that was only two inches away from his face with a knife in hand "So you like hurting little kids then hmm" the boy said walking toward Vernon who quickly pulled out his gun and fired at the kid only for the bullets to go right through him and into a tree "Ah ha haa no weapons except ours are permitted in are game" Tim said before lunching at the man screeching with his knife poised to kill and with a yell Vernon Dursley died Back in the Wood Shed Harry didn't know what happened but as soon as the door closed the voices that he had been hearing had stopped and then Vernon's yell had went of into the night this had Harry both relieved and scared mostly because of the fact that he didn't know if Vernon had faked the yell But soon enough Harry watched as the door of the cottage he was in opened then he heard one of the voices again "Follow me" a boy's voice said and slightly reluctantly Harry followed him but had to stop in pain after a few steps and looking down Harry saw that his leg had gotten worse with all of the running it looked like at any moment it would snap and it was after he noticed that when another voice that sounded like a gurgling version of the first come from beside him "Hold up brother his legs hurt follow me for know I know where there's something to fix it up" the gurgling voice said and if it helped his leg Harry followed the voice as after every couple of seconds it spoke again leading Harry under a bridge where there on the ground was a metal leg brace "Go ahead I have no use of it any more besides you need it more" the voice said and nodding Harry moved forward before pulling it on and luckily it fit but just barely but Harry froze when he saw a name on its side "So your name's Tom" Harry said looking up but he didn't hear the voice anymore but soon enough he heard another voice that of a little girls "Well hello there you must be scared here I can help with that" the girl's voice said before Harry heard the sounds of running and quickly Harry followed the sound only for them to stop by a well and there seating on the edge of the barred well was a stuffed rabbit and picking it up Harry had to smile at how the small toy looked then he noticed a name on it "Thank you Lillian I'll be sure to return it to you" Harry said looking around trying to spot the people helping him but he spotted no one and quickly Harry continued on and after a bit of wondering Harry tripped over something and looking down he spotted a dead fire and beside it a small knife and a familiar radio 'Huh guess I still had it in my hand when I was thrown in the trunk' Harry thought before picking up the radio and then he reached down and picked up the knife and smirked "So Tim do you mind if I bring your knife along with me" Harry asked the air but he was surprised when he actually got a reply "Heh as long as you return it to where I am in fact" the voice Harry had heard at first had came back and it seems that this was Tim "How about this we will help you out of here if you get all of are objects and return them to us" Tim said and Harry nodded after all that should be fun as long as Vernon didn't catch him or any wild animal and it was only then that Harry realized why Tim was letting him use his knife and with that in mind Harry followed the unseen person's orders on where to find the items and the first two was actually a mask and a bible, then Harry picked up a Rabbit Skull by a rock and then he found a cross but when he touched this one he heard a roar and almost instantly afterward Harry tried to stop his heart from beating right out of his chest clutching the Cross close "Sorry about that Benny is very tempermental about his cross although that didn't sound like his usual roars that was softer" Tim said this caused Harry to really not want to be on the receiving end of one of Benny's loud roars and after the near scare death attack Harry continued on and found another mask and a bucket then after a bit more of searching Harry came across a trophy and a baby Rattle, then Harry found a Gas mask, a lantern but when Harry found the next item he heard a groan this was one shoe "That would be Caleb's lucky racing shoe's well one of them really I think he has the other one" Tim said then he watch as Harry slipped a bit and fell of the bridge but luckily he had a soft landing in the mud "Hey you okay" a new voice said coming from the ground but Harry couldn't see anything there "Yeah I'm fine had harder fall's" Harry said before he noticed that his left shoe was gone "Heh go ahead and wear my shoe it should keep you from falling again" the voice who must be Caleb said this just caused Harry to shake his head "Okay two things one you guys are way to nice and where the heck are you guys and how are you talking to me" Harry said as he tied the slightly too big shoe "Don't worry you'll get to met us soon the last item is where we are" Lillian's voice said and for some reason Harry shivered wondering if he really wanted to meet these people "So what's your name" the gurgling voice was back and seeing as Harry had already met the other's Harry would have to guess this was in fact Tom "I'm Harry or if you're my last remaining family Freak" Harry said really not caring anymore what the Dursley's called him "WHAT why would a family call you that I mean I know families can be mean but, (Growl) okay know I'm really wishing I was the one to get that, ROAR, okay now I know why I liked you, will all of you be quiet" all of them said at once and this also caused Harry some surprise and some ear pain "Hey don't worry Harry I guess we're in the same boat" Lillian said this caused all of them to go silent "Well not exactly Lillian but he is pretty close" Tom said and once again Tim started giving Harry directions "So you guys Parents are dead and you have to live with a aunt and Uncle that hates you" Harry said "No we don't live with anyone else but ourselves know and as for are Parents being dead we wish our dad
