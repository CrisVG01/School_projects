A/N: I plan on making this story 7 chapters - one per day of the week. This is a continuation of Truth and Consequences, so if you haven't read that, it probably would be best for you to stop and do that before reading this. I'm not sure how long it'll take to post the next chapter, but I promise I'm working on it. Now to the story... ~~**HGPP**~~ Hermione walked into the Great Hall for breakfast Sunday morning and sat down next to Neville. It was still early enough that no one else was sitting near them. "Neville, do you have some time today to talk about further experiments?" asked Hermione after she settled on the bench. "I promised Professor Sprout I would help in the greenhouses today. It will likely take all day, but I should be available after dinner. Would that work for you?" replied Neville. "That would be lovely. We'll find somewhere to talk after dinner then," Hermione finished with a smile. She was a bit excited about the possibilities. As she was about to pull some toast onto her plate, she felt a hand on her thigh. Her head snapped towards Neville, who had a small smile on his face. She returned it before turning back to her plate. A few moments after filling it with the rest of her breakfast meal, she felt his hand trail higher up her thigh, slipping under her skirt. His hand was calloused and semi rough like you would expect of someone who works a lot with their hands. She sighed in pleasure as his hand crept even higher. She opened her legs more and adjusted on the bench to give him better access to anything he wanted to touch and to signal her consent. Just as a finger grazed her knickers, Dean and Seamus plopped down on the bench across the table from Hermione and Neville. Neville started to pull his hand away and Hermione laid her hand on top of his to stop his retreat. "Morning you two! Have a good night?" Dean asked with a good-natured smirk on his face. Seamus perked up a bit despite the early hour with the implication in Dean's question. Hermione quirked her eyebrow in confusion. How could either possibly know when neither was part of the group last night? Neville answered smoothly, "My evening was quite pleasant. How was yours Hermione?" as his fingers slipped under her knickers. "Very enjoyable. Thank you" squeaked Hermione as a finger entered her slit. She coughed and made the excuse of not having spoken yet this morning for her voice. Dean laughed and turned to Seamus to distract him with a Quidditch topic. Neville just smiled at his porridge that he was slowly eating using his other hand. Hermione only had the chance to worry about what Dean knew, and HOW?!, for a couple of moments before Neville's clever hand drove most everything else out of her head as a finger found her clit and applied just the right amount of pressure in alternating circular and strumming patterns. It took almost all she had to take a few small bites of her breakfast and NOT look like she was committing an exhibitionist act in the Great Hall. She was not confident that she was pulling off the nonchalant look she was trying for, but it appeared that no one was paying enough attention to catch on to the fact that Hermione was well on her way to having an orgasm right in front of them. Thank the gods for early Sunday morning meals where so few people attended! Right as she convinced herself that she might be able to get away with this without anyone being the wiser, Neville changed his pattern, collecting some more of her natural lubrication and then tapping her clitoris directly causing her to moan loud enough to catch a couple of people's attention. "What's the matter Hermione? Forgot to do some extra work for a class?" mocked Seamus. "No, forgot to send for a present. I'll have to do it later," replied Hermione, happy she was able to think of another lie so quickly. The years of getting into trouble with the boys seem to be paying off at the moment. She went back to trying to pretend she was eating to deflect attention from herself. She worked on breathing slowly as well to avoid looking like she was panting, like she wanted to under Neville's ministration. How come neither Luna nor Ginny warned her that he was so good with his hands? Had she known, she might have deferred this experience until she could enjoy it to its fullest instead of having to tamper it so no one knew it was happening. Neville just kept strumming away at her clit, driving her ever closer to the edge while he looked like he had all day to do absolutely nothing! Fuck! How is this even fair? But good gods, did she love what he was doing. Yes! Right there! Hermione couldn't hide much anymore. This was happening so very soon! Hermione propped her elbows on the table and buried her face in her hands. She shakily drew a staggered breath in and started to hum. Ginny decided that this was the perfect time to sit down on the other side of Hermione. What kind of best friend does she have that would do that?! "What's the matter Hermione?" inquired Ginny. Hermione didn't even glance at her. She just shifted her hands so that she could hold up a finger to indicate she needed a moment while her face was still covered. She was SO close! Her humming was taking some erratic melodic paths and increasing in volume, although it was still inside the acceptable range. "Are you ok?" demanded Ginny. Hermione gestured the one finger again as Neville added more pressure to her button, throwing her over the cliff of her orgasm. She stopped humming and subsequently also stopped breathing for a few beats. Then she lifted her head, dropped her hands to the table and breathed out a long extended sigh. When she finished she opened her eyes to find several people staring at her. She turned to Ginny and said, "Yes, I'm fine. I needed to block out distractions and humming sometimes help with that." "Since when?" retorted Ginny. Hermione sighed, shrugged and replied, "Since I was a child, but I stopped before coming to Hogwarts. Until this year anyways." Ginny dropped her glare at the implication of her last sentence. "Oh, ok." She replied deflatedly. Hermione felt Neville pull his hand out from underneath her knickers and skirt. From the corner of her eye, she saw him move his hand to his juice glass and wipe a non-existing drop off the side and popped the finger in his mouth, humming in appreciation of the taste. "Well, if you're ok Hermione, I'm going to get to the greenhouses. Have a good day everyone!" said Neville as he got up and prepared to leave. "I am. Thank you Neville," replied Hermione with a smile and a blush. "What was that?" asked Ginny. "Nothing. Just being friendly," replied Hermione. "Uh huh, sure," replied Dean with a smirk. Seriously, what does he know? thought Hermione. But she only raised an eyebrow to him and then turned her attention to the breakfast that had been mostly ignored until now. On her way out of the Great Hall, she caught up to Luna and started to walk with her. After some small pleasantries, Luna said, "Neville has nice hands, don't you think?" Hermione's face flushed. She wasn't sure what Luna knew but the timing was astonishingly embarrassing. She knew from the look on Luna's face that she wouldn't have been able to get away with saying nothing on the manner. "I haven't thought about it until today, but I agree that they are quite nice," replied Hermione. "He's very apt at being both gentle and rough. I suppose it's a natural development from his skills in herbology," she stated airily and appeared to be about to drift off in a different direction. "I suppose. Luna, I would like to ask for your help again," said Hermione as she took a quick look around to see if there was anyone to overhear her request. "Is this about Neville or Pansy?" asked Luna serenely. "Pansy. I was hoping to extend her experiences with a night catered to each of the different houses since I have a whole week to… play with. I have some ideas, but I would like some suggestions from the intended audiences. I thought you might be able to ask the seventh and eight years in Ravenclaw if they're interested and what kind of things they would like to see or do to her. Of course, they have to be approved by both myself and Pansy. Could you do that for me?" asked Hermione. "Of course Hermione. I should be able to get you some of that by tonight if you'd like," replied Luna. "That would be great, Luna!" smiled Hermione. They parted ways and Hermione ran off to catch up to Hannah Abbott to ask her the same favor. ~~**HGPP**~~ Hermione busied herself all morning and most of the early afternoon with rough drafting some ideas for the extracurricular activities for Pansy. She was on her way to the library to research a couple of spells and charms that would fill some gaps in her plans when she was accosted from behind and herded into an abandoned classroom. She whipped around to find Pansy looking all frantic. "Granger, what did you do?! Something you did is interfering with my normal Sunday plans!" Pansy nearly shouted in frustration. Not enjoying the manhandling she just experienced, Hermione was irritated and let it bleed into the tone of her voice. "I haven't seen you since this morning, Parkinson, so how could I have done anything to interrupt your precious plans? It's not like I attacked you in the hallway or anything!" she quipped. "It must have been your stupid spell from last night! It's not supposed to ruin my life!" whined Pansy. Hermione rolled her eyes. "Pansy, were these plans sexual in nature?" asked Hermione will little patience. Pansy blushed. "No!" "Fine, what were you doing and how was it interrupted?" countered Hermione. "I was just relaxing on my bed… reading… and I felt this intense zap. Like someone sent a stinging spell at a very sensitive spot!" finished Pansy hurriedly. "And how did you connect that to me?" asked Hermione suspiciously. She was sure Pansy was leaving important details out. "My choker mark felt hot and sensitive and when I checked it in the mirror, it looked red and irritated," Pansy replied defensively. Hermione looked at the mark on her neck and while it was no longer red, it did still appear a bit pink at the edges. Hermione held up her hand, but paused to ask, "May I?" Pansy glared for a moment, but then puffed, dropped her eyes and nodded. Hermione touched the mark and Pansy sighed. Hermione ran her hand along the side of Pansy's neck, causing Pansy to lean into the touch and nearly purr with appreciation. As she moved her palm away, Pansy tensed a little, but Hermione didn't remove her hand completely. From lifting her palm the little bit, she was able to see that the area she made contact with, the mark was no longer pink. And from Pansy's reaction, she figured that she was able to sooth the irritation brought on by the unknown vow violation by touching the mark, so she brought up her other hand and slowly and softly rubbed both of her hands along the mark until she had touch every bit of it and no pink remained. Pansy was unaware that she was careening under Hermione's touch. Hermione slowly walked her back to one of the desks and sat her
