Welcome to my new story. Don't worry this one is actually already finished so it won't be slowing down my others. They will be updated when I am satisfied there is enough interest still in them. Please review afterwards it does mean I will post the next chapter quicker. I own nothing! Chapter 1 Carlisle looks out over the snow ridden mountains as the sunsets. In his hand is the invitation from the Voltura to a auction. He hated that the vampire royal family saw shape-shifters as pets. Not as mere human boys and protectors of their lands. His family had argued many times as if they should get themselves a play thing. In the end Carlisle was out voted and he was to go try and buy a shifter. Esme walks behind him and hugs his waist kissing his shoulder gently. He couldn't understand why his family were being like this. He had hoped his years of loving would make them understand. Yet it seemed that he was the naive one. As leader of the coven he could have outranked them. However he didn't believe in not respecting them as a family unit. Emmett had been the loudest wishing to get an alpha wolf. He would be harder to train but he would relish the challenge. One would also cost more than the others. Turning to his wife he kissed her lightly on the forehead. After nearly a hundred years of being with Esme he was happy with his lot. She was a good mother to their young ones and provided Carlisle with his needs. "Don't be long Carlisle. We will be in Port Angeles when you return. Your new job starts in a few months. You know how you like to settle first." she pats his chest affectionately. "I will return at once." he assured her. He would be in Italy the following day giving him a few days to check out the shifters that had been captured. They wouldn't be cheap they never were. Why his fellow vampires continued to purchase the creatures he didn't know. The shifters were loyal to their tribes and rather than become a pet they would destroy themselves normally taking one or two vampires with them. Carlisle hoped that his family would respect the boy as a person more than a wild untamed animal. "I should go." Carlisle kissed his wife while saying goodbye to his children. "Bring me a puppy." Alice said as they hugged. "We will see." Carlisle pulled back and smiled at her. By time Carlisle arrived at the castle many vampires were already there. The smell of wet dog was obvious even with the amount of vampires the wolves scent dominated the air. Carlisle went to pay his respect to his former family having decided that he wished to travel and see the world. He never tasted human blood much to the amusement of the rest of the coven he once called family. Aro, Caius and Marcus were sitting on their thrones greeting the visitors. When Carlisle walked in Marcus for the first time showed a hint of interest. No one had expected Carlisle Cullen to attend after all for centuries he had argued the shifters release. "Carlisle my brother welcome." Aro smiled dismissing the other vampires from the throne room. "Brothers." Carlisle inclined his head in acknowledgement. "We had not dared hope of your presence, but we are happy to welcome you." Aro said standing and walking to his friend to embrace. "I am just as shocked as you Aro. My family seem to have me wrapped around their little fingers." he chuckled. "I see you haven't changed your preposterous diet," Caius chided. "That will never change brother." the men shake hands. "Well I shall get one of the guards to show you the creatures." Aro said making to click his fingers. "I shall do it Aro. I wish to catch up with my brother. It has been many decades since we have caught up." Marcus said beside them. No one was more shocked than Aro that Marcus was going to leave the throne room. Since the death of his beloved wife he had not had any interest in anything. He would sit and brood for weeks only stirring to feed when the need was too great. "Very well. We will see you both later." Aro frowned and watched as the two men embraced and kissed one another's cheeks. "Good to see you my friend." Carlisle said kindly. "Come lets go to the creatures of the night." Marcus led the way out of the great room. People bowed as one of their leaders walked past. If they were shocked they never showed it on their faces. "Clear the rooms. Carlisle will have a private viewing." Marcus ordered. The rooms were cleared in a blink of the eye. There were seven nurseries set up each with viewing windows. In each there were between four and seven human children. Each with the scent of shifters. Carlisle gasped so this was how they managed to catch the shifters. They wouldn't change for years. Their scent made it repulsive to vampires. "Why do you allow this brother?" Carlisle asked looking through the window. "They get younger every generation. The buyers want what is considered a bigger chance of accepting them as their masters. It is yet to be seen." Marcus slowly walked to the next window. "They are so young." None of this was what Carlisle was expecting but even at a young age it was obvious who was to be the alpha's. They were the biggest of the shifters. In the third window Marcus stepped forward and pressed his hand against the glass. Carlisle noticed that the man seemed more relaxed. He let his eyes follow his gaze. There in a crib was a baby no more than a few months old. Like the others he was of native American accent. Along with the baby were three other young cubs. They were happily playing with blocks and trucks. When the biggest looked up he bared his teeth and went to the crib blocking Marcus's view. The other two looked up and stared at the two vampires not showing much of an interest. "That one there is very protective of the little one." he sighed stepping back and moving on to the next window. Carlisle didn't move and watched as the eldest boy tiptoed to look into the crib as if trying to make sure the baby was okay. Carlisle looked at the boys once again and smiled at one who waved to him. Waving back the vampire moved away. He stood on a piece of paper and stopped to pick it up. Protect my mate. Carlisle looked at Marcus who was looking at the next window but didn't look interested. Slipping the paper into his pocket they continued their viewings. Once it was done Marcus excused himself saying he had to hunt. Carlisle went back to the viewing rooms and stood in front of the room where Marcus had shown interest. There didn't seem anything remarkable about the small pack of four. "Ahh Carlisle I'm glad I found you. I wish to call upon your services to check the health of the creatures. Our buyers are wanting them to be in good health." Aro said. "Yes, yes of course. I would need to get my medical bag from my room." he smiled. "Very well. I will have the nurse's make them ready." he walked away not looking back. All up there were fifty shifter children that needed checking out. Each and everyone so far were healthy. It was their first contact with an actual vampire and some of the older ones became upset. That was until Carlisle produced a lollipop for them so he could check them over. He tried to warm his hands up as much as possible. But like any doctor his hands would make each of them jump. He had purposely left the small pack to last. When he tapped on the window the human nurse quickly opened the door locking it behind her. There was no way that even a vampire could penetrate the rooms. "Hello." the one that waved at Carlisle earlier said. "Embry don't talk to strangers." the biggest said pulling him away from Carlisle. "But he is pretty. I like pretty things Jacob." "Your such a girl." the boy named Jacob shouted. "I'm not." Embry burst out crying. The nurse went to pick him up and scold Jacob but Carlisle waved her away. The boys were slapping each other and he got to his knees and pulled them apart. "Your mean Jacob. I'm gonna tell my mommy on you." "Our mommies left us you idjit." Jacob burst into tears. "Oh dear." Carlisle chuckled and pulled both boys into his arms and hugged them as gently as possible. Little arms wrapped around his neck while they continued to sob. Standing up their legs automatically wrapped around his waist. If Carlisle had a heart it would be breaking at their bereavement. There was a tug at his pants and he looked down at the other eldest child his big brown puppy eyes welling up with tears. "Are you our new daddy?" Carlisle swallowed and was about to deny it. But in just a few minutes he had fallen in love with the young boys. He was a very wealthy man. In fact he had more wealth than any person on the planet be they dead or alive. He wondered if even he would be able to afford to purchase the boys freedom. Maybe two of them but all four he wasn't so sure of. What would his family say if he turned up with a pack rather than one? "I can try. But there are other mommy's and daddies that would love you just as much as me." he tried to smile. He hated lying to them but he didn't want them to be frightened anymore than they were. It was obvious that they were very close. When he looked down at the boy he was sucking his thumb and twirling his finger into his hair. "So boys you going to tell me your names?" Carlisle asked as he placed the two boys on the floor again their tears gone. "I'm Jacob and this is Embry and that is Quil sucking his thumb like a baby. And that is Seth he is a baby. He doesn't eat food yet. They give him milk." Jacob said. "Well my name is Doctor Cullen but you can call me Carlisle. I am going to give you each a check over to make sure you are nice and healthy. And if you're good I will give you each a lollipop." he said. "I don't want a needle." Quil said going and hiding under a bed. "Me neither." Both Jacob and Embry shouted. The baby finally woke to the noise and started screaming. The nurse went to pick him up and tried to sooth him. The room was soon filled with screaming and shouting and the nurse was trying to get order. "Enough children. I will not be giving you any injections. Now sit down on the floor I am going to check over little Seth first. He will show you that I am not going to hurt you." Carlisle said in a firm but kind way. The boys sat on the floor crossed legged quiet as mice. Carlisle let out a breath and went to take a still screaming Seth off the nurse. The moment he held him in his arms the child quieted to just little hiccups. His big brown eyes looking up the vampire. He was young maybe only four months old. The scent of a shifter hadn't gotten to him yet but obviously with being with the others it was presumed. If he went to the wrong vampire he wouldn't make it a day. Why was
