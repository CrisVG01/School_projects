Chapter 1 Jacob pulled up at his old family home. Nothing had changed in the last five years. Even the paint that was flaking before he left was the same although even shabbier than before. The ramps that once were built for his father remained not that Billy Black was around anymore. His diabetes had taken him cruelly just before Jacob had left with his imprint and her family. Before he had even turned off the engine the door opened and Rachel appeared her husband right behind her, his arm going protectively around her swollen waist. "Jake," Rachel gasped wanting to greet her brother. "Rachel the baby." Quil whispered in her ear. Jacob chuckled. Who knew his best friend would end up imprinting on his older sister. Rachel had often babysat Jacob and Quil along with Embry when they were young. Now she was having Quil's baby. When his friend had first imprinted on his sister he wanted blood. However he soon understood the power of an imprint when he himself imprinted on Renesmee Cullen seven years ago. Even though she was a newborn Jacob loved her more than life itself and would do anything to be part of her life to one day marry her and have children with her. Or so he had thought it hadn't been enough though and as she grew older his feelings of being a big brother hadn't changed and in fact it had gotten to the stage where he despised the girl. Five years ago the Cullen's moved meaning Jacob would leave his family and pack and follow them like a damn puppy. He was treated like a second class citizen even by his former best friend Isabella. The only one who showed the young wolf any form of love and respect was Carlisle and Esme Cullen. They had become somewhat like parents to him. Shaking his head Jacob turned the car off and stepped out. "Hey Rach." he said stepping up to her and hugging her to him. "What are you doing here?" "Can't I come and visit my sister." he said pulling back and looking at his friend. "You know you're always welcome. Come inside." Quil said giving his friend a one arm hug. "You should have called I would have made a big dinner." Rachel said waddling to the kitchen. "I wanted it to be a surprise and I'm fine I grabbed something in Forks before I came." Jacob flopped down on the couch only to stand up and pull a doll from under him. "How is the little tearaway?" Jacob asked placing his niece's doll on the coffee table. "At mom's for the night." Quil said handing Jacob a beer. Tapping glasses they both drank before sitting back and sighing. "So going to tell me why you're really here?" "I need to come home. How many in the pack still phasing?" "Embry, Leah, Seth, Brady and Paul." "Whoa Paul?" "Yeah he is alpha now." Quil chuckled putting the bottle back to his lips. "Why not Leah?" "She didn't want it. Embry and Seth well they aren't leaders and to be honest Paul's a good alpha." "Where's Colin?" "He imprinted on a girl. No actually a woman about two years ago. She moved to Texas and he followed her. Last we heard they were doing just fine." "So none of the others have imprints?" "Nope, now care to tell me why you're here?" "I've come looking for an explanation as to why the imprint broke." "Your imprint with Nessie is gone?" Quil asked surprised. "Yep. Happened a few weeks ago. Although I have feeling it breaking for some time. Thought maybe your grandfather might know if it had happened before." Rachel waddled in and took a seat next to her husband who looked at her adoringly. Their love for one another was still as strong as the day it was forged. At first Jacob thought maybe it just happened over time and the interest of the imprint disappeared. If anything his best friend and sister were stronger now than before he left, which was saying a lot. "Have you got somewhere to stay?" Rachel asked. "I can get a hotel in Forks." "I won't hear of it. You're more than welcome to Jenny's room. We can sort something tomorrow." "Thanks but no thanks sis. I don't think I can fit into her bed and besides pink isn't' really my colour." he chuckled. The door slammed open and in strolled Paul with Seth and Leah behind him. Of course Jacob smelt and heard them coming but Quil nearly jumped out of his skin and pulled his mate towards him. "Fuckers." Quil snarled letting his wife go and got up. Jacob looked at his former pack. Like him none of them had changed. Seth was the first to greet his friend by throwing himself at him tackling him onto the ground. Laughing Jacob pushed him off easily and pulled him up off the floor hugging him to him. One thing hadn't changed for which he was grateful of. Seth was still the happy dude he had left all those years ago. Leah was next to hug her former alpha. Jacob held her close and took in a deep breath of her scent. She always smelt like roses sprinkled with something he could never figure out. "Why you back?" Paul asked making Leah step back to allow him to answer him. "I just need answers. I'm not here to cause trouble." Jacob said not surprised at Paul's questioning. "Idiot." Paul pulled Jacob into his arms and hugged him firmly. "Good to see you Jake." "You too." Jacob admitted squeezing Paul a little harder. "How long you staying?" Seth asked. "As long as it takes to get answers." The door opened again and in walked Brady. Jacob's mouth just about ended up on the floor. Brady was just a cub like Seth when he had left. Walking up to Paul he put his arm around his waist and looked adoringly into his eyes. Paul leaned down and kissed him on the lips, before he got kissed by Leah and Seth,before turning his attention to Jacob. "Hi," Brady said blushing. "You get used to it." Quil chuckled. "Alrighty then." "Where you staying?" Paul asked. "I'll get a hotel in Forks." "No you'll come stay with us." Seth said looking at Paul for confirmation. "Yep there is a spare room. Your more than welcome to stay as long as you need." Paul smiled at him. "Where's Em's?" he turning his attention to the man still securly nestled in his arms. "Waiting at home." Brady said. "Okay well Seth you show him the way. You alright?" Paul looked at Rachel. "I'm fine." she smiled hugging Quil. Paul nodded and led Brady out Leah on his heels. "That your car?" Seth asked. "Yeah a twenty first present from the Cullen's" he said. "Care to tell me what is going on?" "What do you mean?" Seth asked. "Brady and Paul are together? I thought no one else imprinted." "No one has." Seth shrugged. "Come on dinner will be waiting." he said kissing Rachel's cheek and heading out the door after waving to Quil. Jacob looked at his sister and his friend but they just smiled and shook their head. "It will be best if you go find out for yourself. Don't be a stranger. Jenny will be so excited to see her uncle Jake without being on a screen." Rachel pulled out of her mates arms and kissed her brothers cheek. "Sure, sure." Jacob followed Seth out who was busy checking out his car. It was a Dodge Durango pimped up to a V8 engine. It was perfect for Jacob's large frame and had some decent grunt behind it. Of course he still had his trusty VW sitting in the shed, but the Cullen's didn't want anyone in their family to be seeing driving something so old. With great sadness Jacob had left it in La-Push and Rachel used to it to get out and about in. The trip was no more than a few minutes. Jacob was surprised to see a new house built on the rez and it was massive compared to the others. Parking on the gravel driveway Seth jumped out and raced up the steps shouting they were home. Jacob chuckled at the young man's need to act like everyone was human and needed to forewarn them of their arrival. After grabbing his bag from the trunk of the car Jacob ambled inside. The house was open plan and decked out in the latest gadgets a large flat screen television on the wall was on and some music channel was on. "Jake!" Embry said from the bottom step. "Hello stranger." Jacob said smiling at his other best friend. "Paul said you were coming to stay. Let me show you your room." Embry turned and walked up the stairs. The upstairs was just as impressive as the downstairs. There was another set of stairs going up to another level. However Jacob was on the second level at the back of the house which looked over the forest. Opening the door the wolf couldn't hold back the whistle as he looked around the room. If he thought his room at the Cullen's was impressive it had nothing on this and would put Esme's decorating skills to shame. "Bathroom is through there and closet through that door." Embry said going and sitting on the large king size bed. "What is this place?" Jacob said taking a quick look into the bathroom seeing a massive spa bath and double shower. "It's the pack house." he smiled as Jacob threw his bag on the chair and joined him on the bed. "What you all live here? Where did the money come from?" Embry shrugged. "Man it's so great to see you. We've missed you." Embry said taking Jacob's hand in his and squeezing it. "How is Nessie?" "Last I heard she was fine. The imprint broke that is why I'm back to see if I can get any answers. Seems like I've walked into more questions." he said looking around. "Does Paul know?" "I said I will explain everything with everyone together save repeating myself." "Are you going to stay?" "I don't know." Jacob ran his hand over the back of his neck. "It be nice to have you back." "I don't know if I could take orders from Paul." "He's a good alpha." Embry said a blush gracing his cheeks. "Come on dinner is ready." he pulled Jacob up and they were chest to chest. Jake looked down at his friend something deep inside him stirred but he pushed it away. Stepping back he waved his arm gesturing Embry to lead the way downstairs. When they got to the stairs they were met by Paul and Brady who were both flushed and reeked of sex. Winking Paul let the others go down first but held Jacob back by the arm. "Things are a little different around here Black. You play by my rules or your out." he said so quietly that even this close to him Jacob hardly heard it. A shiver ran down his spine and he nodded. "Good as long as we are clear on that." Paul said letting his arm go and went down the stairs. The pack were standing at the table behind chairs. Seth pointed out a chair beside him for Jacob. No one moved until Paul sat down. The others scrambled into their seats and sat their waiting for something. Paul ducked his head and the others followed suit. After saying grace everyone dived at the food. No one said a word as they filled their plates up. Who ever had cooked had gone all out. Jacob's mouth watered and he couldn't wait to dig in. However when he went to pick up his fork Seth snatched it off him and put it
