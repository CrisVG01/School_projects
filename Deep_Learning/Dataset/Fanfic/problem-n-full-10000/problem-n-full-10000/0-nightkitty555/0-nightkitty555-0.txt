Disclaimer: I clearly own nothing to do with Harry Potter. I challenge you to reread the Diagon/Knockturn Alley scenes in HBP thinking that Draco has a werewolf bite on his arm, not the Dark Mark. Beast Sitting before Hermione was the last person she had expected to see in her small office in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, Beast Division. She was new to the department and still working on changing all the names. "Control" was the most offensive one, she thought. "Creature" was almost as bad, and "Beast." Draco Malfoy. She'd known he was a werewolf, of course, because it had come out very publicly in his trial and those of his parents. His bite had been punishment for his father's failure at the Department of Mysteries. Draco had been supposed to take the mark that summer, but he was given a bite instead, on the same forearm. It was equally effective, a threat of what could happen to his family if he were to fail that evil man as his father had. Hermione had played over that conversation she had overheard in Borgin and Burke's, over and over in her head in a different light. But, in the end, not having the Dark Mark, among other things, had kept him out of Azkaban. His father was still at the prison, but wouldn't be for much longer, a few weeks really, having only been given a year after his trial. His mother was only under house arrest for the same length of time, because she didn't have the mark either, and she had saved Harry. But then, so had Draco Malfoy in his own way. Malfoy looked tired like every werewolf who came at sat before her, but that was where the similarities ended. His clothes were immaculate, but of course they would be. He had no visible scars, so she assumed he had taken the wolfsbane potion before every transformation. "What can I help you with, Mr. Malfoy?" Hermione asked. 'Draco' seemed too informal, and just 'Malfoy' would be rude. "Mother thinks I need help. I believe she meant of the psychological kind, but that's not my thing. And then I read something about you being employed here, and I had to see it. How does it feel to be the one in power, Granger? To work for the Department of Control of Magical Creatures, and me being just a beast?" he asked. Hermione was approaching annoyance. "I am attempting to change the verbiage, but other matters have been more pressing. And even they are not so barbaric as to classify you as a beast, except on the full moon. You are classified as a being, just like any other human. I have drawn up papers petitioning that even on the full moon, 'being' status should be retained after the invention of the wolfsbane potion. Most importantly, I am pushing for the potion to be publicly available so that cost is never a prohibitive factor," Hermione laid out. "And psychological counseling is deplorably lacking in the wizarding world, but there is one healer I can recommend; he's very good," Hermione offered. "I don't want to talk to some bloke about being mildly upset about being rejected by every eligible pureblood witch in the country, and in France as well. Mother thinks society in Italy would be more 'open minded' but I've told her to stop trying. They'd been in talks with the Greengrass family since I was a first year. Daphne was promised even by then, but they had intended me for Astoria. And Pansy had always been a reserve, but even she won't look at me now. What's my future going to be like now, Granger? I figured you'd know since you see so many of us. I figure I'll always be alone, so I don't 'pass it on' to anyone else," he groused. That was the sort of close-minded thinking that was far more infectious than the affliction itself. "You can't possibly still think that. Have you met your little cousin Teddy?" Hermione asked. "Yeah, cute kid, whatever," Draco threw off. He was pouting . "Well, he is not a werewolf, and neither was Tonks. It's not a disease that is hereditary or passed sexually, and I have to believe that society will improve in time. My suggestions are gaining traction already. Remus being awarded the posthumous Order of Merit was a huge step, and I hope that publicly funded wolfsbane distribution should start before the new year, but I've been making it now," she said. At her own expense, on her own time, and it was extraordinarily time consuming. "Minerva," she continued- it was strange calling her old professor that, "has been outspoken that they will not hold werewolf status against qualified individuals at Hogwarts, and I hope that the Ministry will be the same by mid next year," she explained. Kingsley was being a big help, and Harry. And even her own name meant something now. "I don't want your pity," Draco groused. "I don't believe I offered it!" Hermione snapped. "Sorry," she said. But it was the first time she had seen Draco Malfoy smile since entering her office, in years, really, even after he'd been cleared of Azkaban. "You're considerably better off than anyone else who has visited my office. You have funds to cover any possible gaps in employment, and loving, supportive parents. And did you love Astoria Greengrass?" She asked a terribly personal question. "She's not even out of Hogwarts. We've hardly ever spoken," Draco answered. "What about Pansy Parkinson?" Hermione pressed. "Annoys the hell out of me," Draco admitted with a small smile. "Then from where I stand, their ignorance and prejudice has saved you from a rather unhappy arranged marriage, and you should be glad ," Hermione stated. "I don't really want to be alone either, Granger," Draco pointed out. "Then I suggest you widen your pool of interest outside of bigoted society girls and find a woman more worth it. And talk to her yourself instead of having your mother write her," Hermione instructed. "You'll be happy, and she'll be far too good for you," she snapped, horribly unprofessionally. Draco Malfoy laughed. "I'm glad this place hasn't ruined you, Granger," he announced, stood, and walked out her door, closing it behind him. She hadn't been under the impression that Draco Malfoy would have thought that there was anything to ruin. *****Hermione***** Hermione next saw Draco Malfoy two weeks later when he walked back into her office. He looked better, though it had been a full moon just two days before. "Change of address," he said, putting a folded piece of parchment on her desk. Draco Malfoy moving out of Malfoy Manor? She grimaced. It was inhuman. "Yes, unfortunately, I have not made progress on the disillusion of the registry, but your new neighbors will no longer be mailed notice," she said. Though it was public record and could be looked up at any time. And anyone would know that Draco Malfoy was a werewolf by now anyway. "I don't think you'd send letters to my muggle neighbors anyway," Draco Malfoy chuckled. Hermione grabbed for the paper and read. "You live in London, surrounded by muggles?" She asked, disbelieving. She would have thought he would be somewhere secluded, or else in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley. "Yes, and they think I'm charming . And an exotic animal trainer- you know, to explain the owls. And the howling," he added the last bit after a pause. Draco Malfoy had moved out of his parents' house and spoken to muggles. "I don't really howl, Granger," he said when she didn't respond. "Though it does sound fun. Maybe I should try," he joked. Or at least she thought it was a joke. "Well, thank you for this, Draco," Hermione tried his first name. "I wish you the best in your new home." "And now you know where I live in case you need it," he commented, walking for the door. In case she needed it? "And Granger?" He added, hand on the knob. "I'm sorry I didn't help you look for the toad on the train," he said, and then he was gone. Very strange. *****Hermione***** She saw him again two weeks later. "How's your new place?" She asked first. She really should have asked what he needed. She hoped it wasn't to move again because something happened. "Good. I'm watching their dog and cat while they're out of town. And their son is fascinated with my owl. And the bird loves anyone with a treat. I've thought about getting a kneazle, one that could be persuaded to do some tricks," he said. "I loved having Crookshanks, my half-kneazle," Hermione commented. It didn't hurt as much as it used to. Draco frowned, "Sorry," he said uncomfortably. "Oh, he's not dead… I think," Hermione said, because she hadn't meant to be depressing. "He's just… with my parents," she said. That didn't sound any better. "And they are?" Draco prompted. "Australia, I think," Hermione admitted. "I- when we were going on the run for horcruxes, I didn't want them to be a target. So I- covered some of their memories with different implanted ones. They think that they never had a daughter and always wanted to move to Australia. It should be completely reversible. I just… haven't been able to find them yet," she said. She had tried. Though she'd also been busy finishing school and then starting work at the Ministry. And she had considered that… perhaps her family was better off without her. They'd be furious when they learned the truth. And afraid of her, as Hermione would be in their place. "What can I do for you?" Hermione asked. Draco was still frowning. "Wolfsbane," he answered. "You will have some ready for the next full moon?" He asked. "Yes, of course," she said. "You can pick up a week's worth on the 17th," she told him. She had thought he'd gotten it elsewhere, but she would help him like anyone else. Draco shook his head. "Just a day at a time. So you can be sure I take it. Very important, because I would never want to endanger those nice muggles, don't you think?" he said. "And here," he dropped a bag that clinked on her desk. "To cover the whole batch because I'm sure your bleeding heart is doing it out of your own pocket," he said, standing again. She shouldn't take that… but the potion was very expensive, and she hadn't really built up much savings yet… most people her age were still living with family. And he wasn't really giving it to her , but to other people suffering with the same thing he was… "Thank you, Draco," she said. And again, at the door, he had something to say. "I'm sorry I called you that awful word our second year. Even sorrier because you didn't know what it was and I introduced you to that hate. I'm sorry I said I hoped the heir of Slytherin would get you next. I was scared, but I didn't really want you hurt or dead, even then," he said. And then he left. *****Day 1***** Right on time on the 17th, Draco came for his one dose of potion he requested. He drank it in front of her, not even phased by the awful taste. And he went to leave again, and again had something to say. Hermione expected it by now, but that didn't mean she knew how to respond when he was saying those things, especially in the place she worked. "I'm sorry for every time I insulted you or your friends. Though Hagrid and the slapping incident is the most memorable," he said. "And for the hippogriff. I know you spent a lot of time working to save it, and I'm sure you did something illegal at the end. I'd love to
