Morphed Secrets- Chapter 1- Secrets Revealed *****Harry, September 24th, 1991 First Floor Corridor***** He was such an idiot , getting lost a month into school when everyone else knew their way around perfectly by now. It was just that- all of the corridors started to look the same to him after a while, and the staircases literally moved . Students raised in magical homes were so comfortable with the strangest things. The portraits weren't reliable guides either- Harry had tried. Some of them were deliberately unhelpful, and they all seemed to view distance and direction strangely, with their odd ability to travel between frames. "Where are you going, Potter?" came one of Harry's least favorite voices at Hogwarts. Harry turned around quickly. It was always worse if they came up on your back. Ugh , Malfoy had his goons with him too. Harry should just run. They didn't know enough magic yet to stop him, and he could probably outrun them, at least the big two, like he did with Dudley. Harry took off running only to collapse against the wall moments later. Was that a tickle charm? What kind of attack was that? It was effective though. "I thought Gryffindors weren't supposed to run away from a fight," Draco Malfoy taunted. "And don't you know where you're going by now, Potter? You were just one hallway down away from the dungeons. You know what happens to Gryffindors lost in the dungeons, right?" he taunted, "We don't ever let them get out," he finished, not waiting or expecting a reply. "You think you're so smart for not showing up for our duel, don't you?" "You didn't show up either," Harry managed to say without laughing, the tickle charm actually becoming painful with his efforts not to laugh. Harry had shown up, and just barely gotten away from getting caught by Filch. Malfoy was the prick who just set Harry up to get in trouble. And Harry couldn't afford to get into big trouble at Hogwarts. " And you got rewarded for breaking the rules in flying class. First years are never supposed to be on the house teams. While I got detention," the blond boy tried to sneer, but it sounded like a whine. "Well, everyone saw you flying too. I guess they didn't want to put you on your house team though," Harry muttered, frustrated with the pain building in his abdomen. But he would regret that. Talking back never made the pain stop. " Our Head of House would never have allowed such a break in tradition. It just isn't done," Draco said defensively but haughtily at the same time. "We could have been friends, you know," the other boy said, releasing the spell at last. Malfoy's two body guards stood by almost lifelessly as the charm faded from Harry's body. He couldn't stand up yet. Harry had been defeated by a tickle charm of all things. What good was stupid fame? It wasn't like Harry was worth anything or did anything to deserve it. Everyone at Hogwarts might as well learn how worthless he was at everything and leave him alone. Except he was rather good at flying, he tried to remember. So not hopeless at everything. "Maybe he needs another lesson to not cross the greatest House of Slytherin again. What do you think?" the blond Slytherin turned to his pet bullies, and with that permission, they started in towards Harry. Harry tried to scramble away, but his midsection ached from holding in the laughter from the tickle charm, and maybe he'd fallen wrong too. Harry just blocked everything out, even the pain as he struggled to get away from the two larger boys hitting and kicking him. They didn't seem to have as much practice as Dudley, or maybe they just didn't have as much experience with Harry in particular. The two swung wildly and Harry could dodge some of it. But soon he had taken a few rib hits, a definite soon-to-be black eye. Oh, his nose again. Not broken this time, Harry didn't think, at least not yet. "What is the meaning of this?" came a low but undeniable voice, Harry's other least favorite voice at Hogwarts. Though for just a moment, he was relieved to hear it, before Harry remembered that Snape hated him as much as Malfoy. At least the boys had stopped hitting him for a moment. But Snape would probably tell them they could keep going since it was just Harry. *****Severus***** Severus Snape, Potions Master and Head of Slytherin, had been… unsettled to come upon such a scene. "Potter," Severus snapped, "Where are your Gryffindor lackeys?" Though Severus could not deny that 'lackeys' was a much more appropriate term for the overgrown toddlers that followed young Draco. But Potter was always with at least one of the other little idiots though, wasn't he? The latest Weasley spawn to come to Hogwarts. Severus wouldn't admit it that it bothered him to see the large buffoons in a physical altercation with the much smaller boy. The little Malfoy heir had been standing well back with his wand held steady- as if the child knew anything of use to do with it. There's another child that was doomed to be just like his father. Severus hadn't known for years what he was supposed to do there. "Miss Farley," Severus snapped, spotting one of his prefects. They were only a floor above and not very far from the Slytherin common room after all. The girl really should have been able to stop the fight herself, even if it was only the Potter brat, who likely deserved it. "Escort Mr. Potter to the hospital wing. Ensure that he stays there long enough for Madame Pomfrey to see to him." "Yes sir," the girl said, rightfully ducking her head in deference or shame, or at least pretending to grant the respect that a professor deserved. Not like the damned Boy Who Lived, Potter's brat, who stared at him, mouth hanging open. What was the boy thinking? *****Harry***** The older, Slytherin girl didn't glance at him once as they walked silently to the Hospital Wing. Harry considered just running back to Gryffindor Tower, but he suspected that Professor Snape wasn't someone he should disobey. Though it wasn't like the unfriendly Head of Slytherin would actually care if Harry just walked around with a painful blackened eye. The swelling would just go away soon though, Harry knew. Like all the other marks always had, no evidence left. "Madame Pomfrey," the girl called as she opened the doors. "Yes, dear," Madame Pomfrey replied, coming into sight. "What can I help you with?" she said, addressing the Slytherin girl after a brief smile in Harry's direction. "Potter got himself-" the girl turned back to him, "hurt?" she finished more quietly. "He was hurt just a minute ago. He was all scratched up, bleeding a bit. His eye was swelling too," the girl offered quizzically, staring at Harry. Harry shifted on his feet. He hated being stared at. Everyone was always doing that in the magical world. "Well, Mr. Potter, let's fix you up before bruises even have a chance to show up, now why don't we?" The girl was still studying Harry intently. "It was going to be a badly blackened eye, Madame Pomfrey. I didn't think he was going to be able to see out of it just a few minutes ago. He must have done something," she said, but she said it in a way that seemed to indicate that Harry spontaneously healing was a bad thing. If that was what he had done already. Harry had certainly been wishing it away hard enough. It still smarted pretty badly, but Harry wasn't going to say anything that might keep him there longer. Why would people be surprised by magic here? Ron had explained about accidental magic before. That was all it was. Madame Pomfrey frowned slightly as she ran her wand around Harry's head and bustled off, presumably to fetch some vile tasting potion. Harry wondered how soon he could leave. "Where does it hurt, dear?" she asked upon her return. The Slytherin girl had backed up several steps but hadn't left the room. Harry wished she would. After the first few spells, Madame Pomfrey's frown grew, "Curious," she mumbled to herself, "The damage is still there, but we can't see it. Do you know why that is, dear?" she asked gently. "I- really?" Harry asked. "I guess it still hurts a little bit," Harry admitted. "Have you learned about any concealing spells from anyone, or from a book, Mr. Potter?" Madame Pomfrey said, returning to her businesslike manner. "No-honest- I just- wanted it to be gone," Harry replied, nervous of the nurse's questions. To Harry's surprise, the matron smiled, "It might sound like a strange question, but can I ask when was the last time you had your hair cut, Mr. Potter?" "Aah… About two years ago my aunt cut most of it off," Harry said, startled by the question, "It grew back by the next day though. I didn't know that it was accidental magic then," Harry added feeling foolish. "Hmm..." Madame Pomfrey nodded, still smiling. "Did you have regular haircuts before that time?" "I don't think so," Harry replied, "My hair just doesn't grow much. It's pretty stubborn to stay just the way it is," Harry explained, feeling foolish as he did so. Normal people's hair didn't do that, did it? Was he a freak even among wizards? "Miss Farley, thank you for bringing Harry, but I can handle it from here, dear," the kind witch dismissed the girl. Harry liked the matron more now. When the girl was gone, Madame Pomfrey asked, "Have there been times before this where bruises and cuts have disappeared but still hurt?" She was still smiling, looking excited even, so it probably wasn't anything bad. "Um, I- maybe. From playing outside sometimes I guess. I just thought that I healed quickly, more accidental magic I guess." "Not quite, Mr. Potter, though I dare say that you would have found healing abilities quite useful if I have already seen you here so soon- which I expect not to continue, young man," Madame Pomfrey said lightly. "I believe, Mr. Potter, that you are a metamorphmagus. It is a rather rare ability. You would be only the second I have seen, after a young witch who graduated just last June. You remind me a bit of her when I first met the girl. She was clumsy, always getting scraped up and not wanting to come see me. But it's very exciting, really. If you have as much of a knack for the skill as I think, you can learn to change your outward appearance to a very high degree, with no more than a wish. You won't even need a wand." Harry smiled for the first time in hours. He could learn to change what he looked like. To not be Harry Potter for a day, or maybe forever. To not have the stares, the whispers, a past that he didn't even understand. Even Dudley wouldn't know who he was. That could be a type of magic that he could really enjoy. *****Harry***** Harry and Ron sat, quietly talking in the squishy armchairs near the fireplace that they favoured when they could grab them. The older students more often had so much work that they preferred the chairs by the long tables. Harry had been explaining to Ron everything that Madame Pomfrey had told him, hoping that the Common Room noise would prevent too many others from listening in too closely. "So you can change whatever you look like? Can you look like an adult? I bet we could get hold of
