I'll keep you updated with what I've changed and who's who. And btw I own no lotr stuff. I know sad isn't it. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Chapter one: A Cinderella Story A young girl sat in a large oak tree reading out of a brown leather bound book with gold leaves engraved on it. It was one of her favorites. The book told of eight heroes that protected an enchanted world filled with fantasy and wonder. The legend said that the heroes overthrew the dark lord and restored peace to the land, only in the process were never seen again. This part always seemed to disturb her a little. She had read many books that had endings like that, but none of them made her as depressed as that one did. She guessed it was because it was her favorite story. This was her sixth time reading it and she was almost at her favorite part, where the heroes meet the Dark Lord- The Heroes were sneaking through the forest near the dark tower, ready to fight any coming evil, when... "Kikona!" She heard her cousin bellow. "Kikona! Come here right now! It's almost time for school and you still have to iron our clothes and do our homework!" Her other cousin yelled. Kikona ignored them and tried to keep reading. "Fine Kikona! Let's just see what mom has to say!" Kikona slammed her book shut, and carefully climbed down the tree. She knew she had to hurry before her twin cousins reached her aunt Claire first, and told some lie to get her in trouble. Aunt Claire would believe anything her "darling" twin daughters, Cate and Cloe, said. They hated Kikona like she was some loathsome slug, and unfortunately she had to live with them. Ever since her parents had died everything had come crashing down, and she remembered the exact day. It was third grade. They had just come in from recess and she was wearing her new pink dress her mom had picked out. She was talking to her best friend, Amanda, when her teacher got an unexpected phone call. "I'm so sorry, Kikona" The teacher had said as she kneeled to hug her. "Your parents were just killed in a car crash." She was sent home early that day and was soon picked up by Aunt Claire. She cried for months after that. Kikona looked up at the sky, through the leaves of a tree. It was so beautiful that morning. Everything was bathed in rays of light. She walked through the wide trail, her aunt's mansion in view. The mansion that used to belong to her parents. Kikona ran over the fields of fresh green grass, past the barn, through the garden, and up the stone stairs before opening one of the large glass doors that led inside. "There she is, Mother" Cloe stated just as she came in. Kikona looked at her aunt and knew she wasn't pleased. 'Like she ever is.' she thought. "Kikona! Why aren't the chores done?" Aunt Claire asked sharply. "Yeah" Her cousins added in a sassy kinda way. Kikona's gaze fell to the stone floor. "Well? I'm waiting" She didn't have to look up to know Cloe and Cate were smiling. "I was reading" She said finally, and it looked as though aunt Claire would explode. "Reading!" She yelled. "Reading! You had chores to do and you were reading!" Aunt Claire took a deep breath. 'I'm surprised she hasn't started that sob story of how she took me in from the "goodness" of her heart.' Kikona thought. Then aunt Claire spoke again "We took you in from the goodness of our hearts and this is how you repay us?" 'Spoke too soon.' At that moment the door bell rang. "Go upstairs and get ready for school." Aunt Claire said quietly as she straightened her clothes to go answer the door. Cate and Cloe frowned at the fact she wasn't punished more severely. Kikona walked up the stairs and into her room, which was one of many in the entire house. They had thirty-four bathrooms and fifty-five bedrooms on the second floor. Their was a library and a small gym room along with the kitchen, living room, and every thing else in a normal house on the first floor, not to mention two large sets of stairs on each side of the house. Kikona ran into her room and grabbed her favorite pair of jeans and a green striped shirt from the bed, which she quickly put on. Then she took her brush and combed her long wavy brown hair. After she was done, Kikona walked to her large writing desk and picked up a few books and papers, not to mention the book of the eight heroes, before stuffing them in her backpack and running down the stairs. Aunt Claire and the twins were already dressed and waiting. "Well its about time, Kikona." Her aunt said sternly. "Did you do our homework?" asked Cloe quietly, as her mother left. Kikona pulled a bunch of papers from her backpack and handed them to her. Cloe grinned. "Good, at least you can do something right. What about our reports on Norway and Sweden?" Kikona looked confused. "Reports? What reports?" Cloe put her hands on her hips. "The reports that are due Thursday." Kikona still looked clueless. "Look, Kikona, You had better have those reports done by tomorrow, so we can have extra credit for having it a day early." said Cloe. "Yeah, or else." added Cate smiling at her older sister. Even though they were twins, Cloe was older by five minutes. "Or else, what?" asked Kikona already having an idea of what they were thinking. "Or else, we'll tell mom that you're not doing your job. And she'll have oh so much fun locking you in your room..." said Cloe but was interrupted by Cate. "Yeah, especially since the fall dance is coming up." she said "Not like anyone would ask you!" Cloe said laughing with her twin. Kikona walked around them and out the front door. Unlike Cate and Cloe, who drove to school, she had to walk. Even though her aunt was forced by the law to let her take driver's ed, and even though she passed with flying colors and got her driver's license, her aunt didn't buy her a car and rarely let her drive. Kikona heard her cousins rev the gas of their 98' red corvette, and drive off down the dirt driveway. "Have fun walking, Loser!" Cloe yelled as they sped onto the road. Kikona ignored them and kept walking, if she hurried maybe she could catch the bus to school. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& She didn't catch the bus. Turns out they switched drivers that morning and the new one couldn't find the way to her bus stop. Which means if he ever did find it everyone there was guaranteed to be late. Instead of waiting, she decided to just run to school; maybe she could still be on time. Unfortunately she was not on time and just to her luck it had rained almost the entire trip there. She was soaked from head to toe. Kikona trudged to her first class, math, leaving small puddles of water with every step. It wouldn't have been so bad if Cate and Cloe weren't in that class with her. She could imagine what they would say, and what the teacher would do when she walked in. She would probably get a referral or detention, since this wasn't the first time. Kikona opened the door to the classroom and quietly took her seat on the far side of the room. Everyone had stopped what they had been doing when she walked in. "Miss Johnson, You realize this is the ninth time you've been late for this semester." Said her teacher Mr. Smith. "Yes, sir" She answered. "And you realize you will serve a detention because of it." Kikona nodded. Cloe raised her hand and put on her sweet girl act. "Yes, Cloe?" asked Mr. Smith. "Well, Sir, Maybe her car broke down!" She said with a smile. Everyone giggled except Kikona's two best friends, Kyle and Amanda. It seemed Cate and Cloe had told the entire school she didn't have a car, which would have been okay if this wasn't a rich high school and everyone had a car. "Or maybe it was stolen!" Added Cate now laughing with the entire class. "OK, That's enough! I'll hear no more of it! Back to math class." yelled Mr. Smith. Kikona took out her books and waited for the class to end. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Ring! Ring! Kikona sighed as the school bell rang. Finally it was over. She gathered her books, about to join her friends, when Cloe bumped into her causing her books to fall to the ground. Cloe smirked at her before running back to her friends. Kikona knelt down to pick up her books, but was stopped by Amanda and Kyle "Are you OK?" asked Amanda, bending down to help her. "Yeah, I'm fine." She answered quietly, as they walked out into the hall. Kikona didn't say anything the whole way to their lockers. Then Kyle spoke "Hey I'm sorry Cloe and Cate did that to you." He said quietly "Its OK. They do it all the time." Kikona put her math books away and grabbed her English book. " Yeah but you shouldn't have to deal with that." answered Amanda, looking her straight in the eyes. "You deserve better." Kikona turned her gaze to the floor. "I gotta go. I'm late for class." she said as the bell rang. They watched her turn the corner before walking to Literature class. "She just needs time. She'll be over everything tomorrow." said Amanda "She just needs time." The rest of the day Kikona couldn't pay attention in any of her classes, and kept staring at the clock on the back wall. During her last class Kikona put her head down on her desk. 'Just for a little while' she thought as her eyelids began to drop. After a few minutes she began to dream- She was running through the forest. Running away from something. She tried to run faster, but her legs felt as heavy as lead, and the monster seemed to be catching up. Kikona felt her sides cramping up and her breath coming out in gasps. She knew she wouldn't be able to run much longer. Now that she thought about it why was she running from it and why was it chasing her? Kikona was about to give up and find out why, when she saw some sort of man-made under ground cave. From far away the top looked only like a huge flat rock, but as she got closer she saw that there was a small opening under it with rock stairs leading deep under ground. Without another thought, she ran down them hoping the monster was too big to fit. Within minutes Kikona reached the end of the spiral stairs, only to find out it was not a cave, but a house. 'How interesting' she thought as she roamed around. It looked as though whoever lived there was only planning on leaving for a moment. There were bright candles, books upon books lying on a large wooden table, most lying unopened, and something delicious cooking over a roaring fire. It also had some furniture like a chair or two and a small bed against the wall. Kikona backed up trying to get a view of
