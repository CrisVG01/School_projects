There is nothing I can do about it, I have to go back home. Home, for most it brings up a bunch of great memories and feelings; for me however just the mere thought of going home brings up nothing but negativity and dread. Sadly these feelings are all caused by family. They have never really showed any compassion for me, everything has always revolved around my sister. Me, I've always been in the background. Hell, if I'm being honest I think my parents are dreading me coming home even more than I am. You see the only reason that I'm coming home is because I got a job. Ever since high school I knew that I wanted to dance, and teach. So I decided to become a kindergarten teacher, I love children they are so innocent and trusting. It doesn't help that they are really the only people that I can have conversations with. I'm almost cripplingly shy. I guess I should say a little more about myself. My name is Kimberly Lynn Connweller and I am a recent graduate of John Hopkins University. As I've already said I'm about to start my first year as a kindergarten teacher. I will be working at the Tribal school back home. I love my home town, though I guess I should say I love my litter reservation. I live in La Push Washington a small Indian reservation about twenty minutes away from Forks. The only thing the town has to show for itself is its beautiful beaches and cliffs. The beaches were my personal favorite; no one ever bothered you there. And you could just look out on the horizon which never changed and seemed to go on forever, it was actually very relaxing. "Kimberly! Would you at least humor me by pretending to listen to me!" My mom snapped at me pulling me out of my thoughts. "Sorry mom, what was it that you were saying?" I say with a small sigh turning to look at my mother who had insisted on driving me home. "I was asking you how long you were planning on staying at home with me, because as you know you are an adult and should be paying for everything yourself. Your sister never felt the need to move back in with me after college when she got her job." My mom said making sure to put emphasis on the word job. "That's because Kelly got knocked up and married right after getting a job. She moved in with her husband who you refused to even meet until the wedding. And if you remember correctly Kelly doesn't even have her job anymore because she got fired." I say quietly. "Your sister doesn't have her job because of some bullshit lie that a jealous coworker spread about her. You also know that she hasn't gone back to work because she is busy being a stay at home mom which is more than I can say for you what have you been doing for the past couple years? I haven't even heard of you having a boyfriend! You've never had a boyfriend! So I'm going to take all the grandchildren I can get out of Kelly thank you." "I'VE been going to school so that I could get a job for the past couple years, and I've had boyfriends they were never anything serious. I didn't want to waste your time if they weren't going to stick around for a long time." I said with a sigh thinking back to the one boy that I would have dropped everything to be with. I know that any normal person would have forgotten about their high school crush by now. But there was something about him that could even now make my heart beat faster and makes me a nervous wreck. Not that I'm not normally a nervous wreck in front of other people but still there is something different about the way that he could make me feel. "Just go put your things in your room. I'm not going to deal with your attitude anymore." My mom snapped slamming the door to her car shut and walking into the house. I sigh and look at the house, the one place that I never wanted to come back too. I slowly got all of my things and walked into the house not bothering to say anything to my mother as I went up the stairs to my little room. I was going to start apartment hunting in the morning I just had to make it through tonight. Hopefully I wasn't going to have to stay here long. Maybe I will just get some sleep; it has to be late enough to do that right? I mean come on; I've been in a plane for hours then add on a three hour ride in the car alone with my mother. I deserve to get a little sleep, so that I can prepare to start my life here tomorrow. With these thoughts in mind I decide to skip dinner and just go straight to bed. BREAK UGH I groan as the little bit of light that Washington gets drifts through my curtains waking me up. I roll over and look at my clock to see what time the world had dared to wake me up and see that it's already 830 in the morning. I guess that means I should get started on the day, I have to try and get some apartment shopping done. Even if I can only find a temporary place until I find some place that I can actually stay other than my mother's house. I quickly jump out of bed and grab my favorite apple scented body wash from my bag then run to the shower. I set the temperature to as warm as I can stand it and let the warm water relax and prepare me for the long day I was going to have. I stayed in the shower a little longer than I should have, waiting until the water started to get cold before wrapping myself back in a towel and heading back to my room to find something decent to wear. I didn't want to be too dressy, but I didn't want to look like a slob. I guess that means I should try and find something semi causal to wear. I walked over to my bag, which I had been too lazy to unpack last night and started digging through. Something casual, this can't be too difficult to find can it? Of course it can because almost all of my clothing is made of stuff that own for work. I never really was one to dress down, so now when I want to of course it's going to be difficult. After digging for what felt like hours I finally found an outfit which I thought would be suitable for the weather and not too overly dressy. I quickly threw on a pair of light blue skinny jeans which hugged my curves in all the right places, not to mention made my butt look amazing. I paired my jeans with my favorite Aztec tank with my bright yellow jacket. I also threw on a pair of pink toms for comfort while walking and my favorite necklace that my dad gave me before moving to London. Then threw my already almost dry hair up into a loose high pony and deemed myself ready for the day. ( kims_first_day_home/set?id=130978124) I walked down stairs with a grabbed an apple for breakfast before saying a quick hello to my mother and walking out the door. I had to accomplish two things today, attempt to find a place to stay as well as contact my best friend and pray that she will be able and willing to complete the long journey of driving my car from Maryland to Washington. Well I already know that she is willing I just have to pray that she has decided to leave, so I'm not waiting three months for me car. My car is my baby, and also my graduation gift from my daddy; a red Mercedes Benz S-class. My daddy has a lot of money which is a really nice perk when you're a daddy's girl like me. I've always been close to my dad, even after he left my mom moved to Paris and remarried. This is part of the problem that my mom and sister have with me, they hate that my dad takes such good care of me when they feel he should be contributing to them, this is completely false if you ask me. They just want to use him for his money and could care less that he and his wife have hit a rough patch and he's trying to do everything in his power to win her back. Dad is one of those people who are normally more invested in his job than in his family, unless that family is me then he's completely invested. Daddy loved La Push and he only left for his new wife, everyone expected it to be the other way around when word of my parents upcoming divorce spread around the reservation. They expected mom to leave because it's no secret that she hates it here, but instead she and my sister stayed while I went off to live with my dad because as my mom said, "Why would we want to keep that brat here?" I lived with my dad through my junior and senior years of high school, and if I'm being honest I don't think that anyone noticed that I was gone. I didn't have many friends in La Push, unless you count Embry the boy who always had a little crush on me. Embry and I never became anything more than friends partly because I moved away right as we were starting to get close and partly because well, my heart through all of high school belonged to another boy. That other boy being Jared Cameron. Jared was the center of my universe through all of my time in La Push; I don't know what it was about him. Maybe his popularity and the fact that I hadn't grown into myself and I was just an awkward child, who didn't really appeal to anyone, let alone the king of the entire school! Anyways, enough about Jared he is long gone and just a childhood crush who never noticed me. I knew from Facebook that Embry was still living in La Push not that he ever posted much; I only saw the pictures that his mom would post. Mama Call was like my second mother who actually cared about me all through my time here, well you know until I moved but I think everyone is starting to understand that. Maybe I will go visit her at the store, I haven't seen her in years and I've really missed her. I used to call her every night when I lived in Paris, and we would just talk for hours. I still talk to her a little now, but not enough for her to know that I'm coming back and I love surprising people so
