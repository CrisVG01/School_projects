The Heir Test Chapter 1 Harry was on the train to go back to Hogwarts, it was now his 6th year, Harry was still grieving for Sirius and then Dumbledore strode in to Privet Drive Earlier this summer saying the ministry has decided to reinstate another old tradition at Hogwarts, the heir test, to start finding long lost heirs to houses and filling up seats in the Wizengamot, Dumbledore could not stop it or hide it from Harry any longer, apparently Harry is the Heir and should of become Lord to the Ancient and Noble houses of Potter and Black at age 11, should off, but Dumbledore kept it from him by saying 'you should of not had to deal with it and have had a good childhood' but Harry knew better. He knew Dumbledore was a manipulative old coot, trying to do everything for the 'Greater Good'. He found out Dumbledore just wants me to deny the Lordships and hand them over to him along with the vaults, but I denied of course, when Dumbledore left, he had some serious thinking to do, he figured out he could no longer trust the Weasley Matriarch or even his best friend Ron and Girlfriend Ginny, He could only trust Fred, George and Arthur, he suspected he could trust Charlie and Bill but he did not know them well. What he wouldn't do just to have true friends and not be manipulated, you see that's where enters Hermione, Neville & Luna. The three come into the compartment and sit down, they had all been to the prefect meeting, Luna got made one while Ron's got taken off him and given to Neville. Harry had made it perfectly clear to Ron, Ginny and Dumbledore that he never wanted to speak to them again, they were dead to him. The train arrived at the station on time as usual and the now Golden Quartet headed to one of the carriages where the thestrals were waiting, they got in and quickly headed up to the castle where Dumbledore was waiting at the entrance 'welcoming' students in. "Harry, my boy, I must impress on you to come straight up to my office, we have a lot discuss" Impressed Dumbledore "Albus, my man, I must have not made it so clear enough to you that I do not wish to be a part of your manipulations any longer and will not come with you anywhere, as I am now back at this school I enact clause 532 in the Hogwarts Charter, which states should a student request it, they can have no form of contact with the headmaster and all means of contact must go through their head of house, the headmaster is to have no contact with this student for whatever reason, goodbye Albus, and stay out of my head, yes that's right I learned Occlumency." Demanded Harry "Harry I must insist, AHHH" shouted Dumbledore "You See Albus, Magic recognises I have enacted the clause and Hogwarts will give you a bigger shock every time you try to talk to me, I'm hungry, goodbye" said Harry as he walked away Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna headed into the great hall and sat down at the Gryffindor table while Luna went over to the Ravenclaw table. Once they sat down they waited, talked and chatted with their fellow Gryffindor's and watched the new sorting happen. This year's song was much different, he sang. "Back in times of Old, When I was young and I was told, To sort young minds and judge them where they ought to go, Gryffindor for those who are brave, Slytherin for those who are cunning, Ravenclaw for those of sharp mind and Hufflepuff where true loyalty strikes, I have warned this school time and time again, And now it is my turn to stop, I will sort you as that is my job; I am not a talking mop, This year an old test has been reinstated, by outside and inside forces working together, Under the toil of this administration this school has gone to pot, Goodbye, Farwell, for I am done, now my last thing to say is I hereby declare my life force at an end, the founders have returned, and it will be there job once more, I will no longer sort, I no longer Talk, this sorting is postponed until tomorrow when they have returned, So I say it, so mote it be." The sorting hat then curled up into a ball with a blinding flash of white light the sorting hat was gone with only a few ashes remaining, apparently, the founders had returned and they will be back tomorrow which coincidently is the day of the heir tests (inheritance tests), so it is obvious that there are heirs to the founders here and will take control once more. Dumbledore had paled at the hats words and conjured a new table for all the first years to sit at and quickly talked to an elf to sort out rooms, this was most unusual. Obviously, the hat was fed up and decided to give its job away, poor hat, suffering under Dumbledore all these years, no wonder it gave up its life. The food was summoned and they ate quite normally, apart from the hat committing suicide, the year was going as normal as any. They were ushered off to dormitories with the first years being sent by one of the professors to temporary accommodation. Tomorrow there would be a lot going on, the founders returning to take care of the castle once more and the inheritance tests for all those in the school, it certainly would be a long year indeed! The next morning, the students made their way down to the great hall, where awaiting them was a squad of 500 goblins, each with stacks of parchment and a ceremonial knife to conduct the inheritance tests with; probably today they will discover quite a few lost houses. People had to go in groups of 4 to the goblins so Harry, Hermione, Neville and Luna went together. The goblin talked them through what would happen and the possibility they might be an heir to a house forgotten or they might have a betrothal contract which would have to be carried out almost immediately. The four cut their Hands across 4 different pieces of parchment. First to get their results was Hermione, the piece of parchment dinged like a bell when it was done and the goblin and Hermione read Inheritance of one Hermione Jean Granger Blood Status: Pureblood through lines of squibs Heir & Lady of the houses: Lady of the Most Noble & Most Ancient house of Ravenclaw Lady of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of MacKinnon Lady of the Most Noble & Ancient house of Clarkson Lady of the Noble & Ancient house of Lewis Marriage contracts: 1 in the Ravenclaw Line to one Luna Selene Lovegood of the House of Slytherin 0 In the MacKinnon Line 0 in the Clarkson Line 0 in the Lewis line New Name: Lady Ravenclaw MacKinnon Clarkson Lewis Granger Next up was Luna's whose read Inheritance of one Luna Selene Lovegood Blood Status: Pureblood Heir or Lady to the houses: Lady of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Slytherin Heir to the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Lovegood Lady of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Nostradamus Lady of the Most Noble & Ancient House of Connor Marriage Contracts: 1 in the Slytherin Line to one Hermione Jean Granger of the House of Ravenclaw 1 in the Lovegood Line to the Nostradamus Line, 0 to currently marry 1 in the Nostradamus Line to the Lovegood Line, 0 to currently marry 0 in the Connor Line New Name: Lady Slytherin Nostradamus Connor, Heir Lovegood Neville's Parchment Read Inheritance of one Neville Francis Longbottom Blood Status: Pureblood Lord to the Houses: Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Hufflepuff Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Longbottom Lord of the Most Noble & Ancient House of Lloyd Lord of the Noble & Ancient House of Drain Marriage Contracts: 1 in the Hufflepuff Line to one Harry James Potter of House Gryffindor 0 in the Longbottom line 0 in the Lloyd line 1 in the Drain line to the House of Walker, 0 candidates to marry as of yet New name: Lord Hufflepuff Longbottom Lloyd Drain Finally Harry's Parchment Read Inheritance of one Harrison James Evans-Potter Blood Status: Pureblood Lord to the Houses: Lord of the Most Noble, Most Ancient & Royal House of Pendragon Lord of the Most Noble, Most Ancient & Magical House of Emrys Lord of the Most Noble, Most Ancient & Magical House of LeFay Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Gryffindor Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Potter Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Black Lord of the Most Noble & Most Ancient House of Evans Marriage Contracts: 0 in the Pendragon Line 1 in the Emrys Line to the LeFay Line (0 candidates) 1 in the LeFay Line to the Emrys Line (0 candidates) 1 in the Gryffindor Line to the Hufflepuff Line (one Neville Francis Longbottom) 0 in the Potter Line 0 in the Black Line 0 in the Evans Line New Name: His Royal Highness Lord Pendragon Emrys LeFay Gryffindor Potter Black Evans The Four Children looked down on the parchment with awe while the goblin tasked with their inheritances was in shock, he quickly got over it and called all goblins to attention to bring the rings of these prestigious houses, all goblins halted what they were doing to watch these children ascend to their place. "Okay the four of you, put all your rings onto one finger, don't worry they will meld together, you must take this oath to accept your new found station, this will then be registered with the ministry, in your case Heir Pendragon, it will mean the ministries of Europe will now be void and you will need to sit on the throne, first we will start with you Ms Granger" "I Hermione Jean Granger Accept my Heritage and take up the Ladyship's of the Lines of Ravenclaw, MacKinnon, Clarkson and Lewis and will to the best of my ability uphold the laws of the land and to look after its citizens. So Mote It Be" Hermione then flashed in Bright Blue light while her robes changed to reflect her house crests" "I Luna Selene Lovegood Accept my Heritage and take up the Ladyship's of the Lines of Slytherin, Nostradamus and Connor while formally accepting the Heir Ship of Lovegood. I will to the best of my ability uphold the laws of the land and look after its citizens. So Mote It Be" "I Neville Francis Longbottom accept my heritage and take up the Lordship's of the Lines Hufflepuff, Longbottom, Lloyd and Drain and will to the best of my ability uphold the laws of the land and to look after its citizens. So Mote It Be" Luna and Neville both flashed Green and Yellow personally before sitting back down and watching Harry "I Harrison James Potter-Evans do hereby accept my heritage and take up the throne and lordship to the lines of Pendragon, Emrys, LeFay, Gryffindor, Potter, Black and Evans. I will do my best to correct the wrongdoings of society and protect each citizen within Magical Europe; I retake my throne of my line and banish the Ministries of Europe. So Mote it Be" Harry's voice boomed on the mote and there was blinding flashes of Royal Blue, Royal Red and Royal Silver before the light died down and in front of Harry all goblins and wizards were kneeling and swearing fealty to the crown, all over magical Europe wizards, magical races and magical creatures were now compelled to bow
