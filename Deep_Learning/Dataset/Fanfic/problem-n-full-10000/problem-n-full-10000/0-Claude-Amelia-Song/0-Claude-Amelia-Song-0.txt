Thank you very much! Once upon a time, there lived a king and a queen who ruled together in the magical world of Agrabah. There were no wars or crimes in the kingdom, and all was fair and just. Sadly, it was not to last. For the king and queen would commit a terrible crime. The queen and king had twin daughters named Padma and Parvati. They were as beautiful as the sun and the moon, and they loved each other very much. Sadly, the girls had never known the love of their parents. They had only each other and their nursemaid. Their parents had adored them when they were infants. Unfortunately, not long after, Fate had struck its deal with Destiny and a prophecy had been foretold: one of the princesses was fated to become the most evil sorceress in history. This knowledge tore their family apart. The queen couldn't bear the thought of loving a monster. And, not knowing which one of her identical daughters it could be, she pushed both of them away. No matter how hard the girls tried, they could not move the hearts of their parents. Others had tried as well, telling them that it was not right to shut out one's own children based on a mere prophecy that might never come true. Still, though, their hearts were unmoved. They did refuse to put their daughters to death because they knew that only one was fated to become the evil sorceress. By law, not even they could condemn an innocent to death. Though killing an innocent was forbidden, they had devised another way of handling their problem. They had noticed that Padma appeared to be starting down a dark path. Padma was quiet. She liked to read and study. She stared at her parents with a calculating look in her eyes. On the twins' eighth birthday, they decided to to do something about it. Padma was dragged from the the library to the throne room and forced down to her knees in front of her parents. Parvati had screamed when the guards had taken her sister. Padma went quietly, but not before slipping her ring to her twin. Originally, Padma had been trying to make matching necklaces of the sun and moon, the kingdom's symbols, for her parents. They, however, had rejected her gifts. It was then that Padma realized that not even the real sun and the real moon would be enough for her parents. Yoni and Astaraz were never going to see past the spectre of the evil sorceress hanging over them. So Padma had started to learn magic. After much practice, she had managed to create a charmed object. It was a binding spell, one that connected the spellcaster with the ring so that she could find it if she lost it. She just hoped it would be enough. It anchored a part of her in the ring, so her sister would still have a connection with her. "Do you know why you are here?" the queen asked. Padma nodded, but said nothing. She knew there was nothing she could say to change their minds. She wondered what they were going to do with her. Padma looked up to see her father, no, the king, entering the chamber with an old man who held a lamp in his hands. "What are you going to do with me?" she whispered, suddenly afraid. The old man looked at her with pure hatred. "Silence!" One guard shouted, cuffing the little princess on her shoulder and making her cry in pain. The man laughed. "I'm going to make sure you won't hurt anyone ever again." I would never, Padma wanted to scream, but she knew it was useless. The old man touched the lamp and shouted, "Genie of the lamp, I command you to come forward!" Padma's eyes widened. A genie? With an explosion of smoke and flame, a blue man appeared out of thin air and bowed in front of him. "Master, what can I do for you? This is your last wish, so choose carefully," the genie said. The man smiled. "I want you to trap this girl somewhere she cannot hurt anyone. Where her evil nature cannot develop and she will never be seen again." The genie bowed. "As you wish, Master." Padma disappeared before their eyes. The king and queen breathed a sigh of relief. Now they could finally live free of their fear. Alas, it was not to be. One cannot cheat fate and escape destiny. In trying to avoid it, one can can only aid it in becoming true. In the act of sending Padma away, Yoni and Astaraz had done exactly that. They thought she had been trapped or was finally dead, but little did they know that she was still in the castle with her sister. It is said that when dealing with a genie, one must be sly and cunning; each wish must be worded as carefully as one would read the fine print of a magical contract. Unfortunately for Yoni and Astaraz, the old man they had hired to banish their daughter was neither of these things. The genie had sensed Padma's link with the ring and, sensing that affinity, his magic transformed her into a ghostly version of herself. She was trapped in between the world of the living and the afterlife, silently watching over her sister just as she'd wished. The genie knew that the king and queen had chosen the wrong twin to trap, so he used the vagueness of the wish to aid Padma as much as he could. In essence, Padma had been trapped as her sister's guardian. Back at the castle, things had changed for Parvati too. Though they'd slammed the doors to the throne room in her face, she had heard everything. For the first time in her life, Parvati was filled with fury. Something in her heart broke when her sister was so heartlessly sealed away in some unknown place by her own flesh and blood. She had been kept in the dark and surrounded by lies. Ten years passed. Parvati plotted to avenge her sister and trained tirelessly in the magical arts in hopes of making her parents pay. Padma spent that time filled with sadness as she watched her sister's heart grow darker and darker by the day. Once Padma had been banished, the king and queen had begun to treat Parvati with love and affection. Parvati smiled and played along, but inside she was biding her time. Little did they know that it was far too late for them to reclaim their daughter's love. Four days after her sister's disappearance, Parvati had met Master J., a wizard who had offered to secretly teach her magic. Over the years, he had only reinforced her hatred for her parents, and the world. Before long, the confused and angry eight-year old girl had grown into a powerful sorceress. It was far too late when her parents realised their mistake. They had tried to capture her, but she had escaped with her master's help. Master J. promised Parvati that once they got their revenge on the king and queen, that he would help her find her sister. First, however, he told her it was essential that she found the lamp. Truth be told, Master J. had his own agenda and the young princess, now turned fugitive, was just a means to get what he wanted: the kingdom to rule and the genie to control. He too knew about her fate. As far as he was concerned, he just helped things along. Parvati searched tirelessly for the lamp in the hopes that she could wish her sister back, but it had been hidden well. Meanwhile, Master J. had started a war with the royal family and he was winning. The king and queen had been taken prisoner, but there was still a resistance, made up of the magical beings that resided within Agrabah. Master J. was not worried. Once he had the lamp and complete control over the genie, no magical force would ever be able to stop him. Fate, however, was not on his side. It wasn't long until Parvati tracked down the old man and his lamp. He was summoned to the palace and shown into the throne room, as before. This time, however, Parvati was sitting on the throne with Master J. sitting to her right. She kept her face covered with a veil so that the man would not recognize her. "Your Highness." The man bowed in front of her. "Enough pleasantries," came her sharp retort. "You took something very important from me and I want it back. Now." She commanded. "Your Highness?" The man looked confused. Parvati pulled her veil away from her face and snarled. "I want the lamp. So be a nice old man and give it to me." The man recoiled in shock. "Over my dead body." he said, and a ball of light appeared in his hand. "That can be arranged." She reached forward as if to grab him, but did not touch him. The old man was lifted off of the ground by her magic and began choking, unable to do anything to free himself. Her hold was too strong. "Have mercy, please…" he managed to whisper. Parvati's eyes darkened. " Me ? Mercy! Never ." "Then our attempts to stop the prophecy were in vain. Your parents chose the wrong sister. You are indeed the evil one. You wouldn't even spare an old man," the man choked out, fear in his eyes. Parvati dropped him in a heap and watched him breathing in ragged gasps. "Oh, I would spare an old man . And I have mercy, but not for you. Never for you. You are the one who took my sister away from me," Parvati said, tears in her eyes. "Now, bring the lamp and summon the genie or I will make you regret defying me." The man bowed his head again. "I cannot call him, but you may take the lamp." He pulled the golden object from within his robes and threw it to the ground at Parvati's feet. With that, Parvati summoned the guards to have him thrown into the dungeon. As she touched the lamp, the blue genie appeared in front of her. "Mistress, I am yours to command. You get three wishes. No more, no less," he said, looking at her with wide eyes. He could see that she was nearly identical to the girl he had been forced to trap years ago. They widened even further when he noticed his former master on the floor. "Well, what do you want?" the genie asked, afraid of the answer he was going to receive. There was so much darkness in her eyes. "I…" she started, but before she could say anything, Master J. approached them. He smiled, his eyes focused on the lamp in her hand. "Now, my dear, it's time for your revenge," the sorcerer said, looking gleefully at the lamp and transporting them into the dungeons where her parents were held. "Destroy them, princess," he said, pointing to her parents who had been kept prisoners for years. The genie watched her carefully and then spoke. "Do you really wish for this, Mistress? Do you have no mercy?"
