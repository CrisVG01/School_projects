AN: OK. Welcome to my first multi-chapter story! First, I would like to explain Hermione's 'heritage' in this story. She isn't necessarily pure, but she isn't muggleborn either. (They were all raised with 'pureblood etiquette')Basically, her father comes from the pureblooded bloodline of Dagworth-Granger. Hermione's mother is unknown in this story (or is she? NYEHEHEHE) However, he is the very first squib in the family, which sorta disparages the Granger name in the pureblooded society (for the supremacists, at least). So when he has Hermione and she doesn't begin to show magical abilities immediately, he neglects her and always prefers his son over her, since he displays magical abilities. This neglect leads to... MY STORY ;D ENJOY! As always, Harry Potter belongs to JK ROWLING. Characters you don't recognize belong to me. also, beware of a future darkish Hermione and Harry ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: December 22, 1984 Southeast England Rays of light streamed through the window, showering the blue and purple accented room in an orange hue. As the sun went higher in the sky and the room grew brighter, the young girl on the bed gave a groan of annoyance before opening her eyes. Hermione Granger, now five years old, sighed as she recalled the date. December 22...What'so spec- Oh! It's Phillip's fourth birthday today! Hermione got up and out of bed with a new found excitement as she thought of all the fun she and her little brother would have that day. She hurriedly rubbed her eyes before practically running to the bathroom as the smell of bacon wafted up the stairs. When she returned she quickly pulled on a pair of black jeans and a flowy green shirt before sprinting downstairs. They better have not eaten all the bacon... " MOTHER! FATHER! PHILLY!" Silence greeted her. "Mother... Father?" Nothing. She sighed as she realized that they had left again. As she approached the table she noticed her plate was the only one set, and right next to it was a note. Hermione, We have left for a couple of hours with Phillip to celebrate his birthday. Be a dear and wash the dishes. We have left breakfast ready on the table. Oh, your grandmother should be arriving any minute now. If not, then you'll have to stay alone. - Your Father, Alexander Great. They'd left her. Again. She felt tears welling up in her eyes and fought the urge to cry as she remembered how much her parents blatantly displayed that they preferred her half-brother over her. And it hurt. It hurt a lot. Although Hermione didn't know it, she held a deep resentment towards her family. Towards her stepmother and her father, at least. They made her feel like an outcast, and in some ways, she was. Her mother had died shortly after giving birth to her, and not even a year after her father had gotten with a blonde little French thing, who was now her stepmother and mother of her brother. Hermione looked nothing like them. Her father, while giving her her lime green eyes, had red hair. She supposed she took after her mother, but her father hadn't kept any pictures around for her to confirm this. Her stepmother had sharp gray eyes and golden blond hair and equally golden skin. This left Phillip with dusky blonde hair, tan skin, and green eyes- opposed to Hermione's pale exterior and dark curls. More than that, Phillip had magic . He could make things float towards him when he wanted them most, or shatter every window in the house when he didn't get his way. What more, her parents didn't even reprimand him. No, instead he got hugs and kisses and everything he wanted. Were she to do that, she was sure she'd only get a good lashing. Hermione reached up to wipe sweat away from her cheek. She frowned and wiped again as the wetness didn't disappear. She had to wipe once more before realizing that it was not sweat, but tears. She broke down. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 30 minutes later, a faint pop alerted Hermione that she had visitors. Wiping at her eyes quickly, she turned around and lowered her head respectfully. "Good morning, Madame Granger." She lifted her head curiously as her grandmother's melodious laugh filled the room. "Oh, there's no need for such formalities, love! Now, why have you have been crying?" her grandmother cooed in a soft voice. Even in her later years, Anastasia Granger was a sight to behold. She held herself with such confidence and grace that many would envy. And she had reason to, too! It was obvious that as a young lady she was stunning; with her long red hair and sparkling cobalt eyes. Hermione offered her grandmother a shaky smile before responding, "I have not been crying, Ana." Anastasia snorted before smiling warmly. "Come now, dear. Your eyes are red and puffy. You know nothing gets past this old gal." Hermione nodded jerkily before launching herself into her grandmother's arms and letting out a muffled sob. Hermione's grandmother walked them over to the couch and set Hermione on her lap. Now out of view from the young girl, Anastasia Granger shook her head sadly and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like 'I'm going to kill Alexander.' Anastasia was shaken out of her thoughts when she felt vibrations against her chest. She looked down to see big green, sad eyes staring up at her hopefully. "Sorry Hermy, could you please repeat what you said?" The girl in question scrunched up her nose at the nickname before answering in an exasperated tone. "I saiiiiiiid, can you please tell me a story before Mother and Father return?" "Of course, what of?" Hermione's face grew redder and redder as she answered. "About when you found out you had magic..." Hearing the uncertainty in her granddaughter's voice, Anastasia couldn't help but ask. "Yes, but why? I mean, you have never been interested in this topic before...?" Hermione's response made her blanche and choke on air. "Because...Father... he's disappointed, is he not? That I don't have magic like Philly does?" After hearing this, Anastasia had to choose her words very carefully. She didn't want to lie to Hermione, but she couldn't break her heart like that... "No Hermione... I think Alexander is just scared that you won't have magic, like him." Lie. "Your father loves you very, very much, and he loves Phillip just the same." Double Lie. " In fact, I didn't show my first sign of magic until I was 7, so you should have nothing to worry about, love." The mean little voice in Anastasia's mind didn't stop. Your deception is going to break her, Annie. Something in Hermione's mind told her that her grandmother wasn't telling the truth. Her voice was...off. But she shrugged the thought away. "Do you think... Can you show me some magic?" Ana smiled proudly at the girl's curiosity. "Why not." She furrowed her eyebrows in concentration before smiling brightly. "This, my dear Hermione, is called wandless magic." With a twirl of her hand, she made a lime green rose appear out of thin air. She plucked the rose from the air and gently handed it to Hermione. "A beautiful rose to match your beautiful eyes." Hermione blushed at the compliment and murmured a quiet 'thank you' as she examined the rose. "Curious...This magic wasn't mentioned in the books in Father's office." Anastasia scowled at the thought of Hermione being exposed to the dark tomes that had been passed down in her family. "Yes well, er... See, Hermione, magic isn't just spells . What I did was a form of elemental transfiguration. Basically, I can conjure things without a wand if my intent is strong enough." Hermione's opened her mouth in an o of understanding. Her eyes began to sparkle as they always when she had new information to share. "I read somewhere that that's 'Gamp's Laws of Lemental Transfigation' and- "Elemental Transfiguration, dear." She narrowed her eyes at her Grandmother for interrupting her. "Yes, that, and that an exception is food! You can duplicate food or summon it, but you ca- Hermione was interrupted once again as the rest of her family arrived. Loud laughter met her ears and she jumped off of her Grandam's's lap and began jogging towards her brother, who had now reduced his fit of laughter to little giggles. She slowed to a stop as she and her father made eye contact. The tension in the room steadily rose until it was thick enough to cut with a knife. "What?" Her stepmother made an indignant snort and turned up her nose rather rudely. Her father narrowed his eyes at her and spoke in harsh tones. "What. Was. That." It wasn't a question. It was a threat, and she recognized it as such. Her mind worked a mile a minute and she gulped nervously. "It was... um... a jog?" Her father sneered at her. "A jog, hmm? Turn around and greet us like a proper young lady." Hermione stiffened before walking back. She noticed the worried look on her Grandmother's face but gave her a small smile and a shake of her head as if to say, 'I'm fine. Don't intervene.' By the time Hermione turned around her entire demeanor had changed. Gone was the young girl with the sparkling eyes and constantly flushed cheeks. In her place stood a proper pureblood heiress. Her head was tilted upwards as if to be looking at everything and everyone in disdain. Her back was straightened and she walked forward with as much elegance a five-year-old could posses, and small calculated steps. Once she reached her parents again she bowed her head respectfully. "Father." It was a long moment before her father answered her. "Hermione. Much better, we mustn't make this routine." Her stepmother ignored her. "Of course not, Father." He responded with a 'hmph'. "I'll see to it that you don't." ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Once they were all seated at the dining table for late lunch (or early dinner.) Hermione asked her father the question that had been bothering since early morning. "Soo... Father, are we eating any type of dessert or tart to celebrate Phillip's birthday?" She didn't dare call her brother 'Philly' in front of her parents. Her father raised a single eyebrow and stopped his meticulous cutting of steak. "And what for? The note I left specified that we were out celebrating your brother's birthday. I am to assume that you read it?" Hermione's cheeks flushed in embarrassment. "Er, of course I read it, it's just... I wasn't there to celebrate with you and I think I should be included..." This time it was her stepmother who spoke. "HA! Zat idea iz completely reedikulous, 'Ermione! Zelebrate twice? I fink not!" Alexander nodded sagely by her side. "Elizabeth is correct. There just isn't enough money for it." Inside, Hermione was seething in anger. Not enough money? Not enough money her arse! She was fairly certain her father could buy 10 mansions if he wanted to. On the outside however, she growing redder and redder. For the first time in a long time, Hermione disrespected her Father. "UGH! That is so unfair! You and your stupid wife can go and... and... GO AND STUFF YOURSELF!" Shocked gasps rang throughout the room as Hermione pushed her seat back and rushed upstairs. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Phillip looked worriedly between his parents and the door his sister had disappeared through. Making a decision, he ran after her. As he put his foot and the first stair, he heard grandma Annie start to berate his father. "Alexander! That was completely uncalled for! How could you exclude that little girl from her own family!" Shaking his head, he continued his journey to his sister's room. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Once he reached his destination and slowly opened the door, he was met with a sight he had never seen before. There, sitting on the floor in the center of her room was Hermione. That wasn't the
