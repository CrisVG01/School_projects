The heart chooses which" "Silence is the most powerful scream" "Sometime silence has more meaning than a thousand words" Another failure One, two, three …he began drifting away feeling his breath constricting. Four, five, six ….if only he could last until he lost count then everything would be okay. Twenty-one, twenty-two …the water was cold around him and he didn't want to open his eyes to see the darkness. Sixty-nine, seventy… his lungs wanted to draw in air desperately and he clenched his teeth denying them. One hundred and ten, one hundred and eleven …he was just on the brink of losing consciousness, his fingers cold and stiff. One hundred and fifty …so that is what drowning felt like… one hundred and ninety . Two hundred…and his legs kicked involuntarily one more time betraying him. He surfaced and when he opened his mouth, he inhaled desperately – clinging onto life again. His hands slapped the water surface as punishment for his repeated failure, and he began coughing and inhaling and coughing again as he swam towards the shore. His hand clenched through the weeds and grasped at the mud to get a hold of something that would help him out of this watery grave. He heard a distant frog croaking through his insistent coughing and felt vomit coming up his throat. Heavy footsteps thundered close by and a deep voice exclaimed "Not again!" Severus pulled his wet and cold body out of the lake and leaned his cheek on the mud closing his eyes. His breath had eased out, but the coughing kept coming and with it the need to empty his stomach. "At it again Professur?" the half giant asked. Severus felt a huge hand landing on his back. Someone picked him up easily and turned him to the side. "Now, spit it all out". Severus pushed the helping hand away and tried to glare at Hagrid, but he failed miserably. He pushed up on his elbow and another coughing fit engulfed him, and with it came all the water he swallowed. Hagrid patted his back and kept his very long hair out of the way "That's it, better out tha' in" Hagrid said as Severus emptied the last drops and fell to the ground, exhausted. "What devil got yeh again?" Hagrid asked and tried to pull him to a sitting position. Something that Severus denied by pushing the huge palm away and lying down. "Yeh won't speak, righ'?" Severus shook his head dejected and closed his eyes. He wanted to turn and tell Hagrid to fuck off, but he opted to keep his mouth sealed. Instead he winced and turned his back to the half giant while trying to get a good footing in order to stand up. "Righ', I'm callin' Charity," Hagrid said and Severus managed a swift turn that made him dizzy. "NO!" He croaked with an unused voice that barely resembled his own. A strong shudder run through his spine when he heard that abhorrent sound in place of his deep, impressive voice. Tears pricked his eyes and he closed them trying to push back the need to cry. His palm landed protectively around his neck, where Nagini had torn his skin, and with it his vocal chords, four years ago. His fingers traced the fabric of the turtleneck to make sure that he was covered and then he gestured at Hagrid to go away. "Yeh know I am not leaving yeh. Come on, let me help yeh up." Hagrid grabbed his arm and, before Severus had the chance to react, pulled him up. Severus glared at him threateningly, pulled his arm away, and staggered to a safer distance. "Yeh sure yeh won' let me call Charity?" Hagrid repeated. Severus raised a finger at him and looked at the giant man warningly, but didn't open his mouth again. The loss of his voice was only one of the many things the war took away from him, but not the most important. Still, he didn't want to listen to himself if he could help it. He missed the voice that had served him so well prior to the war. Especially when he needed to control his emotions and the emotions of everyone around him. He had mastered the manipulation of his old voice. He knew how to change its pitch in order to elicit fear and respect. Now he was left with an insufferable croak to express himself with. The loss was almost unbearable. I guess that's as good a punishment as any, he thought. Inside his mind his voice still held that velvety thickness that made students quiver in their shoes when it was used against them. Inside his head, it still held that respectful weight in its depth that made foes and allies alike keep their distance. He heard a branch behind him crack suddenly and he closed his eyes. He tried to draw back the magic that escaped him unwillingly in his emotional breakdown. "Professur, yeh are doin' it again," Hagrid said and took a couple of steps back. I know you bloody fool , he thought and clenched his teeth and fists, pulling back the magic that was flowing around him. Hagrid looked at the thick branch behind Severus and saw it bend as if some invisible arm was pulling it down. "Charity can help yeh, let me get 'er please!" he said. Severus opened his palm and shook his crooked fingers with rage in front of Hagrid. He mouthed an expressive "NO " and kept on trying to control his magic from breaking the branch. Suddenly, the branch was released from his telekinetic grip and shot upwards, shedding a rain of leaves down to them. Hagrid signed in obvious relief. "Thank the Gods!" Severus staggered back a couple of feet and leaned his back on the bark of the tree closing his eyes. He had denied himself the ability to control magic through a wand four years ago when he had awoken from a coma, deciding to live like a squib. However, being unable to control the jolts of magic that escaped him when he was emotionally overburdened was not a side effect he had counted on. The longer he continued to not use magic, the larger effect he had on the world through the suppressed force within him. Not that this loss was the biggest he suffered in that war, either. He gestured at Hagrid to go away and covered his eyes. His wet clothes weighed heavy on his thin frame. He was trembling slightly. "All right, yeh don' wan' Charity. Wan' ter come ter me house for a bevvy? It will help warm yeh up." Hagrid suggested with a warm smile under his huge beard. Severus shook his head in denial and pushed away from the tree, intending to walk back to the damned school and bury himself in his small chamber behind the main library. It was dead of night, so he was not needed to be on post yet. He still had a good six hours before he would have to get up and open the library doors for the staff. Another two days until the school would open it's gates to the new and old dunderheads once again. Two steps down the path and a wave of vertigo overran him. Two huge hands grabbed him and kept him up. He pressed his lips together in frustration and pushed Hagrid away one more time. "Yeh can barely stand. Come with me, or I go fer Charity. Or worse – fer Minerva." Hagrid warned. Severus bared his teeth and offered him a deadly glare as he turned around and walked in front of Hagrid towards the man's wooden cabin. He didn't want to worry Charity, and he didn't want Minerva to bother with him at all. The shame of having to work on parole at the school was enough of a burden. As if anyone had given him a proper choice at that. It was either this or undergoing a trial – possibly facing a sentence in Azkaban. His freedom could have been deemed the biggest loss of the war…but no, that was not it either. Minerva asked him to be a Professor again, but he adamantly denied. Silently, he had ordered a quill to write on parchment, telling her that he would either take Filch's old job as Caretaker, or work in the apothecary. That was the last bit of magic he used. He requested that his job did not include extensive interaction with either staff or students. Minerva gave him the position of Study Hall overseer and Librarian since Madam Irma Pince had retired after the war. "There we are, see? Tha' was not so difficult righ'?" Hagrid said behind his back. Severus looked up at the well known cabin Hagrid had managed to build again after it was burned down before the war. The half giant overtook him easily and unlocked the door, beckoning him inside. The raw smell of meat and hot fire attacked his sensitive senses and he winced. "Come in!" Hagrid smiled and Severus walked in feeling defeated on all fronts. He strode warily towards the fireplace and dumped himself on the floor cross legged, he had no strength left to refuse Hagrid's help. He was shivering from the cold and from the shock, and now his empty stomach was rumbling noisily. "Make yerself comfortable. Care fer a bevvy?" Hagrid asked as he took off his heavy coat and dropped onto his threadbare easy chair. Fang yawned, got off the lounge, and walked lumberingly towards Snape. He head-butted his shoulder and then plopped himself next to him. Severus looked at him sideways and raised his hands to warm them by the fire. He nodded at Hagrid, feeling completely wasted. Another attempt to take his life had turned into a failure. He was not brave enough to manage that task. He had tried to kill himself by using potions, by drowning, and by jumping off a cliff. In each case his subconscious had taken over and saved him, extending his tormented life. "Got some fire whiskey fer yeh. Drink it slow." Hagrid offered him a wooden mug that was filled to the brim with strong alcohol. He reached out and took it with a trembling hand. Some of it spilled on Fang's back who looked up to Severus, uninterested. He closed his eyes and nodded a silent thank you as he tasted the liquor carefully. The first sip ran down his throat and warmed him up pleasantly. He sighed and raised the mug again, taking large gulps, not caring how quickly he was downing it. When there were only a few drops left at the bottom, he lowered it and inhaled with his eyes closed. Slowly, he felt his fingertips and toes warming up. "I said drink it slow! Tha's not wha' yeh did!" Hagrid chastised him. "No." He mouthed and shook his head. He placed the almost empty mug next to him and pulled off his muddy boots and wet shocks. He placed them next to the fire with ridiculous care and brought his feet closer to the heat to warm them. "Yeh want me ter bring yeh a blanket?" Hagrid asked and sat down next to him. The floor of the cabin shook considerably. He shook his head in denial
