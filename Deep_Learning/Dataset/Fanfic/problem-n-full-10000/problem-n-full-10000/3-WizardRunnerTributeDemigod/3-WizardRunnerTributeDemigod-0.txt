I felt the stitch in my side and smiled. That was just the pain I was chasing. And the feeling of my body burning. The concrete underneath my feet, and the park zipping past me. It was all fine until I rain smack dab into a chest. This sent me sprawling. I cringed at the feeling of my skin grinding grinding against the pavement. I could feel warm blood seep from my cuts. My eyes remained close. I attempted to rise, but a heavy force pinned me down. I peeked through my eyelashes, the way kids do during a game of groundies, and internally groaned at the sight of a man pinning me down. I had enough of them at the current moment. The guy gave no sign if moving, "Um, can you get off of me?" I squeaked, very unlike me. This snapped him out of his daze and he murmured something I couldn't catch. He sat back and let me sit up. He moved his face up and I gasped. I was met with the most attractive eyes. They were a brilliant sea green, with this mischievous and boyish sparkle. "Oh my god, you're bleeding" He scrabbled over to me to get a closer look. He reached out and touched the raw skin and I hissed. He looked at me apologetically, and stood. He stuck his hand out, "C'mon." I was uneasy, but I took his hand anyway, "Huh?" "I'm taking you back to my place" As I opened my mouth to protest he quickly added, "You're injured, and it's the least I can do. I did plow you over" He rubbed the back of his neck, and gave me a crooked grin. "How do I know you won't just rape me? Or murder me?" I let go of his hand, just now realizing I was still holding it. He still had the crooked grin in his face, "I swear I will do nothing. I swear on my Mom. And that's a pretty big deal." I couldn't find a way to say no. I nodded, even though every sane nerve in my body urged me to turn away. "I'm Percy by the way," He said in between small talk. I smirked, "Just Percy?" "Well I was going to introduce myself like James Bond" He-Percy shrugged, "That would've been much better." I nodded He looked at me, "Do over?" I nodded again. "I'm Jackson. Percy Jackson" He made sure to seriously flip his shaggy black hair out of his eyes "I give it a 10. Even better with the bieber hair flip" I laughed "Hey, I've been flipping my hair a lot longer the bieber" Percy protested, but joined me in laughter shortly afterward. The walk to his place was short and sweet. The building he lived in was run down and cramped between two glossy and large businesses. Bricks were falling out, paint was chipped, but it all made it seem more homey. Percy took a few minutes get the door unlocked, the minutes included him cursing under his breath, switching keys and jiggling multiple keys in the lock. Finally the lock clicked and the door creaked opened. He stepped back "Ladies first" He nodded at me I smiled, "Your Mom has taught you well" He directed me through cramped up hallways, and sharp turns untill he pulled me through in archway into a small kitchen. Without warning, he hoisted me up, rarther easily, into the smudged counter. Percy's hands stood still on my waist, and he heavily blushed, turning his neck bright pink, when he noticed this. He ran a folded washcloth under the tap. "This may sting" He warned before pressing it against my elbow. I winced and choked in sharply. Instinctly I wrapped my hand around his biecp. And did he have quite the muscles. Percy continued tending to my elbow, knee cap and wrist. Whenever I made a noise, Percy would look at me to make sure I was okay. It felt nice to know some one cared. After tending to me, Percy gave me an odd look, "You've seen my house, but you haven't given me your name" "It's Annabeth" {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} My feet pounding against the round was the only sound in Central Park. Birds were once chirping but they stopped, I had better things to worry about then why the birds stopped chirping. Luke wouldn't stop blowing up my phone. How was I supposed to react to my crush of 7 years, boyfriend of 3 and fiance of 1/2 cheating on me with my bestfriend of 10 years? Just brush it off like someone stepped on the back of my shoe? Then for the 2nd time, I was too far into my head and ran into someone for the second time in 3 days. "Oh my God, I can't believe this happened again I'm so sor-Annabeth?" I looked down, I had ended up on top, to see Percy under me. I smiled, "We have to stop meeting like this" "Agreed," He tried moving and grimaced I slid off of him, "Okay, I've hurt you. Let me take you to get a coffee or something." He shook his head "I have the money. My treat." I insisted. Percy stood up and we walked side by side. "So do you never look where you're going?" Percy asked I laughed, a good real laugh,"I do, I've just a lot going on" "Care to talk about it?" He asked very gently. I opened my mouth to talk but realized we had reached the local coffee shop 'Steamers'. I ordered my coffee the way I always drink it, straight black. Percy got some sugary faux coffee drink I glared at him, "What? It's more normal than drinking black coffee" He protested as we sat down. I sipped my coffee, "How come you never look where your going?" "You really want to know?" He gave me a sorrowful stare I nodded "My Dad, who hasn't been in my life since I was crawling, called me up. I'm not even sure how he got my number, but asked me to be the new CEO of his boat and yacht company. It means moving, new job, I'll be one of the snobby CEOs with slicked back and dyed hair. Due to this, my girlfriend-now ex-girlfriend who is an art major and hippie decided upon hearing this wants nothing to do with me. That's the update on the life of Percy Jackson." "I think you should take the job," I took a sip of my coffee, "But, it's your choice. I'm not gonna force you." Percy looked at me and smiled, "Your the first person to say that" {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} I went running again, this time making sure I looked where I was going. I needed a new place to stay. There is no way in hell that I am going to still be living with Thalia, the finace stealer. The morning was cloudy, but most days in New York were. Then I saw him. Percy. He was hunched over, I think tying his shoe. When I round the corner and came closer I noticed his hands cupping a small animal. He heard me and perked his head up. "Annabeth?" He straightened up, revealing a small tan kitten in his hands. I stepped closer I cracked a smile, "First time we didn't plow into each other" "It must be a miracle" He followed my eyes to the small critter, "It was crying and I couldn't just leave it here." "So, you have a soft side for animals" I was now in arms reach of the kitten, I nervously stroked it's soft fur Percy was looking at me though, "I-I took the job, I'm packing up my things. And" He paused, "I'll be needing some help" "I'd love to help." We walked back to his place, I surprisingly knew the way back. His house was even more cluttered with boxes. I picked up a frame. an older woman, with eyes that just seemed ageless, smiled at the camera, a small wrinkled baby in her hands. "Is this you?" I held up the picture so he could see. Percy had busied himself setting the kitten down in a smaller box and fetched a plate of milk. He smiled "Yep. Wasn't I the cutest" I nodded, "Yeah. What happened?" He punched my arm "Just pack." "Ooh. Somebody's getting angry" I taunted. I went for the kitchen, admitting I lost my way around the twisty hallways. I wrapped an array of dusty wine glasses, plastic cups, cracked mugs, and some nice regular cups. I then promoted myself plates, again Percy had quite the collection of things. I was in the middle of finishing up plates and bowls when Luke Bryan blasted through the house. Percy slid in on his socks. "Country?" I asked standing up and dusting of my bare knees. He nodded and grabbed my hands. We ending up dancing, not slow dancing like you would at the Prom, Percy knew had to swing dance. There wasn't any more packing done that morning. {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} I was laughing to heavily to say anything. While dancing, Percy made the stupidest-and cutest, but that was beyond the point-face. "Well. With your help I packed 2 other boxes" He said between chuckles I regained my breath, "I should go, it's getting kinda late." I checked the clock it flashed 8:46. Had I really been here since 9 AM? I made sure to grab my phone of the counter and head towards the door. Percy grabbed my bicep, "Wait, I've got to stop running into you. Can I have your number?" He flashed this troublemaker smile and I couldn't find a way to say no "Yeah, it's ###-###-###, now can I leave?" I watched him fish around in his pockets, seriously guy pockets were way bigger than girl pockets-don't even get me started on those fake pockets, pulled out his phone and typed my number in. He replaced his phone, "Yeah I guess" I opened the creaky door and was greeted with the sight of rain. Thunder boomed and I jumped, Percy lightly laughed "Is Annabeth I-don't-know-your-last-name afraid of a little thunder?" He teased, I laughed along with him. I was a little frightened by thunder. But who really cares? "I cannot walk to my car, maybe 3 miles away in pounding rain in a flimsy tank top and workout shorts" I groaned, what was I do to? Percy had a childish grin on his face, "SLEEPOVER" He squealed girlishly. I laughed, silently accepting the fact I was going to sleep at Percy's house, a guy I kinda knew. We wound up sitting on the floor by the ashy fire place wrapped in blankets, I was a little blushy from Percy's question. EARLIER "C'mon up to my room, let's get blankets." He grabbed my hand, and boy he had those hands that you wish you hold forever. We ran up the thin stairway. Once we picked out our blankets, I settled on a fuzzy quilt with trees, mountains, and bear on it. Percy decided on having his brown thick comforter. The whole room smelled like Percy, that guy smell, the sea, and just something I couldn't put my finger on-but I know I love it. Percy held up dark blue pajama pants and a t-shirt with the words GOODE HIGH SWIM TEAM plastered across the front "Bottom or top?" I blushed crimson, he laughed-a good deep laugh "I'm kidding" He tossed the t-shirt at me and stepped in closet to change. I hesitantly slipped my tank top off, leaving me only in short work out shorts and my sports bra. The shirt was extremely soft, I left my shorts on, just in case. Percy knocked on the door, "You decent?" I unknowingly smiled. There would be lots guys dying to catch a girl changing, Percy on the other hand asked if I was decent. "Yeah, it's safe to come in"
