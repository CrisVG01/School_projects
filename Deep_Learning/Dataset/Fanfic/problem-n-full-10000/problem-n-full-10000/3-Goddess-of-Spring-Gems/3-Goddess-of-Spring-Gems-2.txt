Disclaimer: I don't own PJO. This will probably be in third person's POV most of the time. If anyone thinks that this has ANYTHING to do with my other stores, it doesn't have much to do with them. Not even so much with Rise of Olympus . It also doesn't have much to do with the PJO series. I mean the characters, sure but nothing from the books. Except maybe a few spread out words. I mean- I honestly don't know how to say this but, it's a completely different story. BTW. Hecate's talk with Hazel about the kidnapping about Persephone never happened. A peaceful day in Camp Half-Blood. Too bad it wouldn't last. All of the demigods were in a large field. "I heard that the seven are coming back!" Katie said. A small, but bright FLASH! interrupted her. The Romans stood there, imposing. "What are we doing here?" Dakota asked aloud. "Kill the Greeks!" Octavian charged, only to be interrupted by a flash of light. "Nico?" Gwen asked. "What are you doing here?" "You knew the Romans and you didn't tell us?" Grover asked. "Charge!" Octavian yelled, charging. "Do you always go around charging people like that?" A voice called out. Everyone turned around, trying to find who spoke. "Show yourselves!" Octavian screamed. "You are in no position to order me around." A chilling voice replied. The voice was so cold that it had everyone shivering. Including Chiron who just entered. "What are you doing here, Hades? And why change voices now? You should stop hiding behind the disguise." Chiron called out. The demigods, legacies and Rachel stared at each other. That was Hades? "If I remembered correctly, I am older than you by twenty five or six years. And it's not my fault that some people chose to hate me. Besides, you were the one that hid behind a human form when we were younger." Hades said, taking off his Helm of Darkness. FLASH! The Olympians and the other gods, with Hecate appeared, looking confused. "What are we doing here, punks?" Ares sneered. The Romans bowed to most of the gods. Only Chiron caught the flash of hurt that appeared on Hades' face when the demigods decided to turn from him. "I don't know." Zeus said. "You've finally decided to admit that you're not the smartest, haven't you brother?" Hades glared at them. "What did we do to you?" Demeter sniffed. "Nothing. Absolutely nothing. That's exactly why I'm never fair with my family." Hades yelled, with heavy sarcasm. The demigods looked between them, afraid of the fight when a note appeared. To gods, demigods, legacies, Hecate, and Rachel We will have you reading about someone. Someone that almost all of you hate. Someone that you betrayed and treated unfairly. A god. A book will appear. This will help you understand why he turned so bitter to you. He wasn't always like that. He is a being that is superior to even us, the Fates. From, the Fates and Rhea Zeus stared at everyone. "You don't hate me do you? Because there is no one else that can be more superior than the Fates." "Are you sure, Zeus? I knew the Fates way before you were born. {A/N: Okay, this will be under the rise of olympus.} " Hades said. All of a sudden, the seven, Nico, Reyna and the Hunters appeared. "Kelp head? Death brat? Annie?" Thalia stared at them in disbelief before enveloping them in a bear hug. Or a deer hug. "Thals!" Annabeth said. "Pinecone face!" The two cousins said. The note was read again. "Who do you think it is about?" Hazel asked, glancing at her dad for a second. "I don't know." Hades lied, wincing internally. 'Why me? Couldn't the Fates just have been joking around?' "I highly doubt that." Athena said, looking at him. The gods all sat down. Grover muttered something. He had sensed Hades' emotions and was surprised that he felt panic, among other things but panic was the strongest. Grover didn't realize that he spoke until everyone was staring at him. "Hades is good at controlling emotions. If I was that panicked, then the plants would be restless." "I don't give off life anymore." Hades whispered anymore softly. "I can only kill it." Actually, that was a lie. "Are you sure? I think I've seen you bean Thanatos on the head with some weeds a long time ago." Hecate asked. {A/N: I got this idea of Hecate and Hades being best friends, before I read HoH. So... that small part Hecate said to Hazel doesn't exist, to me. LOL: Hecate, Hades, Hazel, HOUSE of HADES. (H)) "That was millenniums ago!" Hades protested. "Still..." Hecate drawled. "Aren't we supposed to be reading? Then where is the book?" Heracles asked. "How should we know?" Hades snapped. "Well... someones happy." Leo said, sarcasm oozing from his voice. Hazel glared at him. "Look up." Artemis said. As the big idiot he is, Hercules did. And almost died. Why? A book- a really thick one,too- fell on his face. "There it is." Ares said, stating the obvious. "Idiot." Athena muttered. Everyone else snickered. The book morphed smaller. It turned into a bright yellow book, with an icy blue stripe across it. "It doesn't have a cover or title!" Annabeth exclaimed, surprised. "I just realized! Our Roman forms aren't trying to take control!" Poseidon exclaimed. "Of course not. The Fates kept us in control." Hades said. "How do you know this?" Hera asked, narrowing her eyes at her eldest sibling. Hades rolled his eyes. "I'm older than the Fates, did you forget?" He asked, staring at Hera. Hera sniffed and turned, causing Zeus to glare at Hades. "Thanks for upsetting her." Zeus growled. "Right. Blame the evil dude that you betrayed." Hades said. No one caught the bitterness he spoke with. "You aren't evil." Persephone said. Hades half-smiled at her. "Why would you say that? He's the perfect example of evil!" Demeter pointed out. The Olympians nodded. "And you aren't?" Hades whispered. "I think we should start the book." Athena said. "It'll be about me. I have blue eyes and blonde hair. Poseidon and Hades have black hair, Poseidon has sea-green eyes and Hades has black eyes." Zeus said, arrogantly. "I used to have dark and light blonde hair and icy eyes." Hades said. Everyone gaped at him. "Yeah, as if!" Zeus scoffed. "Look at everyone else's reactions!" Hestia shifted slightly. She might not get along with her older brother anymore, but he did help her no matter what. "Actually, Hades did have blonde hair and blue eyes." She said. Hades looked at her, surprised, but smiled. "No he didn't." Zeus growled. "Why don't we just read the book!" Hades threw his hands up in the air, {A/N: sometimes, saying heyy-ohh, gotta let go... (Virtual cookies if you get it (::) (::) (::))} exasperated. "Fine." Zeus huffed. "Drama king." Hades muttered. "Can I read?" Athena leaned forward so much she almost fell on the grass. Hermes laughed. Hades stole the book from over Hercules, looked at the cover, paled and passed it over to Athena. And then buried his face in his hands. "Damn those Fates." He groaned. The others stared at him, wide-eyed. Athena opened the book. Chapter one I know you're looking at the book like, who the Hades is this guy? Or god. Everyone, except Hades and Persephone laughed. Most of them had been thinking this. I suppose the right thing to do is tell you, but. Let's see if you can guess. Hint one: I had dark/light blonde hair and icy blue eyes. Hestia gasped. "Hades." She muttered. Had she really judged him unfairly? The others stared at her. "Who is it?" Athena asked. "Not telling." Hestia replied. Did no one remember how Hades used to look? Hint two: I am not evil. "Umm..." Poseidon trailed off. "Why would anyone go out and say that?" "I have to agree with barnacle beard." Athena said, grudgingly. Hades looked away. Hint three: You won't believe hint two when you know who I am. "Okay. Who has that little self confidence? I mean, most of the gods are big headed, or nice." Artemis wondered. "You really don't know? Isn't it obvious? This person is called evil, but he isn't." Hades snapped, but you could trace the sadness in his voice. "And the note said he was betrayed." Athena stared at him. So did almost everyone else. "So...it's you?" Poseidon asked his brother. "Do you see anyone else being neglected? After looking after all the gods and trying to be peaceful? Noooo... It's me. The Fates told me a while ago." Hades snapped. "Read, Athena." Hint... Oh whatever! You probably guessed. I'm Hades. "See?" Hades asked sourly. "No one said it wasn't you." Zeus said. "I meant that I did have blonde hair and blue eyes." Hades said. "True..." Zeus said reluctantly. "You had blonde hair?" Almost everyone exclaimed. "Yes...?" Hades stared at them. "Did you really forget?" He stared at his siblings. "I have a photo to prove it." "Can I see it?" Hephaestus asked. "Sure." Hades shrugged, pulling a picture out. Everyone crowded around it. In the picture, a fifteen year-old boy with blonde hair and blue eyes was laughing beside a fourteen year-old girl with dark orange hair and brown eyes that was smirking. Then there was a brown haired, brown eyed thirteen year-old girl that was smiling, a black haired, sea-green eyed, grinning twelve year-old. A honey brown haired and honey eyed, dancing, eleven year-old girl with a smiling, ten year-old centaur beside them. With a blonde haired and electric blue eyed, nine year-old boy that scowled. "That's me, Hestia, Demeter, Poseidon, Hera, Chiron and Zeus. In that order." Hades said. "It doesn't look like it." Hazel said, glancing from her dad to the smiling boy in the photo. "Yeah. It took me a lot of betrayals, sadness and experience to change me." Hades said. Some people winced at the casual way he said it. Now, you're probably wondering: Why are we reading this? It's not like we should treat him differently. He's the evil one. Now almost everyone winced when they realized that what Hades said was true. "Exactly. Why should we care?" Hercules sneered. "Besides. You're greek." Octavian spat. "Any you did more wrongs." Zeus said. -Fates & Rhea- The Fates and Rhea, who were watching from a screen, winced. "This is not going well at all." Clotho said, watching her friend getting treated so cruelly by his own siblings. "Poor Hades." Atropos said. -Gods & Demigods, yada yada- "No. You did." Hades said, emotionless. Now, you probably didn't know a lot about me. Even if you think this is the perfect description of me: Evil, mean, kidnapper, lying. And so on. "But you are." Demeter said. "Exactly!" Katie said, staring at her godly half-sister. One: I spent twenty years out in the open before being swallowed. Two: I cared for my siblings the second they came into Kronos' stomach. "You did?" Demeter asked. "I thought you would remember, but yes." Hades replied. Three: This list is not in order. Four: I have a sense of humor. "I highly doubt that." Apollo said. Five: I never abducted anyone. Zeus made that part up about me, as revenge. "Really?" Katie asked Persephone. "Yes." She replied. Six: Umm... Hecate told me to write this and magicked the computer to not erase this part, so it'll print out... I never had 'flings' and didn't lose my... "Can you not say that part?" Hades called out, praying that Athena wouldn't say it. No such luck. "Why?" Athena looked at the book and earned her answer. "Oh." "What is it?" Hermes asked, his eyes sparkling, waiting for blackmail. "I really don't think I've seen you that uncomfortable before." Hecate mused. Hades glared at her. "Read on, Athena." Hermes said, taking out a pen and paper. "Yes. And skip that part." Hades said. Athena hesitated
