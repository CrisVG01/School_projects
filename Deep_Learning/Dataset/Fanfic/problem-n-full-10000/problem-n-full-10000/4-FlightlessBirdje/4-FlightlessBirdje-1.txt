I wrote this for the Maybe-an-HEA-Contest ******************** TAKEN ******************** by Flightlessbirdje April 2015 She was 16 when they moved into the house across the street. Her hair flame red, her skin pale, her eyes bright green and those freckles... She was a total knockout. It was just her and her father, Charlie Swan, an Irish man. Her name sounded to me like heaven: Bella Swan ... I checked her name... It means Devoted to God ... see? Like close to heaven. She ended up in my class so we had two years in school together before we would probably choose a different college. Because I saw her walking to school that first day, I offered her to ride with me. Ever since that day we drove together and sat together in school at lunch break and in class if possible. We became great friends, nothing more... but I loved her anyway. Never not once did we notice the creep watching her... But he did notice us... Later we would find out he had been watching her since day one. I can still get angry at myself for it. If one of us had seen him... Maybe nothing would have happened. You know that question 'What if?' Yeah, ever since the day he took her I have been playing that guessing game. It was a typical Summer evening... Bella just turned 18 three weeks earlier. I wasn't home that day, I was at my Summer job, saving for college. Her dad was fishing with my dad, my mom was home. Bella had the day off and for what we now know stayed at home. Twilight was arriving and Bella had talked on the phone with her dad about what they should eat for dinner. Next thing we know, Bella was gone. Her purse, her wallet, her phone, her ID… All her important stuff were still at home. In the garden was her chair with a book next to it, abandoned. Lemonade on the counter in the kitchen, waiting for the sugar to be put in. her glasses on the table... All that was missing was her. The door to the garden stood open, no traces of a struggle or a break in. Just an eerie quietness. Charlie came home at 8 pm. Just like always... and thought she might be with my mom, it was a neighbourhood where you could leave your door open and go visit next door without having to be worried You didn't need to lock your door at night. That changed since that day, no more trust, no more peace... At 8:30 pm. Charlie called my mom, asking to send Bella home for dinner only to find out she was not there. He checked the house again, maybe he had missed her or overlooked a note saying that she went out. When he didn't find one, he called me at my work asking if I knew where Bella could be. Nobody had seen Bella since that morning. A hour later we all sat at the table, cops questioning us about Bella and her life. A file about her gone missing was made up, posters were made and a huge search party was organized. In spite of all the efforts there was no clue about where Bella could be. The police thought it was strange too and send out an alert nation wide. We didn't sleep that night, nor the following night. Bella had just vanished into thin air. Charlie was a shell of the person he once was. So was I. Two weeks had come and gone, but no sign of Bella. My mom made me go back to school after the first week. I was there psychically but my mind wandered off.. Bella where are you? Are you alright? Did they hurt you? So many questions, so little answers. I lost a lot of weight, I couldn't eat or sleep well knowing she was out there somewhere but not knowing what was happening to her. Everywhere I looked I saw her face, heard her laugh, caught her scent. If I closed my eyes at night she was the one I saw, only to wake up in sweat and panic. Where could she be? ********************Taken******************** Dear me, How can I tell you how I feel, I have no clue if it is daytime or nighttime. I have no window and only a light in this room. It is cold and it smells. I woke up here, a chain connects me to the wall. There is a bed, a toilet and a sort of shower. I get one meal every so many hours. The person who holds me here doesn't talk or shows his face. For now I haven't been done any harm.. but I can feel it coming. Like it is in the air. Please help me through this. I miss my dad, Edward the boy who secretly stole my heart.. he lives across the street from me. I miss his parents, they are so sweet to me and my dad. Oh no... I can hear him coming... ******************** Taken ******************** The police came to the house again, Charlie wanted us with him. They had nothing new. They do what they can... but there isn't much. The person who took Bella didn't leave one clue so it seems to be going cold. I got mad, angry at the world. Bella vanished a month ago and they can't help us anymore. Charlie just cried, do you know how hard it is to watch a grown man cry? His heart is pulled out of his chest and then burned to ash... He still isn't able to work, his boss told him to come back in two weeks or else he needs to find a new job. The world is hard. Time goes by, we stand still. I miss you Bella, we all miss you. Be safe please. Come home. ********************Taken******************** I feel awful, my body hurts, I am black and blue... I think he broke my wrist. What did I do to deserve this? I can't cry anymore, I know it won't help and I lose fluids because of it.. My food and water supply is low.. I know it could be worse... I only get beatings, for now? I don't know... Do they still search for me? Did they give up hope? Do they miss me as much as I miss them? Did he hurt them too? Oh Please let them be safe. ******************** Taken ******************** It has been three months now and I am beginning to lose hope.. Will I ever see her again? If I ever see her again, I tell her how much I love her. How much I missed her, her laugh, her eyes, her touch, her smell...her. The police are still searching, but with only a few agents. At school the other kids are getting back to normal life.. How do they do that? Kids are back playing outside... the birds are singing their songs... My heart stopped beating...I stopped breathing… It feels like I can't breathe until she is back. ********************Taken******************** Help! Is there anybody out there? I need help. ******************** Taken ******************** Yesterday the cops arrested a man, we don't know much more. They told Charlie he was arrested and might know more about Bella. Please let it be true. It has been five months They searched Charlie and Bella's neighbor's house. It is sealed off. We haven't seen him for a while now. Is he the man they arrested? The police called Charlie and asked him to come to the station. My dad went with him, mom and I are waiting for them to come back. Suddenly a lot of police cars and ambulances are in the street. My mom and I run outside. They go back into the house from the neighbor. What will they find? What or who are they searching for? ********************Taken******************** It has been so long since James has brought me food and water. I am so hungry and thirsty. I can't stop shaking I faint and wake up more frequent. Please find me. Please… ********************Taken******************** Then we hear lots of screaming. The medics are summoned inside the house. Please let it be Bella, let her be alive. My knees stop working and I fall on the street. My mom sits next to me. We cry, we hope, we even start praying. Hoping for our Bella. The door opens and the medics come out...with a stretcher... and then I see her.. Bella! She looks so tiny.. I rush to her, but I am being stopped by a cop. "Bella..Bella" I scream.. I cry... "Is she alive? Tell me... is she alright?" I beg. I hold hope because it isn't a body bag... My mom stands by the ambulance... I run to her... She talks to the police officer, we can't ride with the ambulance... but he is willing to take us to the hospital. Dad and Charlie are being brought there too. ********************Taken******************** Dear me, I hear them, my angels. They let me know it is over, they captured James, they want to bring me to the hospital, my dad will be there too, he never stopped looking for me, I can finally breath again... I let go of my pain and the darkness takes me into his waiting arms. ******************** Taken ******************** We have been in the hospital for four days, Bella has been beaten and neglected.. but the bruises and broken bones will heal. They don't know how she will recover mentally... Today was the day I got to see her, she asked for me. She looked so tiny, I cried, I held her hand, her eyes lost their shining. She looked like her spirit was broken. Bella lost her brightness. I told her I loved her, that I never stopped looking for her. That I will be there for her, always. I'll wait for her. She smiled a very tiny smile, it filled my heart.. made it beat again. There was still a sparkle of herself there. She will survive, we will survive. ******************** Taken ******************** I am alive, I am free, I am safe. I will heal, I will trust again, I will be 'me' again. He told me he loves me, that he never stopped looking for me, he missed me. He cried for me, he held my hand, he will wait for me. I hope someday I can tell him I love him too. I'll fight this for him, I'll be strong again, I will. ******************** Taken ******************** The official rapport is shown to Charlie and dad today.
