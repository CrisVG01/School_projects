' Thoughts – Mind Speech' "Normal Speech" Prologue: Self-Discovery January 31, 1888 It was time. Thirteen year old Perseus felt it in his bones that he had proven himself worthy of receiving additional training from his Patron and his adoptive mother. As he focused his shadow traveling powers on Central Park leaving Hunterdon County New Jersey, the young demigod smiled warmly as he remembered the first time he had met her. ***Flashback, Three years earlier, Central Park NYC*** It had been eleven long months since the beginning of February, when Perseus Achilles Andreíos had escaped the living nightmare that was the orphanage. The abuse that he had gone through there, both physical and sexual, had hardened him, and yet at the same time, helped forge a sense of justice within himself. The ten year old boy had managed to survive by hiding in Central Park at night, and scavenging for food and water sometimes successfully, other times not so much. Having managed to survive as long as he had had been due in part to his abilities that he had discovered by accident, back when he was only eight. Percy had been scavenging for food near the park when he found himself cornered by a drunken homeless man. The older man had been quite irate, and had somehow managed to shatter a bottle of rum and was swinging it at him drunkenly. Having been a target of the woman who had run the orphanage and her drunken rages before, Perseus had become rather adroit at avoiding and dodging any drunken assaults, and his abilities served him well until he slipped on the ice. Falling on his butt, the young boy lost his focus on the threat in front of him and was dazed momentarily from the pain. As he looked back up and saw the man in front of him with the broken bottle swinging down at him, he felt a pull in his gut and raised his right hand instinctively to try and protect himself. With his eyes shut tightly as he braced himself for a world of hurt, Percy opened his eyes to see what looked like a frozen circle of water forming in front of him out of the melted snow around him. Grasping at straws, the boy quickly willed the water in front of him to harden and then braced it to take the hit. It wouldn't be until much later that he recognized the design of the water was in the shape and form of a shield, which had the vague outlines of ancient Greek and Roman origin. Percy had managed to make quick work of the man, knocking him out and making his escape. For the past two years he had been experimenting with this newfound ability, testing it, trying to improve his control and expand his capabilities with it. As it stood at the moment, he was limited to healing and forming a shield with water, as well as forming a spear and projectiles that were more lie crossbow bolts than arrows, but that seemed to be just the beginning of his abilities with water. Over the next several weeks following that particular incident, he had started to notice a lot of strange creatures that started showing up in the area, and they all seemed to be rather odd and dangerous. The worst part of it all was the fact that over the years Perseus had noticed an increase in their numbers and types. So far as the young demigod was aware at this point in time, he seemed to be the only one who could see them, which worried him quite a bit. Then they finally managed to catch up to him one night, late in the month of January, in the year 1885. As usual, Perseus had been keeping a close eye on his surroundings as he got ready to find a place to sleep for the night. He had been rubbing his chest, as many of the scars that he had hurt in the winter chill, when he noticed that the wildlife in the area went silent. Cautiously looking around while doing his best to look like he was staring at the stars, he counted three of the evil looking dogs from behind him and what looked to be another two on either side. Cursing mentally, he knew that he might not make it through this encounter, as it had become blatantly obvious that they were after him, not to mention the fact that food was rather scarce at this particular point in time. While he slowly sped up the pace, the young boy checked his environs to see what he had to work with and saw a small stream the he knew fed into a nearby stream. As anyone who has been through harsh circumstances, experience is one of the cruelest, harshest, yet most thorough teachers there happen to be in existence. Perseus knew he had a fifty/fifty shot at this and that was only if he timed it just right. Angling towards the pond, the demigod counted off the distance in his head before he felt something in his mind click and he took off running. Ignoring the howl of the hellhounds behind him, he started reaching deep inside him for his powers, and focused on an image in his mind as got closer to the body of water. Once he was nearly there, Percy spun on his heel and threw his hands forward straight from the hip towards the two hellhounds that were currently mid leap. After two years of practicing every opportunity that he got, he had gotten as far as forming crossbow bolts of water that he was able to freeze mid-flight, and he could currently form four dozen of them in one shot. Sending a prayer to whoever was listening, he angled them as best he could and let fly. Elsewhere in Central Park, just minutes earlier… The night was chill and the skies above were cloudless, showcasing the moon and the stars in all their glory. The Protogenoi Nyx smiled slightly as she walked along talking with her consort and husband Erebos, as it had been quite some time ago that they had noticed a source of power in this area and were quite intrigued by who or what it might be. As they were walking along, hidden by the Mist from prying eyes, they both felt a pulse of power, which came from a rather powerful demigod somewhere ahead in the distance. Turning to look at each other, they nodded and flashed in the direction that the powers came from. Reappearing mere meters away from the target, they were astounded to find a nine or ten year old boy with raven black hair, sea green eyes, and a firmly set jaw facing off against five hellhounds. Stunned they could only watch as he sent multiple six inch long, inch wide bolts, all made from water that he froze as he called the water forth from the nearby pond. The bolts angled upwards and targeted the throats and chests of the two hellhounds that were in mid-jump, piercing them and killing them causing them to fade away into golden dust as they reached the boy. The young demigod was winded, as he hadn't had a decent meal in a couple of days, and his momentary pause cost him dearly. As he was looking down at the dust swirling at his feet, attempting to catch his breath, Perseus was unaware of the other three hellhounds closing in on him, as well as the three others that were attempting to circle around to get at his flanks. His hard earned and honed battle instincts kicked in at that point, just in time for him to look up and attempt to dodge the incoming paw that was aimed at crushing his skull in one blow. Too late, he felt the burning pain of the near miss, as three claws raked the left side of his face, cutting almost to the bone and barely missing his left eye. It took every last ounce of his will not to scream out in pain at this, as he focused on forming a shield of ice that he swung at the neck of the beast in desperation. Catching the beast by surprise, Percy managed to stun the beast for a second, but that was long enough for him to call upon his powers to form a spear that he thrust through the beast's eye. Getting back into a very rough, but well-practiced stance with his spear and shield, the demigod legacy of Poseidon took stock of his situation and realized he was well and truly screwed. Even though they were quite surprised by the tenacity and rough level of skill the young boy had, both of the Protogenoi were also impressed with his level of awareness and his potential as a hero was limitless. From the clothes that he wore they could tell that he had been on his own for quite some time, and he had obviously fought monsters off before. Blinking his eyes, Perseus faked a quick swipe across his left eyebrow to make it seem like he was at least partially blinded by the blood, when the two beasts in front of him made their move. The one on his left was the first one to go, as he waited until the last possible second to slam the edge of his shield against the neck, forcing it to the ground from their combined momentum, and a thrust of his spear finished it. Knowing that he was almost at his limit, his senses flared, alerting him of danger to his rear. In desperation, and an adrenaline fueled last-ditch effort, he dropped his spear and focused. As he did so, the edges of his shield became much sharper, and he swung around with the shield held on his left arm while braced with his right. Letting go of his restraint, he yelled out his rage and frustration at possibly dying here, and allowed every last ounce of his unleashed emotion to fuel this effort. Spinning in place, Perseus managed to catch the Hellhound in its exposed throat, slicing through the flesh and bone, leaving the head dangling by a few small slivers of skin. Totally exhausted, the boy dropped to his knees, accepting his fate, as he collapsed to the ground. Nyx and Erebos stood there, shocked speechless as the young boy, in an adrenaline induced burst of strength, sheared through the neck of the hellhound almost completely before collapsing to his knees, and from there to his side. Shaken from her temporary stupor, she walked out from behind the cover of the trees and waved a slim white hand at the two remaining beasts, causing them to explode. Gently approaching the young demigod, she knelt down and slowly rolled him onto his back, cradling his head in her lap. Brushing his hair ever so softly out of his eyes, the Goddess smiled down at him kindly as she watched young Perseus open his eyes and look up at her. "What is your name little one?" Blinking his eyes, he swallowed thickly as he responded before passing out from exhaustion. "Perseus Achilles Andreíos…Milady…" ***Flashback Ends*** Central Park, NYC Popping into the clearing where he had slain his first monster, Perseus stayed within the shadow and ensured that he was unseen by any mortals. True he could utilize the Mist and ensure that they saw nothing that they weren't supposed to, but this way was far easier and simpler. As his mother had taught the simplest means were more often the best and most effective ones. After having made certain that he was indeed alone, he made his way out of the shadows and
