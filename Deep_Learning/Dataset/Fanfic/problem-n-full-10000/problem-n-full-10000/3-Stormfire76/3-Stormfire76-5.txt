Disclaimer: I don't own Percy Jackson and the Olympians, or Heroes of Olympus. Part I Percy and Annabeth were still alive, at least. Leo hung onto that thought as he stared through the Doors of Death at them. Monsters surrounded his friends, stretching out for miles beyond his view. The only thing protecting them was one of Percy's signature hurricanes, but Leo had no idea where the son of Poseidon was getting the water to make a barrier that powerful, let alone the strength. He and Annabeth looked completely exhausted. There was no time to waste. "Can you guys climb out of there?" he yelled. Percy lifted his head. The guy had always looked alive and full of energy – a little like Leo himself – but now his eyes were dim. He shook his head. "Pull . . . of Tartarus . . . too strong . . ." he managed to shout. "Okay!" Then Leo turned to his friends. "I'll be right back," he told them. "If any monsters break through Percy's hurricane . . . I don't know. Just stop them somehow." "What are you going to do?" Hazel asked him. But Leo was already running out of the House of Hades. The Argo II was waiting right outside. Leo didn't hesitate for a second; he just hopped onto the rope ladder and started climbing. Once he reached the deck, he ran downstairs into his cabin, where he had laid out supplies, just in case. He stuffed three bottles of water, a canteen of nectar, and about twenty granola bars into his tool belt. Then he strapped a Celestial bronze sword to his waist and rushed to the helm. "Does it work?" he asked Festus anxiously. "The project ?" Festus's teeth clicked and whirred. Of course it does. Leo breathed a sigh of relief. "Good. All right, then. Festus, we're going inside!" The dragon clicked and whirred some more. "Yes, through the doors," Leo said impatiently. "What did you think? No, I don't care if you have to break the doorframe a little. We need to get in there!" Festus must have picked up on Leo's urgency. Without another protest, he turned towards the doors. Leo toggled the control stick on his Nunchuk and shook his Wii remote. The Argo II zoomed towards the House of Hades, and with a crack that must have echoed through all of Greece, it shoved its way inside. "Leo!" the others shouted in amazement. "What are you doing ?" Leo didn't waste time with words. He just tilted his Wii remote and yanked a couple levers, so that the ship faced the Doors of Death head-on. The pull of Tartarus was pretty strong, even from this distance, but the ship was unfazed. Leo had been counting on that. "Percy! Annabeth!" he yelled. "I'm going to get you guys out of there! Just hold on!" Annabeth was barely conscious, and all of her remaining strength was focused on keeping her hand plastered to her shoulder so that as little blood as possible leaked out. Percy looked just as bad off, if not worse – his injury was at his side, not his shoulder – but he somehow managed to hear Leo. He squinted through the pain and saw the bronze dragon figurehead. "No, Leo!" he shouted. "You can't get us both! The Doors have to be closed from both sides! I have . . . to stay behind!" Percy didn't want to be stuck in Tartarus forever – he'd been waiting for his happily-ever-after with Annabeth for too long – but he also didn't want anyone else to be. If Leo pulled him out now, Percy knew he wouldn't be brave enough to go back to Tartarus a second time by choice. But the Doors had to be closed. This was the only way. "What was that?" Leo asked. "I can't hear you, Percy! It's too loud!" In reality, Leo had heard Percy just fine. He was just choosing to ignore his words. Percy's hurricane was starting to die out. The first monsters were slipping through the cracks, and Leo knew that as soon as one got to them, Percy and Annabeth would be finished. So he didn't wait another second. He punched a couple buttons and muttered a couple commands. A giant grabber arm shot out of the hull just underneath Festus and pushed all the way to Tartarus. Leo's tongue stuck out as he frowned in concentration. "A little to the right," he muttered. "Farther . . . No, not that far . . ." He knew he only had one chance to get this right. Another try, and the monsters would be on top of them. "Come on, come on. . . . And . . . Perfect!" He flicked a switch, and the claws closed around his friends. He punched the air in excitement. "Yes! Now, reverse! And gently deposit cargo on the deck!" He shouted commands at Festus and pulled levers like a madman. By the time he was done, Percy and Annabeth were lying on the deck, his other friends were climbing the rope ladder to get to them, and Leo had secretly made a few adjustments to the steering mechanisms. "Annabeth! Percy! Are you guys okay? Oh my gods, what happened to you?" Piper was babbling as she ran to them and took in their injuries. "I'll get you some nectar right away. Ambrosia too. Just a second . . ." "Already done, Pipes," Jason interrupted, handing her a canteen. "And here's water," Hazel added breathlessly, coming up from belowdecks. "I'm sure you guys need it. Food can come later, once you're stronger." The others fussed over the pair, but Leo stood back nervously, eyeing the Doors of Death. They weren't closing. In fact, they seemed to be widening . Nico was noticing the change too. He spoke up. "Guys, we have a problem." He nodded towards the Doors. Percy's hurricane had completely dissipated, and monsters were streaming through. "I'm on it," Leo said quickly. "Festus, breathe fire." The dragon obeyed, shooting a stream of flames so hot that the monsters instinctively retreated, even those immune to fire. As soon as Leo was sure that they were safe for the moment, he ran to Percy and Annabeth. But not to comfort them. The others would have plenty of time for that later. "Percy," he said. "Can monsters die in Tartarus?" "Leo!" Piper said. "Why are you interrogating them? They're barely conscious!" "I have to know," Leo said shortly. He turned back to Percy. "Well?" "No," the son of Poseidon croaked. "They . . . get transported . . . to other parts . . . sometimes. . . . But never die." "Okay. Can demigods?" Percy coughed out a weak imitation of laughter. "I . . . don't know. . . . I . . . never tried . . . to find out." "Fair enough," Leo said. "Now what do I need to close the Doors?" Slowly, the others seemed to realize what Leo was planning. "Leo . . ." Hazel whispered. "Why do you have a sword? You never use a sword." Leo kept his eyes on Percy. "What do I need to close the Doors?" The older demigod looked at him, and his eyes focused. "No, man . . ." he croaked. "You can't . . ." "Don't tell me what I can and can't do!" Leo shouted. His hair was starting to smoke, and he didn't bother putting it out. "Just tell me how to close the Doors!" Percy hesitated. "You . . . It's not fair . . ." "Life isn't fair, Jackson," Leo said. He couldn't believe he was being so cross with such a legendary camper, but he really didn't have any time to waste. For one thing, he wasn't sure how long he could hold his resolve. For another, it was only a matter of time before the monsters came through again. Percy shook his head and closed his eyes. "Fine . . ." he said. "You can . . . use fire . . ." "Good. That's all I needed to know." Leo looked at Nico. "You'll close them topside?" Nico's eyes were unreadable, but his voice wavered when he spoke. "Leo. . . . You don't understand what it's like in there . . ." "I do," Leo said. "It's horrible, and I might not make it out alive. In fact, I probably won't. I get it. Now, will you close the Doors topside or what?" "Of course I will," he sighed. Leo looked at Frank. "You guys will be happy together," he said simply. It was the only way Leo could think to apologize for screwing with their relationship by looking like Sammy. Hazel's eyes watered. "Leo . . ." she whispered. "You don't have to . . ." "But I do," he told her. He looked at the others. "Be safe. I'll meet up with you guys in time for the final battle . . . hopefully. If I don't . . . Well, kick Gaea's butt for me." Piper ran to him and threw her arms around him. "Leo . . ." Somehow, she thought, this was almost worse than when Percy and Annabeth fell. This time, everyone felt like they were letting it happen. It wasn't right. Leo disentangled himself. "Okay, okay, Pipes!" he said. "I'm going now!" He glanced at all of his friends one last time, refusing to let himself tear up. He couldn't think of any words, so he just nodded at them. "Nico, climb into the grabber arm," he said to the son of Hades. "What?" "The pull of Tartarus is crazy-strong," he told him. "You can't resist it and close the Doors at the same time. The grabber arm will keep you safe." Nico hesitated. "But you . . ." Leo shrugged. "The Doors can't close if there's a metal claw in the way. Stop arguing, Nico. Just get into it." Finally, everyone seemed to accept that this was happening. They stared at him in shock as he ran to the helm and steered Nico in front of the Doors. Then he hurried to the rope ladder and took the rungs three at a time. The first monster had just breached the entrance. "I'll see you later!" he shouted up at the crew, not sure if his words were lost in the general commotion. "It'll be fine!" He didn't believe that himself, but he wanted to give the others hope. As soon as his feet touched the ground, the pull of Tartarus sucked him through the Doors. "Leo!" Piper's piercing scream shot through all the other noise. The rest of the crew just stared, dumbfounded, as Leo struggled to his feet. He was almost exactly in the spot where Percy and Annabeth had been moments ago. He turned and sent an arc of flames towards the other monsters. It was shaped just like Percy's hurricane, and acted like the same temporary barrier. Leo wasn't sure if that was a good or bad sign. "Are you ready?" he shouted to Nico. The son of Hades nodded. "Then let's do this!" Leo put his hand on one of the Doors and felt the mechanism. Percy was right. It would take the incredible power of searing white fire to force this Door to meet its partner again, just like it had taken a different incredible power to open the Doors in the first place. Leo figured that, from the nature of the lock, Percy probably could have closed it if he had sent the power of a hurricane into its gears. But then Percy and Annabeth would be stuck in here, exhausted, injured, and without supplies. Leo would be stuck in here once he was done, but at least he would be full of energy, uninjured, and stocked with the things he'd stuck in his belt. Hopefully. If Jason
