The rating is what it is for adult language and banter, some UK profanity / slang and implied sexual innuendo. I do not write blow-by-blow smut. Author's disclaimer : This story is based in the world created by J. K. Rowling, she owns all legal rights to the characters, setting, etc. - I am merely borrowing the contents of the JKR world for my own amusement and that of my few readers. In other words…her characters…my plot…savvy? Alternate Universe at times Bless me readers for I have sinned. Usually when I dig deep into my collection of golden oldies (when we could copy or favorite HP tale) I would; when making a remake ask permission in advance to redo the tale I' redoing, Can do that this time … so if anyone knows who wrote (the Lies I've told) originally could you get him/her to let me know if this is ok. I do NOT want to plagiarize; I want to give full credit to the original author, for the inspiration. so please HELP? 88**88 ** Roll film** Hermione's POV 88**88 I've told some pretty big lies in my lifetime. I always prided myself on being an honest person, so I was amazed at how easily I could lie, especially when in danger. (For example) " They were looking for me … I went looking for the troll because I thought I could deal with it on my own, " I told that to Professor McGonagall, losing five house points and gaining two friends in the process. - One of them was the famous Harry Potter and the other was an easy going … fool 88**88 I lived years without him … no problem; Harry and I don't need him Next thing I knew … my heart is being ripped from my chest as I watched helplessly as a friend; (with limited emotional depth) … clinging to life by a thread. (The dolt got himself poisoned) – Although; as I sat by his bedside I did learn something that changed … things. .88**88 " He's just a friend ," Well, that lie (about Viktor) sort-of, came back and bit me on the behind. I'm still paying for the fact that_ 'he' _had to find-out about it (the library snogs and a-little groping) from his sister. 88**88 " He was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore … we wanted to tell him it's ready … the weapon ." I fed Umbridge this misinformation in an effort to draw her out, adding fake tears to compliment the lies. - - Odd thing is, I really enjoyed watching the centaurs carrying Umbridge into the woods, in the middle of their mating season. (ever wonder why you never see a female centaur; or where baby centaurs come from?) 88**88 " Yes, didn't you know … I like really good Quidditch players ?" Maybe my life wasn't in danger that time, but my heart certainly was. He's accomplished, he's worldly; it could be a wonderful experience , and he's only the second boy I ever dated . And then suddenly, I found myself with cold lips pressed against mine (under a mistletoe) as he publicly groped me … making me feel nothing but disgust and regret. Viktor and Cormac turned out to be a pair of losers and flirting with Harry for years, have been repeatedly rebuffed (sometime forcefully and in my face) what's wrong with me? - I know I lack social skills, but Harry keeps telling me, that I am not his type of bird. I keep wondering what kind of bloke would fancy someone like me … no wait – there is one that fancies me loads, I mean it's obvious, but I refuse to encourage this lazy country bumpkin … I'm sure I can do better. 88**88 " Your names are Wendell and Monica Wilkins and you have no children ." – The mountain of lies I tell, keeps growing …so easily accepted; is becoming disturbing. The Magical erasing; not only their minds but their hearts as well, came to me too easily. - I mind-wiped my own parents for Harry's sake – and because of it …his red headed, dimwitted friend thinks I fancy Harry… oh sweet Merlin - he can be so infuriating. Besides I hope that he's wrong, I hope that my parents will forgive me for what I did to them when I carefully explain the logic behind my actions. It was a purely tactical decision … nothing personal (and yet I cried) and strangely, it was him and not Harry that offered me comfort. (Why didn't I figure it out sooner?) 88**88 " What are you doing?" " What do you mean?" " Are you staying or what?" " I …" she looked anguished. "Yes-yes, I'm staying, Ron we said we'd go with Harry, we said we'd help …" " I get it. You choose him" Harry doesn't remember that last bit; all he remembers is that wearing the locket made Ron go mental. History will never record that stupid thing affected me just as negatively as it did Harry. Ron just had the worst of it. - Harry still does not acknowledge on any level; the affects of Ron's unrequited feelings for me, had on his departure. It wasn't a lie that I told, so maybe it shouldn't be on this list …but Ron's last words before leaving the tent, has haunted me ever since. – I handled it wrong, I knew how he felt … I'm just terrible about expressing romantic feelings … another wasted opportunity... I suppose. I only made matters between us worse when Ron returned 88**88 You …complete …arse …Ronald …Weasley. You crawl back here …and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say … sorry . One thing I would like to know, how did you find us tonight; that's important. Once we know, we'll be able to make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see. The lie here was the-bit about me not wanting him there. The truth was that we both were sort-of lost without Ron. The only positive thing I got out of his absence (I cried loads and couldn't sleep well without him there) was the realization of how important he was in my life. 88**88 " It isn't the real sword … it's a copy!" This time I tried telling the truth, but that bitch Lestrange didn't want to hear it, so I told her lies instead. The truth didn't really matter since she only wanted a confession that I wouldn't provide. Of course there are certain lies you tell yourself to survive. – These are substantially harder to swallow, than the ones you speak out loud. Let them all think I'm a know-it-all, I don't care; I don't need any friends . Ha, that's a laugh! – It hurt me more than I can possibly say … that I had no friends, in Muggle schools or magical … I always alienated my peers as soon as I opened my mouth … in short, I am not a people person. I've stepped on Harry's last nerve plenty of times too, and I'm equally sure that the only reason that Harry didn't tell me to_ ' sod-off ' _permanently (years ago), was Ron … truth was I needed him more than anyone in the entire world (although I'll never admit it). Ron was my constant: my rock, my source of comfort. I knew that he would never deliberately harm me. - He was my primary defender and when I asked Harry why he never came to my defense; his answered was always the same. - - "I don't fancy you (at all) and Ron does. I gave you no thought at Malfoy Manor, because I didn't need to … Ron was there and his first thought has always been of you." How do you reply to that? - Harry had made it plain (once again) that he didn't fancy me … that he was still in love with Ginny. I had wasted six plus years pursuing the chosen One and Harry had just shot me down … again. I knew of only one other boy that genuinely fancied me (just one) and if I gave into him there would be no regret, only passion. I knew that his lips would be warm; his caress addictive. He put great stock in loyalty and fidelity … so he wouldn't cheat on me. … He's totally supportive of me in anything I wanted to do, with a house-elf to keep his household in order (and a picture prefect nanny for nippers) and his own business that was ninety percent Mail-order based. He could easily be a stay at home parent that was usually kind-hearted; he was in fact the prefect mate for a career girl. So I was never 'just fine' without him at my elbow. 88**88 I was more than willing to die, just let the pain end . There's no more reason to fight . Okay, this one wasn't a complete lie. I would have done anything to make the pain stop, short of course … of giving Bella the lie she wanted. I was just about to give up … to die … when I heard his voice, felt his anguish. His passion, his love; reminded me that there was something to fight for, something to live for – him ." "Malfoy Manor was a turning point and at Shell Cottage I had my- gotcha -moment. At Shell Cottage all the pieces fell into place, I experienced a personal Epiphany. - I was literally mere inches from death and who was at my side, carried me across the sands … stayed with me, when I was unconscious … was right there when I opened my eyes… him. I've never before encountered that intensity of love … certainly not from my workaholic parents … and frankly Ron's overwhelming feelings scared me. To an average witch such strong love and commitment from a bloke …would be a dream come true, but I am not an average anything. I had long term plans – a career already picked out and a family to a feminist (like me) is a major distraction and children a career wrecker. - I then underwent a mental civil war of my own, pulled between love and family and a rapid climb in the ranks of the Ministry. Knowing me as well as he did; Harry correctly predicted my decision. To my never ending shame I kept the finest wizard I would ever know at arm's length, for almost two years. – We sort of dated but things never got serious. Not wanting to lose him, I went out with him enough times to keep him interested and when separated; I wrote him long letters every day. I spent the summer after the_ Riddle War _finding my parents and Ron proved right, they disowned me. How dare a girl of seventeen decide to send them out of the country with erased memories; without consulting first, her 40ish year-old parents? - Its going to take years to make amends with them. A redo of my seventh year at Hogwarts (alone) also took me away from my semi-official boyfriend for nine months (no visits I didn't want to be distracted). - It wasn't until after graduation, the third year after the Riddle war, that I reconnected with a still very single Ron the shopkeeper and I've promised
