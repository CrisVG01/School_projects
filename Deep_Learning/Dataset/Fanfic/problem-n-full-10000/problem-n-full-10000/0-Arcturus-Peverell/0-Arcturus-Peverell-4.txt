### I have been entertaining this idea in my mind since the last month but due to the lack of time, I couldn't put it down to words. I hope I will be able to create a Voldemort character whom people read and enjoy. As always, read, follow, favorite and review. Thank you all. ### Since the starting is canon, I preferred to use up whatever JKR had provided for the initial origin of T.M. Riddle. The story will be AU from the next chapter onwards. " The darkest souls are not those who choose to exist within the hell of the abyss, but those which choose to break free from the abyss and move silently among us." New Year's Eve, 1926. Lightning tore through the sky. The young woman was heavily pregnant and in labor if the pains were anything to go by. She moved along the empty street holding her hand to her stomach as she walked aimlessly. She barely noticed the pelting of the sleet and snow coming down on her. The wind forcing the cold through her meager jacket and the thin dress. The cold pelting into her skin like a knife of ice with each gust of wind, sapping what little warmth she had away from her. This ice storm was nothing new to her. She had endured several of these storms since losing her last apartment. Sometimes she could find another corner of the city to stay in, but not for long. The weather seemed especially brutal this evening. Even with the New Year approaching, there were very few people on the streets to celebrate in this cold wet storm. She looked up at the road in front of her. She found herself standing in front of a huge sprawling compound with a large sign that read, WOOL'S ORPHANAGE. She passed through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded by high railings. She mounted the few steps leading to the front door before the pain overwhelmed her. She closed her eyes and focused. A destination. A place for her child to be born. Just a few more blocks and she could rest. It was not much longer and she would be warm. She would make it there in just a few more minutes. With each step, she repeated the mantra as the sleet tried to slice the cold into her just a little more like he father's Crucio would slice into her nerves like a hot knife. He taught her how to endure. She was so cold as she rang the doorbell. Wool's Orphanage. The pains were worse, almost unbearable. Starting in her back but ending in her stomach with a resounding need to push. As she landed on her knees even as the Matron of the orphanage opened the door yelling about who dared come at this hour of night. The Matron, one Elizabeth Cole, yelled as she stood outside, but half of her words remained behind in her throat, as she stared at the body fallen in front of the door. "Oh, my Lord" the Matron exclaimed to the two others inside the building. "Hurry and help me get the poor thing inside. Quickly! She's about to give birth!" Two women helped the woman up off the front porch and into the warm building before another contraction could come. They led her to a small room off to the side and quickly got her into an office that had a small cot. "I am sorry for the small bed here, but all the beds are upstairs and I don't think we have…," Elizabeth started to say just as the young woman screamed out… Her skin was cold, clammy and was not warming fast enough. They were not a medical facility but had called a doctor from a hospital and hopefully, one would arrive soon. The contractions were coming fast and the baby was not going to wait. They had done this a few times before, so they were ready. "One last push, Miss. You are almost there!" The Matron encouraged the woman. She did not even get the woman's name yet, but that could come later. For now, they had to get the baby born. She had a small worn blanket ready to wrap him. With one last push, there the head was crowning and the baby was coming out. She gently held the head of the infant helped him out as the mother gave a final push. As the babe was released from her body, the Matron cleaned him up, wrapped him in the blanket, and turned her attention to the mother while her assistant gave the boy to his mother. "I hope he looks like his papa," the woman's lips twisted to form a soft smile, though it seemed that even the slightest muscle movement seemed to cause her unbearable pain. "Don't you have any-" Elizabeth paused, hesitating for a moment, "—any family? Your husband?" The woman's face seemed to sink into despair at the thought. "My husband-", she paused as she let out another shriek of pain, "he won't accept me, he won't-" her limbs began to convulse but she somehow controlled it, "- accept his son." Elizabeth had some choice words coming to her mouth about the man but she kept them to herself. "What will be his name?" "Name him—name him Tom- Tom Mar-" she convulsed in pain once again- "Tom Marvolo Riddle." She let out a shriek of pain as she continued, "Tom after his father, Marvolo was after his grandfather." Elizabeth wondered if the woman and her family came from a circus, what the weird names her family had. Marvolo? Really? What kind of name was that? "Are you sure that's the na-" Elizabeth began, but her words died in her throat. There in her arms, with her head cradled in Elizabeth's lap, the woman lay completely still. Lifeless. Dead. Eleven years later. The orphanage was always so noisy. Tom woke up from his little bed inside his room. It was not that great, but had the bare necessities- a rickety wooden chair, a makeshift table, an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead. Not something, one would regard as proper but well, that was all he had all his years at the orphanage. He had been there all his life, and Mrs. Cole—the matron had told him that his mother had named him. He stood up. Standing in front of the tiny mirror stuck to the wall, he observed himself. An unruly mass of hair on the head, raven-black in color, a pale face and jet-black eyes stared back at him. However, he had brief flashes of memories, perhaps something like a half-remembered dream, when his eyes had a reddish tinge in them instead of the usual jet-black. Sometimes, Tom felt that his life seemed to be missing something, perhaps it was the lack of interesting things in the orphanage. Perhaps it was his wish to get away from the bullies. Perhaps, it was the strange powers that he had, and controlled so well. Tom smiled. Time to get ready. Mrs. Cole will be rather- He stopped. Stood still, completely still. Then there was that feeling again. Something inexplicable, something that raised the hairs on his back. Something he had never experienced, he knew he hadn't, and yet... It all seemed like a half-remembered dream. He quickly slid the door open and stealthily crept out of his room. The sounds of the rusted iron gates meant just one thing—someone had arrived. Else, there was no way someone would open the gates this early in the morning. Mrs. Cole was rather intimidating and forceful; the woman did love her rules. He crept beside the tiny storage cupboard that overlooked the lawn outside, and had a tiny little square opening (Tom had made it, not that he would admit it), a perfect way to eavesdrop at the happenings outside without being spotted. There was an old man standing inside the gates, talking to Betty. Tom was sure that the man was drawing many curious glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing. "Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole, who, I believe, is the matron here?" the man said. He had a deep voice; the ones that made people listen in peace. It reeked of power. "Oh," said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore's eccentric appearance. "Um... just a mo'... MRS. COLE!" she bellowed over her shoulder. Tom heard a distant voice shouting something in response. The girl turned back to the old man. "Come in, she's on her way." The man followed her in, and Tom felt himself somehow drawn to the man for some inexplicable reason. He crept out of the cupboard and stealthily crept close to Mrs. Cole's room, hiding inside the rickety old shoe cupboard outside her room. It had cockroaches inside, but plainly, Tom's curiosity overwhelmed his dislike and irritation for them. He pressed his ear close to the door and tried to listen carefully. "-and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whaley's oozing all over his sheets — chicken pox on top of everything else," Mrs. Cole was talking to someone when she suddenly paused and then- "Good afternoon," It was the man's voice. "My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today." "Oh yes. Well — well then —you would better come into my room. Yes." Mrs. Cole replied feebly. It was most unlike her, Tom decided, knowing that the Matron was possibly one of the sternest people he had met. "I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future," said Tumble- Tumblemore? Tom could not remember the name exactly. "Are you family?" asked Mrs. Cole. Tom felt his throat constrict in surprise. The man had come for him? Was he family? Was that why he had had that feeling and- "No, I am a teacher," said Dumbledore. "I have come to offer Tom a place at my school." A school? This man is a teacher? "What school's this, then?" "It is called Hogwarts," said Dumbledore. "And how come you're interested in Tom?" "We believe he has qualities we are looking for." "You mean he's won a scholarship? How can he have done? He's never been entered for one." "Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —" "Who registered him? His parents?" Tom was pretty sure that Mrs. Cole seemed less and less agreeable to take the man's words at face value. "Here," the man said finally, "I think this will make everything clear." Pause. "That seems perfectly in order ," she replied placidly. Tom could not believe his ears. One moment, she was almost ready to throw the man out and the next- then a cold feeling shot down his spine. Was he one of those men- the ones who buy children and then sell their organs to make money? For a moment, Tom wished he had never eavesdropped into the conversation. For a second, he wondered if he should escape before the man came for him. Then again, he was underage. The police would perhaps get hold of him and throw him into another orphanage, and there would be a new set of bullies to tolerate. At least he knew people here. However, that was for later, and the man—Dumbledore was talking. "I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddle's history. I think he was born here in the orphanage?" "That's right," said Mrs. Cole. "I remember it clear as anything, because I'd just started here myself. New Year's Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night. And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the
