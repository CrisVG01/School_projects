Chapter 1: Introduction to a Broken Life "Masen. I was born a Masen and raised a Masen. It was my surname, my 'treasure' and duty as the only child, only male, to pass it on. And yet my name was a curse bestowed upon me from the one I hated most: my father." ~Edward Masen, Jr. When my mother died when I was eight, my father became a drunk. It was at this age that my life became a horrid, tangled mess of pain and emptiness. I could predict each day of my life: I would wake up, go to school, come home, get beaten, make dinner, get beaten, and go to bed. I would hear my father sneak out not long after I would go to bed and not return until the early hours of the morning. As soon as he arrived, I would cringe under my dirty, bloodied sheets and pray that I would, for once avoid the inevitable. It was a rare and joyous occasion when I would. My father would stomp up the steps and into my bedroom, ripping me from the warmth of my disgusting bed and take out his anger of life on me. Often times, while he was doing this, he'd curse me, telling me he hated me for killing my mother. Though my father hit me everywhere, he liked to target my face. He always said that I didn't deserve to look like her. He would mangle my face beyond recognition, beat me, hit me until I was black and blue, until I spit out blood, until I could no longer see due to the swelling of my cheeks. When he was finally satisfied, he collapsed in his bedroom, leaving me sobbing in a puddle of my own blood. For two years, I begged for forgiveness. Longed for the love he used to show me. I would plead; cry as he hit me, telling him I loved him, that I didn't mean to kill her, that I was sorry. These pathetic attempts at apologies only resulted in more brutal beatings. I wasn't worthy of forgiveness, love, or relief. I was only worthy of pain, hate, and hardships. It was when I was ten that I finally gave up, surrendering into the dark, painful recesses of my brain, the part that showed me endless memories of her , my mother. I honestly didn't mean to kill her. But, of course, her death was on my own hands. I begged her to take me to the park, forced her to drive the long way home in an attempt to scoundrel ice cream from her. I didn't call for help after she crashed into the tree. I lay in the backseat of the car, crumbled into a ball and splashed with both her blood and my own. I merely stared wide-eyed and frozen at my mother who screamed at me to get out of the car and run. After much yelling, I finally snapped out of my shock induced trance and obeyed my mother's orders. I ran, ran as fast as I could, until the black car and the smell of fire and smoke disappeared behind me. I ended up collapsing a few miles from the place of the accident. How I managed to make it so far, I'll never know, but I did. "Hey!" Someone shook me awake. I opened my eyes to meet those of a female stranger. "Are you okay, sweetie? What happened?" My forehead creased and something wet dripped down into my eyes. I wiped at it unthinkingly and was met with an unbearable pain. I began crying instantly; the pain, mixed with confusion and fear became too much for my eight year old mind. I broke down in front of that kind stranger, sobbing loudly, for I knew no better. "Hey, it's okay. Just…just tell me what happened," she pleaded, her eyes alert with worry. The poor girl couldn't have been older than 20. "Momma!" I sobbed over and over, my frantic eyes searching the area for her, but coming up short. "Where is she?" The woman beseeched me now, but I was too young to comprehend what was going on. "I want my mommy!" I was begging, pleading with the woman. She sighed, "I don't know where she is, honey." This only made me cry harder. The woman called the police, and apparently, they had already found my mother, dead and charred on the side of a random road. Of course, I didn't find this out until much later. My father was the one to tell me. Naturally, I didn't quite understand. I knew she was gone, and this made me heartbroken. But, what was death? And…why couldn't she come back? Didn't she love us anymore? 3rd grade started up. By now my father had already become fully dependent on alcohol. And, therefore was beating me regularly. "Put these on! Now!" My father shoved me a baseball hat and some sunglasses. He said I was ugly and needed to hide my face. I believed him, of course. I put the items on quickly and turned to him for a question. "Where do I go?" I spoke quietly, knowing speaking too loudly would result in pain. "Are you stupid!? You go in the classroom!" "But…" My eyes filled with tears. Fear. Confusion. Fear. Relief when he didn't hit me immediately, "Which one?" "How the hell am I supposed to know!? Now get your ass in there before I smack you!" I heeded his warning. The hat was too large for me and it slipped down in front of my eyes. That coupled with my sunglasses that were entirely too big for my face made seeing virtually impossible. Eventually, I did find the correct classroom; though I was late. I limped into the classroom, trying to avoid putting any pressure on my left leg. There, I was met with an agitated sigh and a few quite whispers. Even though I could make out none of them, I knew they were about me. "What's your name?" I looked up and met the cold, hard eyes of my new teacher. She was elderly looking, with thick eye glasses and a puff of awful gray hair that was tied back into a frizzy bun. I swallowed loudly. My mouth had gone dry. Ever since my dad started hitting me, grown-ups just didn't feel safe anymore. "Edward Masen." I choked out. She scribbled something on a notebook before turning back to me. " You are late. When you're late you need a tardy pass. Don't you ever come in late without a tardy pass again. Understood?" I nodded vigorously. " And ," Her eyes flashed, "Don't ever, ever wear sunglasses and a hat to my classroom again. Am I clear?" I nodded again. "I asked you a question and therefore I want an answer." "Yes ma'am." I whispered. Snickers came from my left and my face turned pink under the black and blue discoloration. "Remove them at once." She pointed at my face. After a split second of hesitation, I pulled both the glasses and cap away from my face and placed them into her waiting hands, ashamed. "Goodness, gracious, boy! What on earth happened to your face? Were you out fighting?" My mom told me it was bad to lie, but my dad said I couldn't tell anyone what happened. Ever. Because I couldn't stand the idea of facing my father's wrath and consequently pain, I nodded once again. "There shall be none of that in my classroom, either. Sit." I followed her finger to a seat in the very back, nestled in between two walls. Placing my bottom on the seat carefully, I winced as I swung my legs around. The seat pressed on my bruises. Mrs. McKay, I learned her name was, then started the class. Unfortunately, I knew everything she was teaching and now had nothing to distract myself with. At the end of the day, she gave us something called homework for the first time ever. Mrs. McKay so eloquently worded the definition as " work that you take home ." All the other children's parents were waiting for them when school dismissed at three o'clock. Not my father. The busses didn't run to my house because I lived outside of town and too far away, and the teacher said I was too young to walk. I had to wait. At five in the evening my father still hadn't shown up and I began to worry, as did the poor teacher waiting with me. "Mr. Masen, sir, Edward is still at school." I looked up at the teacher through the sunglasses Mrs. MacKay so kindly gave back to me. "Well, sir he can't just stay here all night….Sir, I'm sorry, but he is much too young to be walking home. Yes, I realize that, but - hello? Sir? Mr. Masen! Hello!?" She sighed clicking her cell phone off. Ten minutes later my father's car pulled into the parking lot. A large wave of relief spread through me at the sight of it, but it faded very quickly, turning into a drowning fear. He stormed over to where the blonde teacher and I were standing. Grabbing and yanking my wrist firmly, he turned to her in a rage. "Don't you dare tell me how to raise my son!" "Sir, I wasn't trying -" Her eyes were wide. Dad cut her off. "I know what you were trying to do! Come on, Edward." He snarled dragging me and my throbbing ankle to his car. Once we were in, my father revved the engine and peeled out of the parking lot abruptly making the tires squeals. I wanted to scream right along with them…. He turned to me once we were speeding away. "Don't ever make me look like a fool ever again!" I nodded hysterically, tears welling up in my eyes. We were home shortly and his fist connected with my face as soon as we were safely inside. Over and over he pummeled me on the kitchen floor. I couldn't move when he was finished. My body felt like a 300 ton weight had been dropped on it. "Get up." He commanded. I tried but all I accomplished was arching my back, twitching my fingers and toes, and whimpering. My eyes were hooded in exhaustion as tears ran from them soundlessly. I breathed through my parted and bloody lips. And I was bloody. Very much so. It seemed like my very soul was bleeding out on the kitchen floor, killing me internally, if not physically…. When I was ten, my father began whipping me with a belt. When I was eleven, my father hit me in the face with a metal baseball bat. It split my lip open and I had seven stitches along my bottom lip. No one asked me what happened…no one cared. At 12, my hair was almost touching my top lip. I let it hang in my hang face. The strands provided welcomed coverage, but it was too long, and my father started calling me a girl. Before this age, he had cut it with scissors - never higher than my cheekbones but this year, my father declared that he was sick of always having to take care of me of me. If I want it cut, I had to do it myself. And I did. In September of my fourteenth year, I met Jasper. He and his sister had just moved here from Texas. They were twins, he and Rosalie. The girl hated me like everyone else on this God-forsaken planet. But Jasper…he actually became my first and only friend. However, Jasper was a bit of a punk, so to speak, and a large influence on me. He and I became fast friends, and eventually, I began to trust him…. "Edward!" Jasper ran up to me, smiling widely. I glanced up at him from the book
