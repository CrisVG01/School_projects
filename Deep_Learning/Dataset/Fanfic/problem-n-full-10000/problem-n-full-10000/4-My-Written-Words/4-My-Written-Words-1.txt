Author's Note: This is a story I've had in my head for a very long time. This isn't the first time I've attempted to write this, but it is the first time I've posted it. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I've enjoyed writing this. I have just a few warnings before we begin. First off, these vampires are mine, and not the ones you're all probably used to. Second, this story isn't a gentle walk in the park. It gets pretty fucking angsty, don't be fooled by the slightly cheery first chapter. [ Edit: The first chapter was over 8,000 words, so I split in half.] Chapter Song: Everyday is Exactly the Same by Nine Inch Nails Chapter 1: In Medias Res I saw the world before me appear from behind tired eyelids. Taking a quick glance at my alarm clock alerted me that I had had another four hours night sleep. Being only five in the morning, I was utterly aware of the fact that I had two hours to get ready for school. Heaving a sigh, I removed myself from the mess of the covers tangled around me. I dragged my feet to the bathroom, feeling every bone in my body. With a drawn out yawn, my arms moved to strip myself as if on impulse. My mind seemed to be turning into an undefined mush. My hands were quick to turn on the faucet, but my body lingered outside of the shower stall, staring at my oversized bathroom with glassy eyes. I supposed some people would consider me lucky. I was, like my other two siblings, adopted by two very great people, people who were my late parents' oldest friends. But all of this, the glass, walk-in shower, the expensive black marble floor, the light teal walls, and the oversized counter with the squared off sink, was just excess. I didn't feel lucky, I didn't feel blessed, I felt…uneasy. As if this fortune was merely an apology for the shitty childhood I had endured. My feet kicked aside my discarded clothes lying in a clump on the floor and stepped into the wall of steam. Hot showers were one of the things I lived for. I went through the motions of cleaning myself with care, purposely wasting time. I hated waiting. Being as impatient as I am, extra time was a serious aggravation. And so, with this thought lingering in my head, I grabbed my straightedge and shaving cream, smearing it across my face. I looked into the foggy mirror, quickly whipping the hand that wasn't covered in shaving cream across it to defog the glass. Line after line I swept the razor over my skin. I had requested of Esme to put this mirror in the shower for me. I loathed sink shaving. It left a mess I wasn't always so willing to clean, especially with a straightedge razor. I cleaned my face off once I was finished, smiling slightly at the much younger face looking back at me. Bella would be pleased. She had been begging me to get rid of my stubble for the last week. I quickly finished in the shower, taking extra time to rinse everything off. I grabbed the deep blue towel off its wrack and wrapped it tightly around my hips, letting the left over water on my body slide into the soft cloth. Padding my way out of the bathroom and to my closet, I let my mind wander again. My social studies, advanced calculus, and my American Literature tests were all today, explaining my late nights. A sigh slipped through my tense mouth. I understood the purpose of good grades, of course, but I hated not having any time to myself, or to my girlfriend of two years. I felt bad about that. I had to make it up to her somehow, and with a terrifying lurch of my body, I realized it was her birthday. She was 17 today and I hadn't bought her a thing. My heart started to thump loudly in my chest. Irrationally, I wondered if I would have enough time to go out and buy her something before school started. I found myself rushing to pull on a pair of jeans and white tee before my sleep deprived mind finally clicked into gear. Newman's flower shop was open at 6 and Alice…yes, this was all coming together quite nicely. I threw on a black button down shirt, pulled on an old pair of black high-top Chucks, and spent a good fifteen minutes trying to find my Carhartt, before realizing I had hung it up downstairs. Grabbing my cell phone, I checked the time. It was only 5:45, leaving me with plenty of time to work my plan out. My legs pulled me agilely down the two sets of stairs and into the front hall of my adoptive parents' mansion. I grabbed my coat and the keys to my Volvo and hurried into the cavernous garage. It only took me ten minutes to get to Newman's and I even had to wait outside until the tired looking woman pulled up in her old champagne colored Camry. She was old, white haired, and wore a long floral dress that covered up an aging body. Not wanting to startle the poor woman, I waited outside for a few moments to let her get situated. I took my time in the store, trying to find a bouquet that I thought Bella would like. I knew she like daisies. She spent a lot of her time when we were children picking them. I remembered her fondly, putting them into her long brown hair and commanding me to call her a princess. With a smile, I grabbed the biggest one they had. It was a variation of stained daisies with every color of the rainbow. I was nervous after I paid that she wouldn't like them. Bella wasn't always the easiest to buy presents for. I sighed, resigned to whatever fate these flowers would give me and set them delicately into the front seat of my car. I pulled my car into the garage, right next to my father's black Mercedes. I was hoping that Alice would be awake. I was answered quickly when I opened the door that led to the huge, shiny kitchen. There, crowded around the island bar, was my entire family. Alice and Emmett were arguing about something and Esme was handing them their breakfast with disapproving eyes. My father was seated at the end closest to me, drinking a cup of coffee out of a mug with a family portrait of us stamped on it like a blurry porcelain photo, and was reading over some patient's file with a creased forehead. At my entrance, they all turned to look at me. Alice rolled her eyes and Emmett gave me a fleeting smile. Carlisle, after noticing it was his son and not an intruder, turned his face back to his work. Esme, on the other hand, turned her disapproving glare from her two other children onto me. "So nice of you to join us," she said. Her eyes were tight and her mouth was set into a worried little frown. "Where have you been?" "Newman's." I said this at the time Alice muttered, "He forgot Bella's birthday." My throat felt a little dry at her comment, but I always knew to count on Alice knowing things she shouldn't. "Oh, Edward," Esme said, "Well, at least you got her something. Here, eat some breakfast. You look hungry…and tired." Her gentle hands were holding my face as I sat down at the island. I shrugged out of her hands as politely as I could. I didn't enjoy making her worry. "I'm fine, Esme." I dug into my plate of eggs and bacon, and looked over at my sister who was eating Lucky Charms. I would never understand how she could give up bacon just to save a few helpless animals. "Hey, Alice," I started, purposely taking a large bite of my protein filled breakfast as soon as she looked at me. Her expression soured right away. "I was wondering if you could distract Bella this afternoon so I could go to Port Angeles and grab her something." She looked at the ceiling with obvious irritation. "Lucky for you, Edward , I was planning on going to her house after school to help her pick out her outfit for the party tonight. But believe me; it's not for your benefit." "Perfect. Don't say anything to her or I'll skin you alive." I knew better than to ask about the party in front of our unsuspecting parents. Carlisle came alive then; the only word he seemed to hear was party. "What party?" I was careful to keep my eyes on the food I was eating, letting Alice answer. "Oh, it's nothing, Carlisle. We're just going out to Port Angeles with a couple of our friends to see a movie and then go have dinner afterwards." Alice flashed him a smile. She was a tiny 4 feet and 10 inches and looked like a little pixy with her short black hair, spiked in organized disarray. Usually, Carlisle was putty in her tiny hands, but not today, apparently. "You think I'm falling for that?" He asked, offended. I knew what the problem was. Alice was like a happy little Christmas elf. She was trusting and delicate and only 17. So, when she started to see the 21 year old James, everyone in this family was on edge, even happy-go-lucky Emmett. All of our minds seemed to be in the same place. Alice was instantly on edge, realizing what this was really about. Carlisle wasted no time in getting to the point, "Is James going to this party ?" "Carlisle, I'm almost an adult. You can't force me to not see him. I love him!" My sister never looked or sounded more like a child. "Exactly! You are almost an adult, Alice. But, never once have I told you who you can and cannot be involved with. I'm allowed to worry about you, aren't I?" Carlisle's face softened, and he became unusually emotional, "I know I'm not your real father. I will never pretend to be, but I love you like you're my own. I just want the best for you and for all my children." I saw Esme out of the corner of my eye hiding a tearful smile behind a dish that needed washing. I looked at Carlisle quickly, not wanting him to see how much his words had touched me. Alice seemed to be doing the same thing. Her eyes dropped and she went back to eating her cereal in silence. Eventually, she managed to collect herself, her eyes returning to the man who raised her since she was four. "I love you, too, you know. We'll be careful, tonight. I promise." That was the end of the conversation, and I noticed that Emmett had been quite the entire time. This was quite out of character for my brother. I had almost forgotten he was here. I glanced up at him and saw that he was pushing his food around his plate, not really eating. I was confused again; he was being really strange today. The three of us headed to my Volvo in silence. It wasn't until we were speeding down the road that I finally turned to my brother sitting in the passenger's seat next to me. "Hey, uh, Em? Are you okay today?" He pursed his lips, seemingly debating on whether to answer or not. Eventually, he muttered, "I just got a bad feeling. About tonight, I mean. You ever get one of those?" Alice answered for me. " Yes . Don't worry though it's probably nothing." He smiled
