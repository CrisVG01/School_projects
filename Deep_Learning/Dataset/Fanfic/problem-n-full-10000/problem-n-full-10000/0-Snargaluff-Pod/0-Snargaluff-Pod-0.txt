I was bitten by a plot bunny. Here's the result. I hope you enjoy. :3 ################################# Disclaimer: I DO NOT OWN HARRY POTTER. ################################# She couldn't believe it. He was gone; both of them were gone. Tears blurred her vision as she ran for her life. She had always thought that they would come out on top, that the light would win, but that conclusion was folly. They had failed to destroy the last horcrux. They had lost and her boys were dead. She ran, not paying attention to where she was headed, knowing that she needed to get out of there before she was killed too. But what was the point? Life was nothing without her friends with her. She had lost so much, so many people were dead. She would use the time turner round her neck to change everything, but they only went back 24 hours at the most and she had no clue how she would be able to change the outcome so that the light would win. They were far too outnumbered for any sort of a plan to work. It had been a slaughter. She tripped on something, falling face first into the blood soaked ground. Something smashed. Hermione turned around to see a red spell coming towards her, burning pain lighting her nerve endings up like a muggle Christmas tree. Her vision blurred and as she blacked out she could have sworn that she had seen a golden glow encompass her. /\\/\\/\\/\\ Give Your Heart a Break /\\/\\/\\/\\ It was breakfast time in the great hall. James and Sirius had stuck their heads together. One would usually think that this would be metaphorically. But someone had thought it would be funny to use a sticking charm to actually stick their heads together and this was now what they were trying to puzzle out. When they had first realised what had happened the two pranksters pranced around the great hall like a pair of lunatics. The headmaster chuckled lightly at the duo who seemed to, despite being pure-blooded and in a magical school, have forgotten that they could use magic. Dumbledore waved his wand, ending the charm, but Professor McGonagall was not very impressed. She glared at the boys who then sat down at the Gryffindor table. "Moony mate-" Sirius started, "-I can't believe-" James continued, "-that you got us again!" they both finished in unison. "It wasn't me." Remus shrugged. "Then who was it?" Until that moment none of them had noticed the grinning first year sitting not very far down the table. "No!" Sirius cried, putting the pieces together first, "We were pranked by a first year!" He continued noisily in his lamenting, now dying dramatically on the top of the table. "Well done." the other Marauders said in unison to the tiny first year who was almost bouncing in excitement at the fact that he had actually managed to successfully prank them, "But you should know that this means that we have to get you back!" The smile of the first year immediately vanished as the blood left his face. A promise to be pranked by the Marauders was certain humiliation. Seeing his scared look Remus reassured the young boy, "Don't worry Daniel, I'll try to reign them in a bit." Most people had come to ignore Sirius by this point, however their attention was redirected to him as a golden glow appeared in the air above him. Sirius soon followed the eyes of the people around him and leapt off the table, his joking forgotten. Eyes turned to Dumbledore who was just as confused and concerned as his students. A scream, quiet at first, grew in volume, silencing the whispers in the Great Hall, all turned towards the source. Bang! The light disappeared and a girl that was covered in blood took its place; bushy brown hair flying wild. Gravity caught hold of her and she plummeted to the table, smashing her head on a large jug and started to bleed profusely. The professors leapt into action and the girl was rushed away quickly out of the Great Hall before you could even say Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. The moment the doors swung shut the whispers started. Who was she? What was that light? Was she working for You-Know Who? Why had there been screaming? The rumour mill was set into motion, each speculation wilder than the next. However these questions were soon placed aside by the student body as conversations slipped onto, through lack of information, more comfortable subjects. However Sirius and James, due to their naturally inquisitive nature, wanted to know more. They were all set to go bounding to the hospital wing, demanding to be answered. Luckily Remus managed to dissuade them from this plan, causing Sirius to switch all his energy into plotting revenge on Daniel. Something that was paused for the duration of Charms, as Professor Flitwick was not impressed by Sirius' constant babbling. "We should-" Sirius started excitedly, almost bouncing as he walked along with his friends on their way to DADA after Charms had finished. "-Go easy on him." Remus finished for him, glaring at his friend. "Awww. But Moon-" "Padfoot, I've told you time and time again that the puppy-dog look doesn't, and will never work on me!" "Please Moony! Please, please, please!" Sirius begged walking backwards in front of his friends. "He managed to prank us! Us! The marauders!" "Well then you now know that-" Remus's sentence was cut short as Sirius tripped and started to disappear over the handrail. "Padfoot!" James cried, and rushed to grasp Sirius's foot. But it was too late. The three marauders looked on helplessly as their friend fell. Remus and James had their wands out to try and slow Sirius's fall, but the stairs decided to change, cutting Sirius's decent short and any time they had to try and help him. The sound of Sirius's bones breaking as he hit the staircase two floors below was audible. "Someone go get Madam Pomfrey!" Remus yelled as he ran down the stairs, using a secret passageway behind a tapestry of a snidget at the base of the staircase to get to Sirius as quickly as possible. Remus was the first person on the scene, immediately casting diagnostic charms to find out the level of damage. Apart from being unconscious due to head trauma, Sirius had broken both arms; three ribs; and had dislocated his left shoulder. Nothing particularly life threatening. At least, nothing that Madam Pomfrey was unable to fix within the next 24 hours. Remus conjured a stretcher and levitated Sirius onto it. James and Peter arrived, panting from having ran the whole way down. Remus forgot sometimes how much faster than them he was as a result of his lycanthropy. "How is he?" Peter asked. "Unconscious, but nothing too life threatening." Remus replied, "But I still need to get him to the Hospital Wing as quickly as possible." Peter and James nodded in understanding. The three of them started to leave when they were stopped by the arrival of Professor McGonagall. The woman gave the stretcher one glance and asked what had happened. Remus hesitated, Sirius really needed to be seen to as soon as possible. James nodded to Remus, and so Remus left James and Peter to explain. /\\/\\/\\/\\ Give Your Heart a Break /\\/\\/\\/\\ Hermione's eyes snapped open. It was quiet; too quiet. It was also rather dark. Cautiously she sat up, reaching for the wand that she hoped was in its holster. Hermione quickly realised that she was in the Hogwarts Hospital wing. But that was impossible, that area had been blown up just an hour ago. Hermione didn't understand. If there was one thing that Hermione hated, it would be not understanding something. There was a reason that she had spent countless hours in the library over the years. Looking around the hospital wing, Hermione saw that she was mostly alone. Why were there not a plethora of other injured people? Heck, how on earth had she escaped the Death Eaters? Hermione swung her legs off of the bed and stood up, determined to find out what was going on. Her vison blurred as she swayed on her feet. Hermione, even in her dizzy state recognised the symptoms of blood loss. Evidently she had lost a significant amount of blood for her to still be dizzy from it after a trip to the hospital wing. The world started to tilt and Hermione mentally braced herself for the hard reunion she was about to have with the floor. Suddenly there were arms around her. Someone had caught her. She cringed away from the physical contact. Hermione felt herself be lowered to the ground slowly and could feel that she was lent up against someone. Hermione started to panic. What if it was a death eater? But why would there be a death eater in the hospital wing? Why would a death eater have caught her? The logical side of Hermione's mind won out and her panic abated. As Hermione's vison cleared she realised that the person holding her upright was most definitely not female. "You can let go now." She said, speaking for the first time since she had woken. She was not enjoying being touched now that she was properly aware that it was happening. The arms around her retreated and Hermione went to try and stand up again, not expecting to be picked up from behind. Hermione flinched, her eyes automatically shutting and she waited for the pain to start. When none came Hermione opened her eyes to see the face of the person who was holding her. She immediately regretted it. She must be dead. There was no other plausible explanation for why she had been looking up at a young Sirius Black. Sirius was dead; dead as a doornail. Not an animate object that was transfigured into a doornail that could be returned to living status with a Finite Incantum; a safe, normal, muggle doornail. Hermione opened her eyes again to the same view as before. However, now the young Black had an expression of concern on his face, pity and empathy evident in his eyes. Hermione looked down at her hands. She was shaking. That would probably be why Sirius looked so concerned. "Are you okay?" he asked, his voice a whisper. Hermione looked up at him and raised an eyebrow. Sirius looked back at her sheepishly, obviously realising what a stupid question he had just asked. He swallowed nervously. "Could-" Hermione started to say, but then had to swallow, "Could you possibly put me down?" His eyes widened and Sirius immediately turned around towards the hospital bed that Hermione had been on previously and gently lowered her onto it. Hermione's back felt like it was on fire and a whimper of pain escaped her lips. She could feel the blood soaking through the hospital gown she was wearing. "I'll go get Madame Pomfrey." Hermione heard Sirius say, although her attention was on the pain rather than the marauder. It seemed like an eternity before Madam Pomfrey arrived and shoved what seemed to be a whole cauldron of potions down Hermione's throat. The last thing Hermione heard before she lost consciousness was Sirius asking if she was going to be okay. She didn't hear the answer Madame Pomfrey gave him. /\\/\\/\\/\\ Give Your Heart a Break /\\/\\/\\/\\ The next time Hermione opened her eyes she found herself surrounded by people, but nobody was paying her any attention as they were all arguing amongst themselves. Hermione was very confused by the group of people surrounding her. Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Harry, wait Harry? How was Harry alive? She had seen him die. Hermione had watched as the life faded from the green orbs as Voldemort took his final step towards victory. So much pain in those eyes as they apologised for what was to come, despite none of
