Disclaimer: I own nothing. So sad. :( What I wouldn't give to own Elrond at the least , lol. Title: The King's Tribute Rating: M Summary: While visiting Mirkwood on a diplomatic trip, Glorfindel has a bit too much wine and has a passionate affair with Thranduil's elk. The king is not happy and demands "tribute" from Lord Elrond in payment for Glorfindel's idiotic actions. Slash, humor. Pairing: Elrond/Thranduil. Warnings: Slash, male on male. (well, duh) - don't like hot elf mansex - don't read. Will be a little OOC, dunno, it has been a long time since I actually read Tolkien's work. But I just wanted to write something funny for a change. Not really AU, but does contain elements from both movie and bookverse. Notes: I've been out of the fanfiction scene for years and figured I'd crawl back into it. Meaning I am a shitty half-dyslexic typist and by the Valar I need a beta reader. Anyone up to the task? It'll mostly just be oneshots, I doubt if I have the dedication to go for a chapter fic just yet. Also the elk. IDK if it has a name, I couldn't find one. Nor do I remember it being in the book. So I went with Arsul, meaning 'royal wind' in Sindarin. The King's Tribute (Alternatively known as the tale of one stellar reason not to get drunk in the Mirkwood. Or perhaps why one SHOULD get drunk in the Mirkwood.) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Lord Elrond Peredhel, It is my regret to inform you that I am very dissatisfied with the behavior of your seneschal. He may have slain a balrog and been reborn a hero, but he is still an elfling at heart. Not that I do not appreciate a good drunken party - but Lord Glorfindel has gone too far. He deigned it fit to make passionate love to my dearly beloved Arsul while intoxicated. I expect you personally to appear here before me on the day of midyear to pay kindly in tribute. What do I ask in tribute? We shall see, Mellonen (my friend). We shall see... Also, only after satisfactory tribute is given shall I even see fit to read this letter from you. With sincerest annoyance, Thranduil PS: Tell Glorfindel my hair is prettier. I do not care if his lovely golden mane IS insured for all the gold in Erebor. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Elrond stared at the parchment in his hand with a mixture of disgust and disbelief. What in the name of the Valar could Thranduil possibly want from him in tribute? And was this a joke? If it was, he failed to see the humor. "Glorfindel." Elrond said somewhat sternly to the blonde elf sitting in the chair opposite his desk. "Explain. Now." "My Lord Elrond, it was a misunderstanding. The wine -" Glorfindel began sheepishly, casting his eyes downward rather than making eye contact with the infuriated lord of Imladris. "A simple task. That was all I asked of you. All you had to do was deliver a letter to King Thranduil. But instead you saw fit to enjoy a bit more wine than necessary and it led to this - this absolute travesty! You should know better." Elrond chastised him, crumpling Thranduil's letter in his hand as he fought to hold back his anger. Though, Elrond had to admit, he really hadn't been this angry in some time. "Who is Arsul?" He asked suddenly and stood so as to look down at Glorfindel like a misbehaved Elfling. "More of a what , really." Glorfindel replied, obviously cowed by Elrond's barely suppressed rage. "A... What?" The half-elf lord said, raising his eyebrows and shooting his seneschal a glare that could have killed him were it only that he were a mortal. "The elk. Arsul is the elk. You know that ponce doesn't ride a horse, he - "Glorfindel made a desperate attempt to explain and shrank further into the chair. He half wished he could just die rather than endure the scathing, venomous stare Elrond had transfixed him with. "Nan Belain! (By the Valar) Are you out of your mind?! I agree Thranduil IS a royal ponce, but this is... You are..." Elrond faltered and ran his fingers through his hair in distress. "I do not want to deal with this stupidity right now. Out. Out, NOW!" Glorfindel did not need telling twice and made a rather undignified retreat from Elrond's office in which he literally bolted as soon as he was outside. The thought crossed his mortified mind that maybe if he was quick enough he could get passage on the next ship to Valinor. Surely the gray havens would be preferable to Elrond's rage... Even though Elrond would eventually sail himself and would be very unlikely to let Glorfindel forget this situation anytime in the next five ages. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Elrond paced the office, his hands folded behind his back. This was ridiculous. This could NOT be happening. Thranduil and Glorfindel had to be playing at some foolish prank. The lord of Imladris did NOT have time for this idiocy! Really? The elk? Eventually Elrond left the study, dressed in his armor and packed a few necessities for the trip. He would go alone, not willing to suffer the shame of revealing the reason for calling upon the king of Mirkwood personally. Of course, his sons would likely find out and the hidden valley would be abuzz with scandalous rumors. 'When this is over, I am going to tie him to a chair in the study basement and beat the fool senseless. Then I'll leave him there for a week. With my luck, he'll probably enjoy it, though.' Elrond thought to himself as mounted his horse and began his solitary ride to Mirkwood. He intended to get a head-start. Elrond would not give Thranduil the satisfaction of seeing him arrive late. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The sun was high in the sky over the woodland realm at noontide on the day of midyear. Thranduil sat alone, not to mention impatiently, in his throne room. Absently, he drummed his fingers on the arm of his ornate chair. Perhaps he should have given Elrond more time to show up. It was a long ride to Imladris and the preparations for the midyear festival had already begun when he'd sent Glorfindel packing. Thranduil was looking forward to this. He couldn't wait to see the look on the proud herald of Gil-Galad's face when he explained what he desired in tribute. Thranduil licked his lips predatorily and twirled a lock of his silver-blonde hair around his index finger in anticipation. Best not to get his hopes up, though. It was unlikely for Elrond to be physically able to get there within the week â€“ especially when knowing the lord of Imladris, he would likely have an entourage slowing him down. Thranduil was proven wrong, however (much to his astonishment), when one of his attendants entered the hall. "My Lord, Lord Elrond Peredhel of Imladris has arrived and seeks your council as per a pre-arranged appointment. I do not remember seeing this appointment on the schedule, but -" The attendant, a rather scrawny (in Thranduil's opinion) elven woman began explaining. "He does indeed have an appointment. Send him in to me." Thranduil replied. "Alone." He added with a smirk. "Lord Elrond rode alone, sir. He has no entourage as he informed me it is apparently a matter of utmost importance that he not be late for this appointment." The attendant answered with a slight bow. Thranduil thought he might die from the laughter he was holding in. So he had come alone, this was priceless. "Shall I have sleeping arrangement made for our guest, my Lord?" "No need. I have plans for our half-elven friend." Thranduil said in clear dismissal. A few moments later Elrond entered the hall. He was still clad in his armor which was a bit dusty from the ride. Thranduil suppressed the urge to smile lecherously. That armor suited him well. Long had he harbored a secret attraction to the peredhel, but that armor made him look positively delicious. The deep burgundy color suited his dark hair and complexion well. "Ah, Lord Elrond. I am honored you did not keep me waiting, mellonen (my friend)." Thranduil said warmly and stood with flawless grace befitting of an elven king. He strode over to where Elrond stood and patted his armor clad shoulder lightly in greeting. He hoped Elrond had not detected the lust burning in his eyes - that would ruin the fun. "I trust you had a safe journey?" "Aye, I ran into no trouble. There were a few orcs on the road but they presented no threat to me. Besides, I ride faster without an entourage." Elrond replied in a respectful tone and rested his hand on the hilt of Hadhafang, as if to say without words the fate that had befallen the unfortunate orcs that he had encountered. Thranduil, however, knew Elrond well enough to know he was actually just avoiding offending him and his pride wouldn't allow him to have arrived one second late for the date he'd ordered. "Good, I would hate to think the trip had troubled you. Now, then, to business. We have some... tender matters to discuss concerning the actions of you seneschal." Thranduil told Elrond, getting to the point. He wasn't in the mood for courtly niceties, and was gratified to see the slight twinge of irritation pass over Elrond's carefully expressionless face. He knew Elrond found him a bit annoying, even if there was no real animosity. Sort of like an older brother, really. They get on your nerves, but you still care for them. "I sincerely apologize for this idiocy. I was so furious when I read your correspondence my seneschal is lucky to have escaped my study without having to make the journey to the hall of mandos for a second time. Surely, considering my anger at this whole situation, I would have been likely to have had less mercy than the balrog had Glorfindel not had the sense to get out of my sight." Elrond told the elven king. "Tell me what you demand in tribute and I will see it paid in haste." Thranduil smiled, the heated anger that momentarily flashed in the lord of Imladris' eyes enticed him greatly. "Very well. I accept your apology. I also trust you will see to it that Glorfindel is punished for his... moment of intoxicated passion." Thranduil said, struggling inwardly to keep the amusement out of his voice. It had actually happened of course - the affair with the elk, but somehow Thranduil saw it as a means to an end. Thranduil had Elrond not only exactly where he wanted him, but also alone. Oh Valar how long he waited for this day. Good things, it seemed, did come to those who waited patiently. "At any rate - the terms of my tribute: I feel a great wound to my pride has been struck now that my noble steed has become a local laughingstock. It is better for you to have come alone, Lord Elrond, for I feel the only acceptable tribute for this is a wound to your pride. As any good leader knows he must take responsibility for the actions of those below him." Elrond raised his eyebrows, but kept his expression neutral much to Thranduil's annoyance and growing tension. Much more of this and his elfhood would be standing at attention! That peredhel... Kind and selfless to a fault, but so self-assured and proud. "What exactly do you propose?" Elrond inquired, meeting Thranduil's eyes with a questioning glance. "My pride was wounded, so I intend to wound yours. Personally." Thranduil answered, stepping a bit closer so that the two elven lords were nearly touching. He kept his eyes Locked to Elrond's. He didn't want to miss the magical moment when comprehension dawned in those gorgeous cobalt orbs. And good
