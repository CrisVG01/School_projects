Disclaimer: I do not own any of these characters and I solemnly swear I make no money from this fic. A/N- I don't think I'll be going further back than this point. The 'Choices' universe, as I'm calling it, basically begins for my purposes at this point. For the record, you CAN read this without reading Choices. I intend for all of these to be standalone oneshots that don't require the others BUT reading all of them should give you a fuller picture. Also, rating is M because of language and a few slightly suggestive sexual situations. And some moans. But mostly cursing. They had done it. The war was over. Hermione Granger slumped against a house table. The Weasley twins sat on either side of her, "Your boyfriend saved Fred's life," George said. Hermione looked at him alarmed, "Excuse me?" "No need to hide it," Fred said. "We saw the way he was watching after you. Plus, he saved Tonks and Lupin too. Teddy's still got his parents." Hermione smiled, "I'm glad." "We just wanted you to know, we're cool with Malfoy. He did good today and given how he looked at you I doubt that's the first time he's done good," George said. "You should go to him." "What about Harry and Ron?" Hermione asked. "Just go Hermione. We'll make excuses if anyone asks," Fred said. "I'm assuming you kept it quiet for more than the war?" "His parents," Hermione admitted, "and Harry and Ron." "He just entered the Hall," George observed. "Go on then. Go enjoy what you fought for." "Thanks," she said, hugging both twins before walking down toward the entrance to the Great Hall where Draco stood awkwardly. "My parents are with Snape," he said when she approached. "He's being rushed to St. Mungo's for treatment for the damn snake's bite." Hermione smiled, relieved the potions master was alive. She knew how important he was to Draco. She led him out of the Great Hall and they moved toward the dungeons. With the Slytherins gone, no one would be in the Slytherin dorm. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Once they were in his dorm he hugged her and she returned it, pressing her body against his and closing her eyes to inhale the familiar scent that was Draco. "I love you," he whispered. Hermione kissed the side of his neck, "I love you too," she responded. "I missed you." "I missed you so much," he said. "It was so hard, being apart from you." "But we did it," Hermione smiled. "We did it, Draco. We won. There's nothing to stop us now." Draco smiled back and she leaned up to kiss him. He returned her kiss and within a minute they were stumbling toward his bed, clothing thrown to various corners of the room as they fell into the bed together. Hermione's hand wrapped around his cock, jerking it slightly, "I need you," she mumbled against his lips. He happily obeyed, his hand moving to tease her entrance and finding that despite their lack of foreplay, she was quite ready for him. He groaned into her mouth and he shifted to be on top of her. In one easy motion he was buried inside her and they both groaned loudly in pleasure. "Oh Hermione," his head dropped to her neck, "Fuck yes." Her legs wrapped around his waist, "You feel so good," she gasped before groaning again as he pulled nearly all the way out of her before entering her again at a torturously slow pace. "Faster." His last coherent thought was that their climaxes would be faster than usual before he succumbed to the rhythm of their bodies. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% When they collapsed against one another Draco pulled the covers out and over them before turning onto his side and pulling her against him. "We are never sleeping apart again," he declared. "Deal," Hermione said, her eyes closing as she succumbed to the exhaustion the day had left her with. With a smile on his lips, and the witch he loved in his arms, Draco Malfoy fell into an easy, happy sleep for the first time in over a year. The next morning Hermione woke feeling safe. She immediately recognized that she had not had the nightmare that had haunted her the past months. Ever since the Snatchers had found them, Hermione had been having horrible nightmares of the torture Bellatrix inflicted on her. She smiled against him. It felt good, waking up with him. He shifted and tightened his hold and she looked up to see his eyes open, "Good morning," she smiled. "Good morning beautiful," he grinned. "This is amazing." "It is," she agreed. "Today we have to tell people," she sighed. Draco regarded her drop in mood, "Are you okay with that?" Frankly, if his friends and family rejected him or Hermione, he was happy to cut them off. But Hermione, despite her strength, had a softer heart than he did. And it was undeniable that her magical life heavily featured the Weasleys and Potter. "Draco, Ron abandoned us on the Hunt. Harry was obsessed with staring at Ginny's dot on that damn map," Hermione gazed at him, "I love you. And if they react as I expect them to, then I will choose you over them with no regrets." He smiled and she gently kissed him, "I will always choose you." "Good because I'd choose you too," he hugged her to him, "you're stuck with me Granger." "I'm fine with that Malfoy," she quipped before kissing him again, "we need a shower." "Together? That sounds like fun," he gave her a lascivious grin. "It will be. I'll need you to warm me up," she said, arching her back so that her breasts would rub against him. Draco's silver eyes turned as dark as storm clouds as he gazed at his lover hungrily. "To the bathroom, Draco." "Yes dear," he exited the bed, scooped her up, and they entered the bathroom to shower. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Hermione savored the feeling of showering properly. It felt so good. "Enjoying a proper shower?" Draco asked. "Mmm you have no idea," she tilted her head back to let the water rinse the shampoo out of her hair. "I've missed this." "More than you missed me?" He asked. "Yes," she admitted, making her boyfriend mope. She opened her eyes, "Draco you underestimate living a life being unable to shower every day." Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought. He knew he was very pampered. What Hermione had experienced sounded like hell to him. "You'll never have to experience that again," he promised her. "I won't let it happen." Hermione felt his fingers in her hair, "I'm not a witch who needs to be taken care of." "Which makes me want to take care of you even more," he countered. Hermione smiled and leaned into him, "Oh Hermione," he groaned as her very inviting looking breasts pressed into his chest. "Fucking hell I want you." "You can have me," she said, her lips parting as Draco leaned down to kiss her. Her arms slid around his neck as he lifted her up. Hermione moaned as his erection pressed against her. This was going to be a very long shower. Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, Daphne Greengrass, and Pansy Parkinson entered Draco's dorm room looking for him. The Slytherins had returned that morning and the quartet's first thoughts had been to find Draco. Pansy and Daphne's eyes immediately honed in on the female undergarments that were on the floor tangled up with Draco's clothes. The two girls shared a look. They'd both suspected that Draco had a secret girlfriend since back in fifth year. "Maybe he's not here," Theo said, not seeing the signs of a female presence that the girls did. "Nah his bed's unmade and his clothes are on the floor," Blaise pointed out. "He's probably in the shower." And he's not alone , Pansy and Daphne both thought. A loud groan was heard from the bathroom and the four friends froze. Theo frowned in confusion, "What was that?" "Fuck yesâ€¦Draco!" Blaise grinned. His friend was shagging a witch in the shower. Not a bad way to celebrate the end of the war, he had to admit. He wondered who Draco was with though. He never mentioned there being a witch he was interested in. Pansy and Daphne, meanwhile, were certain the voice was familiar. They just couldn't quite place it with the door muffling her voice. Theo shifted uncomfortably. He was from a very conservative family and sex was not a topic ever discussed or meant to be discussed. It was private. "Maybe we should leave," Theo suggested. They heard the shower turn off. "No way," Blaise sat on the bed, "I want to see who he's with." Theo remained hovering at the door while the others stayed in the room, Pansy scourgifying Draco's robe from the night before in case the female only had a towel on her. Whoever she was, Pansy would never subject a witch to Blaise's leer. Especially not if she was seeing Draco. She had known Draco since they were in nappies and she knew how possessive he was. Blaise lacked a filter and that would draw Draco's ire. She situated herself near the bathroom door to mitigate Blaise's stupidity. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% When the door opened to reveal the bathroom's occupants the four Slytherins' eyes widened, "Granger?!" Blaise and Theo spluttered, shocked at what their eyes were seeing. As Pansy had thought, Hermione Granger only had a Slytherin towel wrapped around her body. Pansy opened the robe up and forced herself to use the first name of the witch she was now certain Draco had been with since fifth year, "Here you go Hermione. I cast cleaning charms on it when Blaise insisted on staying in here." Hermione alternated holding the towel with one hand as she slid her arms through the sleeves while Pansy held the robe for her, before closing it and turning to Pansy with a grateful look on her face, "Thank you Pansy." Pansy nodded, no malice in her face at all. The war had changed many things for her but already word was spreading that Hermione Granger had killed Bellatrix Lestrange. Bellatrix was considered the most powerful of Voldemort's followers and Hermione Granger, muggleborn teenager, had not only withstood her torture but had ultimately killed her. At the very least, Hermione deserved respect in Pansy's eyes. "So Hermione's who you started seeing secretly in fifth year?" Daphne asked Draco. She'd run her mind through who it could be while they waited for the door to open and the list had been short. Granger had been top of Daphne's list. Only dating a muggleborn would have enraged Draco's family. Half-bloods weren't ideal to pureblood parents, but they were still acceptable when there were so few families left. Beyond that, Daphne knew Draco well. She'd known him just as long as Pansy had and she knew that Draco would want a witch he saw as his equal. Narcissa Malfoy might play the perfect demure pureblood wife but she was very much Lucius' equal when it came to magical prowess and in life. Knowing how much Draco loved his mother had Daphne certain he would want something similar in his own relationship. Draco was the top boy in their class and Hermione was the top of their class period. Daphne could think of no other muggleborns who could hold Draco's attention for long and that made Hermione the only name on the list. Draco had not expected to see his friends there and was immediately ready to be on the defensive but seeing Pansy help Hermione into his robe he realized that at the very least his two female best friends were reserving judgment. When Daphne questioned him Draco realized they knew much more than he thought they did. Theo and Blaise, meanwhile, still looked shocked and speechless. He nodded his head, "Yes. Hermione and I
