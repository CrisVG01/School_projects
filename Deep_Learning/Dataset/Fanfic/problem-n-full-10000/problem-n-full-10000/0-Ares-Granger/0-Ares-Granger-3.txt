Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, my name is not JK Rowling, and I make no money from this fic. A/N- This fic is inspired by an unfinished fic (Failing Authorities by emmaalg) I came across when I first got into the Dramione pairing. While it was more of a Ron-centered fic, I liked the setup and I soon found myself writing my own fic, though I obviously went full-on Dramione and moved Ron to the sidelines. Okay so time for the setup. Takes place post-war, begins around mid to late July, and canon pairings only count if I like them so obviously this is AU (though the pairing was probably the first sign this is AU). This chapter is longer than I'd usually post for a first chapter, but this is almost like a prologue as the next chapter jumps to when the new Hogwarts year begins. So a bit of a time skip will happen in chapter 2. Hermione Granger frowned at the stone. She was helping rebuild Hogwarts and because the castle was so magical, magic couldn't really be used on the castle walls to rebuild them. This stone, however, was far too large for her to lift on her own. Hell, even one of the boys couldn't. "Here we've got this," she turned to look at Draco Malfoy and Blaise Zabini who together lifted the stone up and into place. Hermione watched as they fit it into its snug spot and once finished she found them lifting her up to add the magical mortar to the top of the stone as they rebuilt a section of the wall. "Okay I'm done," she said, and they helped her down. Hermione's job was mostly to lay down the magical mortar but she could put stones up too; unless they were huge like the one Blaise and Draco had just put into place. "Thanks guys." %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% It hadn't been easy, getting used to working with Draco and Blaise. But they agreed to put aside their prejudices and she agreed to let the past go. Both boys were actually gentlemen, at their core, and Hermione felt safe working with them. They neither idolized her nor did they mock her. They didn't obey her blindly and they made her laugh. Draco and Blaise together was a bit like Fred and George. Plenty of laughter as they took digs at each other and mocked one another. After everything that had happened, they needed the laughter. And for Hermione, it was hard to blame either young man for their actions in the war. They'd been raised from birth to hate muggleborns and muggles; Draco told her as they began working together he'd never even met a half-blood before Hogwarts. Their parents had indoctrinated them in a sheltered environment their entire lives. So Hermione had forgiven them. She could even forgive their parents, as Lucius and Narcissa had both been raised by people who were even worse bigots; although Draco and Blaise weren't eager to forgive their parents. Hermione had began teaching them about the muggle world, as they were on probation and living in a muggle flat was a part of their probation. Hermione had impressed upon Kingsley that education, forgiveness, and understanding had to follow war or else there'd be a third war. Living in the muggle flat and returning to Hogwarts for their NEWTS was all that their probation entailed. Especially when both boys volunteered to help rebuild the school so that classes could resume come September. For them it was atonement. "No sign of the Wonder Dorks again?" Blaise asked. Hermione's flat was in his and Draco's building. They'd both quickly acclimated to the muggle world as the boys got to enjoy video games, television, movies, music, and muggle amusement parks. They were enamored and Hermione liked that they weren't humoring her; they sincerely enjoyed muggle popular culture. "Of course not," Hermione frowned. "Who would have thought we'd fight through a war together and then start to distance ourselves from one another?" Draco put her on his shoulders and Blaise handed her the smaller stones which she put in place, "Well you're living in the muggle world, you're rebuilding Hogwarts, and you're attending seventh year for your NEWTS," Draco said, stepping to the left when she tapped his left shoulder. "They're basically the opposite of you, though they're not destroying Hogwarts." Blaise smirked, "Besides, Weasel in the muggle world? He says he's not a bigot but he does think muggles are beneath wizards. He just doesn't think muggleborns are." "If Hermione was doing my homework and keeping my neck above water with my grades I wouldn't think muggleborns are beneath purebloods either," Draco pointed out. "I don't think you're inferior Hermione," he added quickly. "I know Draco," Hermione patted the top of his head before she lay more of the mortar down. "They both love the fame and the attention. Ron's the worst, of course, but it's almost like they're two different people," she said. She had spent more time with Draco and Blaise in the past month than she'd spent with Harry and Ron since the Final Battle because of her friends' new attitudes. "Voldemort is no longer hanging like a dark cloud over Potter," Blaise pointed out. "He was a horcrux. Maybe the boy you knew so well was only like that because he was a horcrux." "Nagini didn't act at all like a snake sometimes when she was living at the manor," Draco recollected. "So maybe Potter was the same. He was like someone else as a horcrux which covered up the fact that he's actually always been an obnoxious twit." She laughed at Draco's characterization of Harry. He was like a completely different person since the Final Battle and she wasn't the only one to not like it. Blaise changed the subject, "Hermione have you thought about my proposal?" Hermione bit her lip as she finished with the mortar and gazed at the wall to see it completely repair itself so you couldn't see it had ever been damaged, "I've decided that I'll do it. But you both need dates. Muggle girls will be all over you." Draco and Blaise helped her off Draco's shoulders before Draco asked, "Hermione will you be my date to a muggle nightclub?" She gazed at his dazzling smile. Draco was intelligent, understood her, and had clearly acclimated to the muggle world. It was nice to see that the attraction wasn't one-sided. Hermione smiled, "Why Draco, I would be delighted to be your date." Blaise, knowing his best friend's attraction to the muggleborn witch, wisely stayed silent. Frankly they all deserved happiness after everything they'd gone through and he wouldn't begrudge Draco or Hermione a chance at testing the waters of a relationship after so much playful flirting recently. "Now I need a date," Blaise said. "Any friends in mind Hermione?" "He means that feisty redhead he's always mooning over," Draco whispered conspiratorially to Hermione as they walked toward the front of the castle to eat lunch. Hermione debated setting Blaise up with Ginny. On the one hand, they'd probably hit it off. On the other, she wasn't sure if Ginny was dating Harry or not. Ginny had mourned Fred's loss for two weeks straight before she began to help fix up Hogwarts. Hermione hadn't really talked to her all that much and when she did it was about everything but Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. "I'll see if Ginny's interested," Hermione said to him. Draco winked at her and she flushed slightly. While Hermione wasn't shy, she still wasn't used to getting attention for being a girl. For being Harry Potter's best friend? Yes. For being intelligent? Yes. For looking good in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt? No. So when Draco flirted with her, she almost always blushed. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Ginny joined them for lunch, "How was your morning?" "We finished our section," Draco said proudly. "At this rate the castle will definitely be ready in time for classes to start." Hermione nodded her agreement with Draco's thoughts. It had at first seemed impossible. But now it seemed feasible, even probable. "How was your morning Ginny?" Hermione asked. "I was working on the seventh floor near what used to be the Room of Requirement fixing up the interior," Ginny answered. Because she'd started working later, she did mostly interior work with different groups. "Professor McGonagall found a Transfiguration professor. And a Defense professor too," she added. "Anyone we know?" Hermione asked. "No," Ginny shook her head. "They're both supposed to be really good though." %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% After Blaise and Draco had eaten quite a bit Draco winked at Hermione and stood, "Come on Blaise, let's go report that we're finished and get our new assignment." Blaise made an effort not to look at Ginny and nodded, following his friend. Hermione smiled as they walked away before deciding to be blunt with Ginny, "Ginny, are you single or not?" Ginny blinked in surprise, "Wh-what?" "You and I have talked about many things. None of them are Harry. And I'm asking because I'm taking Draco and Blaise to a muggle nightclub this weekend and Draco's taking me as his date and Blaise needs one. They're both too handsome to let muggle girls near presumably stag. And Blaise likes you," Hermione added quietly. Ginny was speechless. She flushed and looked down. "My relationship with Harry is…" Ginny paused, "I don't know. I only see him in mixed company." "You mean Ron," Hermione said. "Yeah. Never alone, never…he kisses my cheek like he kisses yours. I wanted him for so long but ever since he lost the horcrux it's like he's someone else," Ginny said. "And I don't like who he's becoming. He's not the boy I fell for. Now he's a better mannered version of Ron." Hermione shuddered at the thought. She shook her head to clear the image, "Well, how about you come with us and have fun?" "I could use a night of fun," Ginny admitted. "Great," Hermione smiled. "You can come to my place and we can get dressed for the club together since the boys already live together." "Sounds good to me," Ginny smiled. She was already looking forward to the weekend. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% "Ginny's coming with us this weekend," Hermione told Draco and Blaise when she found them outside the Great Hall, "Where are we assigned now?" "Headmistress McGonagall wants us to help out some of the other groups. Longbottom's group is apparently really slow so she's hoping we can speed them up," Draco said while Blaise tried to hide his excitement that Ginny was coming. "She also said the castle is going to offer up an eighth year dorm for those of us who would have taken our NEWTS last year. Apparently the four houses won't have enough beds given how many students are returning from the lower years. And the incoming first class is big." "Well I would prefer our own eighth year dorm anyway. We're all adults, so we shouldn't be housed with kids anymore." Draco and Blaise nodded in agreement as they walked out of the castle. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Neville's group, consisting of Neville, Hannah Abbott, and Ernie MacMillan, was clearly slower than the others. And they were all awkward and pureblood. Not a one had ever been involved in manual labor before. Draco, Blaise, and Hermione all took comfort they were never as awkward as these three and immediately went to work. As Draco and Blaise lifted a large stone into place Hermione wondered what it said about Blaise and Draco that they weren't afraid to sweat or exert themselves while three people who were on the side of the light could barely do anything. She was certain their earlier assertions about Ron could be applied to the three in front of them. "Okay come on Hermione," Blaise said. Holding onto the mortar Hermione hopped onto Draco's back and, after so much practice doing
