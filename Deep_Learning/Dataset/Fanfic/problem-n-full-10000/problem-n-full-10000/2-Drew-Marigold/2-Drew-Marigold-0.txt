Written by: Drew and Al's Waiter Summary: Through the biggest plot hole imaginable, the entire Fellowship find themselves on the road... in a pea-green hippie van?! When they stop to ask for directions in the most remote little town, they meet up with two... unusual and... unorthodox characters. Spoilers for those who have not read the books, like when Frodo... *twack* "Don't _tell _ them!" ... oh... sorry. Warning: This story is a... not a self-"insert" per se, more like self-"sucked in". Rejoice, no Legolas romance! Disclaimer: AW and I are truly sorry. We were attacked by merciless Nuzguls and were forced to write this tag-along story. Fortunately for you, this is not a 10th, or even an 11th member fic... at least, not the way you'd imagine it. We're not that void of intelligence. All of the Lord of the Rings characters belong to dear ol' Tollers and no one else. Drew and AW belong to themselves and like it that way. Al's Wait and Eat, Al and Al's Waiter are based on the show *ReBoot*, but we warped them significantly, so they are likely no longer property of Mainframe Entertainment. Sticksville is a fictional place and always will be. Enjoy the random time travel, the plot holes, the RV's and the ... moronic escapades. ~*~*~*~*~ Chapter 1: Welcome to Sticksville... Population: YOU "Picture it: Sicily, the year was 1946...." "That's not right." "Ok...try: my backyard party, three years ago..." "No, that's still not right... It was last summer, and it wasn't anywhere near the backyard... not till much later." "Oh, fine. You and your obsession with details. I still like my introduction better. It had more character." "Character, yes. Plagiarism, yes. Facts, flair, flavour...NO!" "Kill joy." "Who's telling this story? Me, or you?" "You can tell it, so we get the 'facts' straight, and I'll make sure it's fun." *turns head... notices readers* "Pssst... they're here." "Oh, hi! We should probably introduce ourselves... I'm Drew." "And I'm AW... (the fun one)" Drew: "And we're here to... Hey! I'm fun." AW: "No, you're a teacher." Drew: "I'm still fun. I make my daughter laugh." AW: "She's 12 months old, and she'll laugh at toast." Drew: "I'm still fun. You have to be fun to MST. I MST. Therefore, I. Am. Fun. Anyways... as I was saying... *glares at AW* We are here to tell you a story..." AW: "A story that happened to a friend of a friend of mine..." Drew: "Stop it! It did not, and you're going to get us into trouble with a lot of high-priced, fancy-talking lawyers if you're not careful!" AW: "Okay, fine. I see what you're doing... kinda like Freakazo- *glances at Drew* Can't say it or I'll be *makes air quotes* sued. But, I'm reading ahead, and this is good stuff... good stuff.." Drew: *wearyingly* "AW. You're doing it again." AW: *sulks* "Fine. You start it." Drew: "Alright... Um..." *looks sheepishly at Al* "How did it start?" AW: "You were temping at the Rent-it-all dealership... *turns to audiance* *cheesie voice over guy* "Where our motto is: You can rent it all, but only one at a time!" *big toothpaste commercial grin* "And Al's Wait 'n' Eat Diner was closed for lunch, so I was over keeping you company." *to audience* "Al's Wait 'n' Eat... I'm a Waiter... Hence, *air quotes* Al's Waiter!" *laugh track* Both: *look around for laughing people* Drew: "Riiiiight... *flashback waves* AW: *voice over* Ohh.. I hate those effects... I think I'm going to hurl. Drew: *voice over* Have my BSB (1). We don't have time for you to leave, now. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The pea-soup green Hippie van lurched forward, stopped, lurched forward, stopped, lurched forward, and shuddered to a halt. The engine sputtered, wheezed, coughed, spewed black smoke... and died. Eight of the strangest people (and I use the term loosely) pushed each other out of the rusty doors and took a collective gasp of air. After stretching out the various kinks acquired from being crammed into that sardine can for who knows how long, they staggered towards the Diner. Upon discovering it was closed for the noon hour, a plethora of colourful vocabulary rose up from the group. A short bearded man in a metal hat stomped back to the van, popped the hood, started muttering and using an... axe? ... to wave away the billowing smoke. Just like every other lunch hour, AW sat on my table, I sat behind it, and we shared lunches. We snickered. Watching tourists 'not eat' at the Diner always struck us as funny. (The locals knew better than to go during meal times.) The blond one must have heard us, because his head snapped around, and he looked right at us. AW and I immediately put on our poker faces and waited as he strode over angrily to confront us. The rest of the group watched him walk across the parking lot. The short ones were the first to follow him, leaning on each other for support, moaning something about not having eaten since elevenses. The old man seemed inclined to wait under the Diner's awning, and the dark one chased after the blond, catching up before he had crossed half the lot. "What do you think you are doing?" the dark one thundered, waving his hands in the air, "Striiiiiding over here. You think anyone can striiiide? It takes years to perfect. You are making a mockery of striding." "Look," replied the blond, not pausing, and using the tone my aunt uses with the mental patients, "just because you got us lost in Western Qu√©bec, where none of us could communicate with anyone, does not give you the right to take your bad mood out on me. I am not the navigator. You wouldn't even allow a map in the van, Mr. 'I'm a Ranger... I need no map.' So, if you don't mind, I will acquire directions from those... folk over there." We watched them approach as we fought a losing battle to maintain our poker faces. We couldn't help ourselves; the whole scene was just too absurd for words. The two tall tourists stopped in front of the table. The dark one was fuming, and the blond was ignoring him beautifully. "Pardon me for interrupting," the blond started, even though he wasn't interrupting anything, and he knew it, "Where are we? And would you be so kind as to explain why this eating establishment is closed at the noon hour?" At this point, AW was slurping his shake industriously, desperate to hide the smirk on his face. Since he couldn't be polite and civilized, I was left the job of explaining the idiocy of the Diner. "Well, Sirs," I said as respectfully as I could manage, "you are in Sticksville, just outside the Canadian capital of Ottawa. And as for the Diner, it is a very unorthodox situation: the owner, Al, likes to enjoy his meals in uninterrupted peace... so, he closes his doors while he eats, and opens when he has finished. Knowing how slowly he moves, it should be open within the hour... and no later than 2 o'clock." I beamed at them., pleased with myself for having finished this speech without being hampered by a nasty case of the giggles. And AW, still working on his drink, wasn't helping to alleviate the hilarity. They stood there motionless, staring at us, as they worked to digest that information. As we waited for a reaction, four short ones finally made their way to the table. Suddenly, the dark one sprang to life and leaned over the table, coming up nose to nose with AW. AW looked up from the frantic slurping, paused, and in trying to internalise the laugh that bubbled up, he succeeded only in snorting blueberry energy shake out his nose. He jumped off the table, grabbed a serviette and ran off towards my car, chortling and exclaiming, "Ow! It burns, it burns!" Deprived of his focus, the dark one turned to me. "Two o'clock?" he bellowed, "That's nearly two hours from now." Upon hearing this, the four newly arrived participants gasped and collapsed on the ground, whining, "Two hours?" "I'm not going to make it that long," and, "I wasn't this hungry on the way to Mordor!" The blond one looked down on the heap of short people and shook his head. "You just ate an hour ago." He said, exasperated, "How can you still be hungry?" One of them looked up, "But, Legolas, it was Chinese buffet. Everyone knows you get hungry half an hour after eating it. That was two half an hours ago." Finding this entire exchange extremely amusing, I struggled to keep a straight face as the dark one continued to rant, "What kind of restaurant closes when people are hungry? How do you expect to make any money? What are we supposed to do? Why is that guy," he pointed to AW, "still running around yelling, 'it burns'? What is wrong with him? Why are you just sitting there?" The blond, apparently named Legolas, placed a hand on his shoulder and said calmly, "Aragorn, leave the poor girl alone. Getting angry never solved anything. And besides," he added logically, "she works for a different establishment. Look at her shirt." Aragorn, so addressed, blinked and stopped shouting long enough for me to see what he looked like with his mouth closed. Taking advantage of the sudden silence, I launched into my sales pitch schpiel, "Yes, thank you. Welcome to 'Rent-It-All,' where you can rent it all, but only one at a time. We have," and I proceeded to rattle off the contents of the shed and parking lot behind me, "a lawnmower, vacuum cleaner, iron, weed whacker, roto-rooter, VW beetle, roto-tiller, crock pot, lawn chair, speed boat, toaster, porta-potty, our John Deer ride-on mower is out right now, R. V...." I was starting to loose my audience, "...hub cap, portable air conditioner, crash test dummy, tanning be-" "Oh no!" gasped one of the short people at my feet, "We forgot Boromir in the van!" With that, he grabbed a random hand from the pile and yanked the corresponding body out, and dragged him over to the now silent, still smoking, van. They clamoured inside and climbed over the seats to the back. While we were waiting for them to reemerge, one of the remaining short ones asked, "Pardon me, Lady, but why was everything you mentioned in the singular form, if you don't mind my asking." "Oh, that's easy," I replied cheerfully, "because we only have one of each of every item. That's why you can only rent one thing at a time." He merely nodded reflectively as he gazed at the impedimenta available for rent. His companion pulled at his sleeve, "Look, Master Frodo. She also sells lemonade," he said, indicating a handpainted sign taped to the table. Pausing thoughtfully, he then asked worriedly, "Do you think she has more than one glass?" "I don't know, Sam," Frodo replied, turning back to me, "Will we all be able to have a glass? Or will we need to share?" I giggled. "The lemonade stand is my own venture. I have enough cups for all of you," I replied, "Would you like pre-made for 50 cents, or would you like to do-it-yourself, for 25 cents?" Aragorn had listened to this conversation wordlessly, glancing from one speaker to the other with his mouth wide open. The 'do-it-yourself lemonade stand' seemed to force him to share another opinion-filled outburst. "This is the worst rental agency I have ever seen! And believe me, I've seen plenty," he roared, "A Diner that closes for meals, and a rental place with one of everything? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS TOWN?!?" "Look around you," AW said calmly approaching from behind, causing Aragorn to jump, "does this village look big enough to need two trampolines?" He walked between Legolas and Aragorn, and reclaimed his space on the table,
