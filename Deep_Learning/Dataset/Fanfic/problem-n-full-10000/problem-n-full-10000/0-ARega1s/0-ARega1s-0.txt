How Harry Got a Date Well, my friends, this will be my first Harry Potter Fanfic. Not gonna lie, part of me is worried on how well this will be received. With that being said, this is just a fun little one shot I had on my mind for a while but never thought to write out. I do not own Harry Potter or the cover image. R&R and Enjoy. ***In the Halls of Hogwarts, a Week before The Yule Ball*** The student population seemed to be more lively and festive for this Christmas than any other year because of the up and coming Yule Ball. The young men and women were looking over at each other and talking about who to take to the dance. A few of the brave souls or those pressured by their peers made their best advances on the dates of their choice. To those that managed to claim a date, there was much celebrating and giggling. To those that were turned down, the awkward pauses were lengthy. For the average student, the pressure in finding a date was somewhat uncomfortable. For the Fourth Champion of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry Potter, the pressure was substantially great. For one thing, he had been considered an outcast by most everyone in school (including his supposed best friend, Ron) for having cheated his way into the tournament. Even now, after his performance in the first task, many students continued to leer at him and flash those damnable 'Potter Stinks' badges at him. Ron seemed to have come back around to believe him, if only just. He would stick up for him if Malfoy's ilk or some other scornful students claimed him a cheater. Yet if people were to congratulate him, especially those of the fairer sex, Harry could see the jealousy in his eyes and occasionally hear the barely restrained scoff. Normally, Harry would try to brush this off. Why try and ruin their recently fixed friendship by bringing up his jealousy? Unfortunately for Harry, this tactic was doomed to fail. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione finished up their breakfast in the Great Hall, they began to get ready for their upcoming Transfiguration class. "Were you two able to complete your essays?" The bushy haired girl asked. Harry nodded his head while Ron's face paled. This caused Harry and Hermione to laugh. "Could I quick borrow your's so I could at least hand in something to her?" The redhead asked. "Ron! We are not giving you our homework so you can copy it! Not only is that cheating but all three of us could get in trouble!" He ignored Hermione's answer before turning to his black haired friend. "Come on, Harry. Help a mate out?" This caused Harry to cock his eyebrow. Before he could answer, however, he heard someone call his name. "Harry. Could I talk to you?" Turning around, Harry saw Susan Bones waving him down. Besides the obvious fact that she was in Hufflepuff, she had a lovely mane of red hair and a polite smile on her face when she saw that he had noticed her. "I'll catch up with you two in class." Harry said before walking over to Susan. "Ok but hurry up, Harry. Class starts in five minutes." His bushy haired friend said. Chuckling at her concern, Harry fought his way through the crowd of students before finally making it to Susan. "Good morning, Susan." The boy greeted. "Good morning to you too, Harry." She replied. "Congratulations by the way on your completion of the First Task." "Thank you." Harry said, blushing a little at her compliment. "But I really didn't do anything that impressive. I thought I was just lucky not to be roasted alive or impaled by the Horntail." "Ever the modest one, Harry." She giggled. "You are tied for first place, even beating out Cedric." "Sorry bout that." He mumbled. "What do you have to be sorry for? You beat Ced fair and square." "Just for being in the tournament in general. Taking the glory away from your house." Harry continued. "After hearing about the crazy adventures you and your friends get up to every year, I doubt you intentionally joined this tournament." Susan reassured him. "Thanks for that." He said. "People are only just coming around to realizing the same." "Yeah. I'm sorry to say that I initially agreed with them when your name first came out. But then Ced reassured the house that you were unwillingly entered. It didn't stop most of the house from bullying you but it got through to some of us." "It happens." Harry chuckled. "Mob mentality and such. So what did you want to ask?" "Oh!" Susan said, blushing a little for forgetting her original purpose in talking to Harry. "I was wondering if you might..." "Oi! Harry! You never answered me if I could copy your essay." Ron interrupted, much to the annoyance of Harry and Susan. "The answer is no, Ron." Harry said, thinking his friend would take the answer and leave. "Sorry about that, Susan. What were you going to ask?" "Quite alright, Harry. I was going to ask if you would like..." "Hey, Susan. Since you have a different Transfiguration period than us, could I copy your homework instead?" "No, Weasley! You can't copy my homework! Now please, leave us alone!" Susan snapped, glaring daggers at the freckled redhead. "Fine. Don't go getting your knickers in a twist." Ron said before turning away. "Sorry about that. He can be a bit of..." Susan began to say. " An annoying git?" Harry interjected. "I was going to say an arse but that works too." She said before they both chuckled. "Now hopefully nobody will interrupt us again so you can ask me the question on your mind" Harry said with a smile. "Yeah. So I wanted to know if you would like to go to the Yule Ball with me?" Harry was elated. Somebody wanted to go to the dance with him! Sure, Cho Chang would have been his dream girl to take to the ball but he had heard through the grapevine that Cedric had already claimed her as his date. Still, he, like other boys in his year, fancied Susan nonetheless. Unfortunately, just as he was about to say 'yes', Ron decided to cut in one more time. "Ha! Like Harry would want to go out with a backstabbing 'puff like you! Your lot teased and made fun of him with those stupid badges and such." "Ron, shut up!" Harry hissed, only for it to fall on deaf ears. "Isn't the pot calling the kettle black, Weasley? You did the exact same thing to Harry, didn't you?" Susan shot back. "Yeah...Well..." Ron spluttered, trying to come up with a good comeback. Wether it was to Ron's good fortune or Harry's bad luck, the warning bell rang out. The halls suddenly flooded with students, separating Harry and Ron from Susan. "Come on, mate. Lets get away from that bint." The redhead remark as he pulled his friend along. "No! Wait!" Harry struggled, trying and failing to fight his way up the current of students back to Susan. Yet the crowd was too much for him and he was pushed back to Ron. Crestfallen, he made his way to Transfiguration class. The class itself was fairly boring, simply a review of the topic of their essays before they were given a half an hour to practice. During the practice, Harry was lost in his own little world, trying to think of when he might be able to talk to Susan again. Unfortunately, his schedule for the day for packed until lunch. Sighing in resignation, he returned to his work. ***12:30, The Great Hall*** "Harry, you're doing it again." Hermione said. "Huh? What?" The boy in question said as he turned his head away from Hufflepuff table. His bushy haired friend chuckled at his ignorance to his own actions. "You were looking for Susan again, weren't you." She stated, knowing the answer before even asking. Harry nodded his head. "Go and talk to her. You said she asked you out. Just tell her yes." She said, giving him a reassuring smile. "Yeah." He replied nervously. "I guess I'm still annoyed about Ron interrupting us and the things he said." "I would say I can deal with Ron," She said as they looked over to the third member of their trio. Currently, he was shoveling down a plateful of Shepherd's Pie like it was going out of fashion. "But I have a feeling he will be properly distracted for the next couple of minutes." Chuckling at the truth of her statement, Harry stood up and made his way over to the table of badgers. Most of them ignored him, some of them leered at him, and a few even flashed their 'Potter Stinks' badges at him. Yet the boy didn't care. He had his eyes on one person. "Hey Susan." The boy said in as confident a voice as he could muster. "Oh!" The redheaded girl said, surprised that Harry would try and find her again after her disastrous attempt at asking him out in the morning. "I wanted to start off by saying I'm sorry for how Ron treated you this morning. He was a right git and you didn't do anything to deserve that." "I appreciate your apology, Harry. It bothered me for a little while but, like you said, he's an annoying git." They both had a bit of a laugh at this before, giving Harry a moment to prepare himself before giving her his answer. "As to your question on if I would like to go with you to he ball, my answer is yes." He said, mentally patting himself on the back for not stumbling over his words. Yet he was surprised to see the girl frown at his statement rather than smile. "Is...Is something wrong, Susan?" "I'm...I'm sorry, Harry." The redhead said, on the verge of tears as the words came out. "After our confrontation with Ron and not getting your answer, I wasn't sure if you would still want to go with me to the ball. So when Ernie asked me to the ball, I accepted. If I would have known you would have come to find me afterwards, I would have said no. I'm so, so sorry, Harry." "No. Its not your fault. I should have given you my answer before Ron interrupted. I'm the one who should be sorry." Harry said glumly. "No! I will not let you put the blame on yourself!" Susan said passionately. "Ron is the one at fault. If he hadn't cut in, then we could be together. As it stands now...it would be rude to Ernie to say no to him now." "I understand." The boy said, giving her a sad smile. "You are a true gentleman, Harry Potter." She replied before standing up and embracing him. "I envy the girl you take to the ball." Before he could reply, however, the 5 minute warning bell rang. The two sighed in frustration before separating. "I'll see you later, Susan. I've got Potions with the Slytherins next." Harry said, reluctance evident in his voice. "Goodbye, Harry." She said softly before watching him walk away. Susan sighed. She knew she should have waited, knew she should have told Ernie no. Yet she had been so worried about Ron's words and insults affecting Harry's decision that she had decided to go with someone else. "I know this may seem like a small consolation, but you do gain Harry's love and affection in another world." Came a voice from behind her. Turning around, the redhead was surprised to see a young Ravenclaw talking to her. "What did you say?" Susan asked. "I said that you and Harry get together in another world." The girl replied before skipping away, her blonde hair swaying too and fro. The Hufflepuff was confused by
