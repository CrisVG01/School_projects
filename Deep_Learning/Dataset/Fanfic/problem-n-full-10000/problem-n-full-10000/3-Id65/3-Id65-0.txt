Ok guys, I worked really hard on this fic. I hope you like it. Shout out to Percyjacksonlover13purple, Who helped- well with basically everything. You know when people thought of the apocalypse they imagined a bunch of teens running around, Killing zombies and whatever was taking over the world, and they'd all survive, somehow winning a war when there's 10 of them. I'm here to tell you that's bull. Complete and total. I grip Charity's Hand as we run. Keep her innocent. My father's last words. The sun sends its last fiery rays over the overgrown and abandoned streets. I hear the groans and moans of the zombies. I pull into an abandoned street near an 18-wheeler. I crouch down to Charity. "Charity. You have to go and climb on the roof of that truck. You only come down when I call you ok?" I ask her. Her big chocolate eyes beg. "I want to stay." She says. "MUUUHHH" I hear them. "Don't question me! GO!" I yell. And Charity runs. I know this is probably my last fight. I kill the first row easily, and am about to kill the others when- "NO! ANNABETH! ANNABETH!" I hear Charity scream. I hear the truck doors slamming shut. "CHARITY!" I yell. With a single glance at the approaching zombies, I run over to the truck and enter. A man leans over Charity, his back turned to me. His shotgun on the ground in front of me. I pick it up and cock it. "Turn around slowly." I say. He does, smirking and hands up. I can barely see his face in this poor lighting. "Let her go" I say. "Annabeth Don't!" Charity says. "She doesn't want to go." The guy says. "We've met enough survivors. Excuse me if I don't trust men around a 12 year old." I say. I hear the Zombies groan. "Duck" I tell charity. She does and I turn. 3 of them. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. I fire repeatedly. I turn back to the guy. He has friends now. Great. "Now. Give me back my sister and we'll be on our way" I say. "You used all the bullets" The first guy said. "Great." I say. I toss him his gun and grab Charity's hand. "Run" I say. "Hey! Wait!" One of them calls. "What?" I ask. We're almost out. "When did you learn to shoot like that?" He asks. "40 seconds ago" I say. And we're out. "Wait. They were trying to help me!" Charity says. He follows us out. Just for once- "Yeah. Do you remember what happened last time we got offered a ride?" I ask. Charity nods. "Yeah." She says. "So we don't talk to them." I say. "How about one's offering jobs?" I turn to see the guy. Or I assume it's the same guy. His looks- hot. Tan skin, and he's very muscular, His Black hair falls haphazardly. His eyes are a sea green. He wears a bullet-proof vest. "Guess I should have aimed for the head" I say. "Well? Do you want a job?" He asks. "Why?" I ask. "Protection. For your sister." He says. I eye him. As in an I-don't-trust-you eye him. "Hmm. Go with the band that kidnapped her? Or tried. No." I say. "No. that's what I was trying to say! He was helping me" Charity says. I eye her know. "I wasn't trying to hurt her." The guy says. "Charity stays safe." I say. He nods. I narrow my eyes. "The last people we met was a group of men. Who tried to take advantage of us? There not around anymore. Understand?" I ask. He nods. "You can come out now" I say. The 3rd guy peeks out from the truck. "Man. Where did the term blondes are dumb and giggly come from?" He asks. The 2nd guy comes from the other side of the truck. "Aww Leo. I'm a blonde." He says. "I mean chicks." He says. "Well you should tell us your names." I say. The 1st guy says, "Percy" The second guy is already back In the truck but yells "Jason!" and the third guy, who looks like someone who can burn down a whole town with a paperclip and a ball of lint, says "Leo. The awesome" He says. "Can you burn down a building with a ball of lint and a paperclip?" I wonder aloud. Leo steps back. "Whoa. Arsonist much?" he asks. "Well. Can you?" I ask. "Probably" He says. I look down at charity. "Stay away from him." I say. "I'm Annabeth. This is Charity" I say. I turn to Percy. "Where are we going? What vehicle are we taking? When are we leaving?" I ask in rapid fire. "Camp on main land. This baby. Now" He says patting the truck. "Come on." I say. Percy blinks. "You're just going to climb on after that?" he asks. "I don't have any choice" I say. I point behind me at the approaching zombies and grab Leo's gun. "Charity. Truck now." I say. "No. You know there not human. So you wouldn't be breaking your promise if you let me-" She starts. "Not Now Charity. Truck now!" I say. She gets in reluctantly. Percy comes next to me, as Leo runs towards the front of the truck. "What's up with Charity?" He asks. 'You mean other than the fact she wants to become a killer? Nothing much" I say. I spot the rest of the Zombies coming. . BANG. "You mean Zombies?" he asks. "She's not killing. That's what it means. You want me? She stays safe. She's staying clean and pure for as long as I'm still kicking" I say. BANG. BANG. BANG. "Hmm." Is that all he says? I glance at him. "What? Scared?" I ask. Let em know that we're still Rock n Roll BANG. BANG. BANG. "Never." He says. I don't care about my makeup I like it better with my jeans all ripped up Don't know how to keep my mouth shut You say so what (What) BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. BANG. "Nice shooting." He says. "Thanks" I reply. I don' t care if I'm misfit I like it better than the hipster of all shit I am the mother fucking princess You still love me BANG. BANG. BANG. "Come on! The trucks ready!" Jason yells. Some some how It's a little different when I'm with you You know what I really am all about You know how it really goes Some some way We'll be getting out of this town one day You're the only that I want with me You know how the story goes BANG. BANG. BANG. Then we jump and roll into the back of the truck, the doors are slammed shut and Leo takes off like a madman. Percy leans over and turns on some electric lanterns stuck to the ceiling. Jason goes to where there's a long line of weapons and starts putting things away. "You ok?" I ask Charity. She nods. Percy nods to mattresses on the floor. "If you're tired." He says. Charity plods over and falls asleep instantly. "How long have you been running?" He asks. I sigh and fall on the mattress next to his. "Since it started." I say. "Yeah. We started a week early." Percy says. I turn to face him. "You knew?" I ask. He shakes his head. "We were going backpacking. We were way up in the mountains. We saw the smoke, and we heard on the radio. We hadn't met anyone so we made camp. It was actually ok for a month or so. Then we needed more supplies. That's where were going" he says. I nod. "The camp is still active?" I ask. "Yeah. Now it's our temporary camp. We leave to base camp when things heat up on main land." He says. "Why are you telling me?" I ask. "I dunno. Why did you agree to come with us?" He asks. "My one job is to protect Charity. Nothing else. You offer protection. That's all she needs. I can get her food and water." I say. He nods. "You tired?" He asks me. "What do you think? We haven't had more than 2 hours sleep in months." I say. He Smiles. "I'm gonna hit the rack too. But-"He waves a handheld radio. "If this makes any sound, just answer it and wake me up" He says. "Easy-Peasy" I say. Jason walks back in. He gives me two blankets. "Here. There really warm" He says. "Thanks" I say. I get up, though it's not easy when the truck is moving. I cover Charity with a blanket and then collapse onto my bed, and am in a dreamless sleep, thank god in no time. SEVREAL HOURS PASS ( I just assume that you say over with each thing. ) "Seaweed? You alive? Over." A voice crackles. I jolt awake and look around. There's no light but I fumble around and find the radio. "Seaweed? Come on. Over." The girl's voice says. I need a code name "Wise girl here. Waking Up seaweed Brain. Over" I say. "Oh! Finally they find a girl. Over." Her voice says. "Wake up Percy" I say. Nothing. I kick his bed. "OW!" He says. Someone laughs over the radio. "Stop being a sissy. Over." She says. "Pinecone that wasn't very nice. Over." "Having Wise Girl Kick you was very smart. Over." Percy turns on a lantern as Pinecone says "Report." "Regional amount of supplies, heading to temp camp as we speak, 2 new members, Wise girl and Underage" Pinecone groans "Underage? Are you an idiot?" She asks Percy glances at me "It was a- Package deal. Wise girl refused without her sister." He says. I nod. "Fine. How many BDs?" "About 300. I lost count." "That many?" "Wise girl packs a punch. And a few other things" Percy says checking me out. "Say that again and I'll snap you in half" Pinecone laughs "Good one Wise Girl. Now. I'll have someone prepare a room." "Good. Make sure it's 2 beds, or wise girl will become an insomniac." "Whatever. Sunshine wants you to keep an eye out for fresh Supplies" "Doesn't he have enough?" Another voice yells "When you have to be amputated with no pain meds I'm not giving you a stick" "Shut up Sunshine" Sunshine must have left. "Rainbow also wants you to look for Tack" "We shouldn't Let Repair boy come up with the Call signals." "Now you notice that" Pinecone says sneezing "Is beauty queen on her throne?" Percy asks. "Yup. And she wants a new name." "Not happening." "I know. Cereal Called from Base, says they need us there. Soon" Percy frowns and asks "How'd Cereal make contact?" "Used up two months' worth of power to extend the signal." "Any news on Delightful and Dead Man?" He asks Pinecone sighs "No. Not a thing." She says Percy rubs his temples like he has a headache. "Okay. Thanks Pinecone. We'll check in at Sunshine's favorite time." "No Problem. Then Dead Man's Fav?" Pinecone asks. "Yeah. Bye" Percy says. He hangs up. "That's a lot of call signs" I say. Percy nods. "Yeah. Repair boy is Leo, I'm seaweed and Jason is sparky" He says. I smirk. Jason sits up. "Wha-?" he asks. "Pipers fine" Percy says. Jason sighs. "So she's good?" He asks. "Yeah No report on Clarisse and Nico, and Katie used up some power to call in and say that there gonna starve in a few months. We need to get there fast" Percy says. Jason nods. "Anything else?" he asks. "Will and Butch need more supplies" Percy says. Jason groans. "There both critical. Great. I say Annabeth goes and tells Leo" Jason says. I jerk my head up "But we're still moving" I say. Jason and Percy share a smile and point upwards. FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER "This is a bad Idea" I say. Charity watches from her bed
