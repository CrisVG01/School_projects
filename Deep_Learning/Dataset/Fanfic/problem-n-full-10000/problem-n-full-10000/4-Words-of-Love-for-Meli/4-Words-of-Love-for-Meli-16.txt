Summary: When Dr. Edward Cullen becomes stranded in the small, shitty town of Forks, South Carolina, he may realize it isn't so shitty after all. This story is written for, and dedicated to, Melistories. Dear Meli, We may not know you on a personal level, but we've learned of your fight. We've been in awe of you and your strength, grace and courage since we heard. We wanted you to know that we're here, thinking of you and that you are in our prayers. This is a little something we hope you'll enjoy and that it helps remind you that we care. That you're not forgotten and we're pulling for you! Lissa & Fyre I don't know what I was thinking making this drive instead of flying. It's hot as fuck and the sun beating down isn't helping. Thankfully, it should be setting soon. It was really stupid to leave my top down. I should've had it up and the AC blasting. I needed to get out of DC, and when this convention was mentioned, I jumped on it. I figured driving would be good. I love my car and don't get to drive her nearly enough in the city. Plus, I could use the fresh air and time to clear my head. Being a doctor at a major hospital isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm busy all the time, get very little recognition and never feel as though I get to spend enough time with the patients before they're shoved out the door to make room for new ones. I've thought about getting out of the city, but I sure as fuck couldn't live in a small town like the ones I've been driving through. In my mind, all the people are one step away from the family in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . I really should've been paying more attention to my driving instead of getting lost in my head, because suddenly, a movement on my left surprises me. A deer jumps out and stands right in the middle of the road. Swerving, I manage to miss the thing but end up sliding down an embankment instead. Getting out, I go around to check the damage. "Fuck," I swear. One of my tires is flat and the whole front fender is a crumpled mess. Heading back to the driver's seat, I get in and try to see what I can do. After several minutes of various attempts, it's clear I'm stuck. I check my phone and see I have no reception. Just fucking great. Looks like I'm going to be walking. Luckily, I just passed through a town. Hopefully, it won't be too small or shitty to be able to help. After making sure everything is all locked up, I start walking back the way I just came. After almost an hour, I finally see a Welcome to Forks sign. At least, now I know where the fuck I am. The sun is setting, but I hope I can find someone who can help me out tonight. I really don't want to leave my baby on the side of the road. The light from a diner down the road draws my attention so I start making my way there. When I enter, I head straight up to the counter. There's a tiny woman with short hair, and at first, I'm not sure she's old enough to be working until I get closer. It's then that I can see the fine lines around her eyes. She's probably in her forties, but still very pretty. She approaches me right away. "Hey. Welcome to Alice's. Here's our menu. Can I get ya somethin' to drink?" "Actually, I was hoping you could help me out. My car is stuck a couple miles down the highway and I was wondering if there's someone who could help me." She turns toward the opening where a blond man is putting up plates of food. "Is Ro or B working tonight?" she yells to the guy. He stops his work and looks like he's thinking. "Ro is. Maybe Jake too." "Okay. Thanks, baby." She blows him a kiss and turns back to me. "Swan's is the best mechanic shop in these parts. I can give Ro a call and see if they can get ya hooked up tonight. I doubt they're too busy other than towin' cars at the bar so the drunks can't drive. Hold on a sec." She walks over to the phone—an actual wall phone—and makes a call. "You said a couple miles back? Which side?" she asks, covering the receiver. I tell her in as much detail as I can where my car is, and while she relays the information; my eyes take in my surroundings. The booth seats are covered in cheap, cracked vinyl and the faded yellow paint is the perfect complement to the drab interior. Formica with chips from years of use cover both the bar and table tops. All in all, it's a shitty little joint, probably what I can expect from the rest of the town. The lady hangs up the phone, drawing my attention back to her. "Ro said they'll stop by after they pick it up. While ya waitin', ya wanna eat somethin'?" Not sure whether letting these small town people get their hands on my baby is good news or not, I try to quell the nerves her statement brings. I seriously doubt Triple-A comes this far out anyway. The diner may look like shit but the smells wafting from the kitchen make my stomach grumble, so I nod and pick up the menu. Figuring, what the hell, I order the greasiest burger they offer. Not very fucking 'doctorly' of me, but under these circumstances, I'd say it's well deserved. Almost an hour later, I've finished eating and have called everyone that matters to let them know what happened. It's not looking like making the convention is very likely. Just as I hang up with my mom, a woman in overalls walks in. She's gorgeous. Blonde hair, blue eyes and even with the terrible clothes she's wearing, her body is smoking. Her face alone could rival some I've seen in movies. She makes her way over to the woman behind the counter, who, I have since learned, is Alice. Alice points in my direction and the blonde follows her gesture and starts heading my way. She might be beautiful, but I'm sick of blondes and definitely not looking for a hookup, so I hope she isn't planning to hit on me. "You own the red Alfa that needed to be towed?" she asks. Hmm, maybe she was impressed by my car. Sorry, lady, but I'm not interested. "Yes, that's my car," I say, trying to keep it brisk so she'll get the message. "Me and Jake picked it up." She throws her thumb over her shoulder toward a dark-haired man standing at the counter. "It's gonna need some serious work before you can drive her again and we don't stock parts for those so they'll need to be ordered." "I'm sorry. What? You picked up my car?" This beauty queen picked up my car? Oh, please don't let them have messed it up worse than it was. She rolls her eyes. "Yeah me and Jake. I'm Ro." She pulls out a card and passes it to me. "We open at nine in the mornin'. B will come in and have a look at your car. We'll put in a call once we know exactly what we need. If you wanna drop by that address"—she points to the card she handed me—"around eleven we should be able to tell ya somethin' then." Shocked that the blonde bombshell is the one who towed my car, I'm barely able to form a decent response. "Uh, okay, I guess. Thanks." I know that's probably all I can expect tonight, but now I'm going to need to figure out a place to stay in this shitty town. After Ro leaves, I get upand walk back to the counter, signaling for Alice. "Would you happen to know of a place I could stay tonight?" Alice is nice enough to drop me off at a local hotel. It's definitely nothing special and nowhere fucking near what I'm accustomed to, but it looks clean and has a bathroom and a bed. At this point, I don't really need more. I'm able to fall asleep almost as soon as my head hits the pillow. The next morning, I set out on foot. In the light of day, the town doesn't look quite as shitty as I'd imagined. Trees line the streets in formation, alternating with flowerbeds. There's old-town charm everywhere I look and anyone I pass is nice enough to say hello. I briefly think I could get used to this but then shake that thought from my head. I'm just burned out and needed a break. There's no way I could be happy in a town this small. When eleven draws near, I start making my way toward Swans. Thankfully, it's not hard to find. It seems most things are located within a few blocks of downtown. The first thing I notice when I walk into the garage is a spectacular ass sticking out of the interior of an old Mustang. Long smooth legs lead up to that ass which is encased in tight, very short, cutoff jean shorts. I can't make out much more since her head is inside the car, but I'm pretty sure this isn't Ro. Even though, from what I could see, Ro was beautiful, this ass is out of this world. Round and plump, accented by a small waist and those goddamn thighs. So lost am I in my perusal, that I almost miss the rest of her when she leans up from the car. My eyes travel upward, finding a tank top and skin. So much fucking skin. All shrouded in long, dark locks that hang almost to that delectable ass. I finally remember why I'm here and clear my throat. She turns and the world slows. She's fucking gorgeous. I've seen a lot of attractive women in the city but this girl, she's unreal. A wet dream come true, pulled straight from a poster on the wall of my sixteen-year-old self. I realize I'm staring when she cocks an eyebrow. "Um, I'm, uh, here to speak to someone about my car. Ro picked it up last night. She told me to, uh, come by and speak to someone named B today." I can't believe I'm having trouble talking around her. Usually, it's women who get flustered around me. Suddenly. I'm pissed. How dare this hick of a girl make me, Dr. Edward Cullen, act like an idiot. She's hot but nothing special. I bet she just cleans the cars or something. "Listen, is your boss here? I really need to know what's going on with my car though I'm not sure I want anyone here touching it." I'm being an asshole, but that car is my baby and I choose very carefully who I even let change the oil. It's not like I need to make friends here anyway. The woman stands there with her hand propped on her hip and a smirk on her lips. "You wanna talk to my boss? You don't think we can handle your car here?" she asks, amusement dancing in her dark eyes. "Look, I'm sure you all are great with trucks and regular cars, but my car isn't just any old car. It can't be treated like some Ford or Chevy or something," I explain a bit pissed with her attitude. She just continues smirking with her eyebrow cocked. "Look, is Ro here or B? I'd like to speak with someone right away please!" I'm getting so fucking exasperated with her attitude. It doesn't help that seeing her standing there with her hand propped on those
