Title: Personalities in Disorder Summary: For our dear Meli Stories. Emmett is sure that his smooth-talking friend, Edward, will be able to crack the thick ice of Bella the man-hater. Alice doesn't agree, and a wager is made. But both Emmett and Alice are surprised when neither Bella nor Edward act as they expected. Rating: M Pairing: E/B "It's all Jacob Black's fault! I could just strangle him!" Alice Brandon seethed, her dark eyes flashing. Jasper Hale raised an eyebrow. "Alrighty then. And this Jacob Black would be…?" "Bella's first boyfriend in high school. He cheated on her when she wouldn't put out for him." "That certainly makes him an asshole, but what does he have to do with—" "Mike Newton didn't help either," Alice continued, caught up in her rant. "I should've twisted his balls off when I had the chance!" "Mike Newton?" "The possessive, controlling slug she dated her freshman year in college. He hated when she spent time with any of her other friends and wanted to know what she was doing every minute of the day." "Okay, so there's Jacob and Mike—" "Ugh, how could I forget Paul? I think he was the nail in the coffin. That rat bastard. GQ on the surface, drug-dealing con man on the sly." Alice pounded her fists on the restaurant table with unadulterated anger. Jasper reached across the wood and gently grasped her hands. "Whoa, there, Karate Kid. Let's leave the place in one piece." "I know, I know, it's just…Bella's a sweet girl and doesn't deserve to have such a terrible history with guys." Alice sighed heavily. "I hate how introverted and closed off she's become." "Bella was your college roommate, right? The one who just moved back to Seattle?" Alice nodded. "Yeah. She went to live near her mom in Florida while getting her Master's but decided she'd rather settle down here. I feel like such a bad friend because I haven't seen her much since she's been back. You know how many hours Rose and I have been putting in lately. But now that wedding season is winding down, I'm trying to catch up with Bella." "I'm half-afraid to ask, but what brought on the sudden tirade?" A deep scowl formed on Alice's delicate features. "I was talking to her just before we left, trying to set up a casual get-together with some friends—you, Rose, maybe Rose's new guy if he's cool, Angela…" "And?" "And I might have given her a teeny tiny bit of grief about her lack of dating over the past three years." Jasper gave her a skeptical, probing look. " And …?" " And I told her I knew a bunch of nice guys and tried to set her up on some dates!" Alice huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. "I was just trying to be helpful! She didn't have to get so pissy about it and then hang up on me." It wasn't easy, but Jasper somehow managed to keep a straight face instead of chuckling like he wanted to. "Is there any possibility you might have been pressing her just a little too hard? I haven't known you for that long, Ali dear, but you can be very, uh, insistent at times." He gave her a tender smile to soften his words. "Yes, I suppose it's a possibility," Alice conceded with a guilty pout. "But I only have her happiness in mind. I know Bella. She's a romantic at heart who's always dreamed of having a cute little picket fence family with two-and-a-half Golden Retrievers or whatever. So she struck out three times. That doesn't mean she should stop playing ball forever!" "Who stopped playing ball?" Jasper and Alice turned in their seats at the sound of the amused voice behind them. "Hey, Rose!" Alice greeted, her eyes immediately going to the muscular man accompanying her friend. "And you're obviously Emmett. Good to finally meet you!" "Same here," he replied with an easy smile. "This is my brother, Jasper," Rosalie Hale said, taking a seat at the table. The two men shook hands and exchanged greetings. Rosalie didn't waste a moment getting the answer to her previous question. "So, what about this reluctant athlete?" Alice snorted. "I wouldn't exactly call Bella an athlete." "Oh lord," Rosalie groaned, rolling her eyes. "Are you going on about Bella's man-hate again? Give the girl a rest. So what if she wants to be a nun?" "But she doesn't, and that's my point!" "Really? Do you not remember how she acted the last time we visited her? When we finally did manage to drag her out to a club, she sat in the booth and sulked the whole time. The few guys that were stupid enough to ignore her scathing glare all crashed and burned in less than a minute. Face it, Ali, the massive ice chip on her shoulder isn't going anywhere anytime soon. No man alive's got a chance breaking her vow of bitter celibacy." Emmett McCarty let out a soft snort and smirked. "Oh, I bet I know someone who could melt her panties right off. The guy's, like, the Chick Whisperer or something." "Yeah?" Alice asked, her eyes alight with interest. But then her expression dimmed. "No, Rose is right. Bella would shoot down that playboy way before he ever got into panty-melting range." "Hey, Edward's not a playboy!" Emmett protested. "Yeah, he's smooth, alright, but there's not an ounce of sketchiness in him. He's respectful and loyal. I'd trust him with my kid sister—if I had one." "Well, since this guy's so great, I'm guessing he's taken, right?" Rose asked archly, examining her manicured fingernails. Emmett shrugged. "He's had one or two sorta-girlfriends over the years I've known him, but I don't think he's been very serious with any of them. Med school and residency ate a lot of his time, and honestly, I don't see him ever settling down. The man's married to his work." "What kind of doctor is he?" Jasper asked. "Edward just started his specialty residency," Emmett replied proudly. "Pediatric surgery." "Sounds like you have a man-crush on him, babe," Rosalie pointed out with a smirk. "Nah. It's true he's got the job, money, looks, and charm, but I'm a family guy through and through." He grinned at Rosalie. "I picture myself as one of those dads wearing a camo-colored baby carrier while pushing another one in a stroller. That's what I want someday." Both Jasper and Alice were shocked when an uncharacteristic blush spread across the blonde's cheeks. Alice recovered first. "Well," she said quickly, knowing Rosalie would appreciate a subject change, "the last thing I think Bella should do is jump into a relationship after so long, anyway. I just want her to loosen up a little around men—talk, maybe flirt a little, or even some good ol' fashioned grinding on the dance floor. But she's so far gone, I'll bet even your Wonder Boy couldn't put a crack in her ice." "I'll take that bet," Emmett declared with confidence. "I have yet to meet a straight woman or gay may who wasn't drawn to him in some way. You'll see what I mean." "I think I'll have to after that build-up," Alice said. "So what do I get when I win?" "What do you want?" Alice pursed her lips in thought. "Hmm. Actually, I'd rather lose the bet for Bella's sake, but since I know that's not gonna happen…I got it! Rosalie told me you have a Porsche." "Yeah," Emmett replied warily. "A 2011 Carrera GTS. Why?" "I want to drive it. For a whole weekend." Rosalie snickered at Emmett's pained expression as he considered her terms. "Alright, fine," he muttered. "But you have to promise this Bella-girl's not a closet lesbian or anything. Edward's good, but even his magic has a limit." "Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun with that car!" Alice squealed. "What do you want in the highly unlikely event that you win?" " When I win…huh, what else do I need other than bragging rights?" He turned to Rosalie. "Babe, you want me to make little Ali-cat your slave for a day or something?" "Nuh uh, keep me out of it," she said, shaking her blonde head. "I wish there was a way both of you could lose. This has disaster written all over it." "Yeah, like, what if Bella actually ends up liking this guy, but he's not interested?" Jasper asked. "That'd be pretty harsh." "I'm telling you, it's not gonna happen," Alice said. "I'm so sure that I'll clean Emmett's entire apartment to 'Alice standards' if she even gives him the time of day." "I'll take it!" Emmett exclaimed. "Rose told me how anal and germophobic you are. My place could use a good deep cleaning." "But Babe—" Rosalie began, scowling. She was interrupted when the waiter came to take their orders. Emmett could see that Rosalie was getting more worked up during the delay and jumped in to speak the moment the waiter turned away. "We're just having a little fun. I promise Bella won't get hurt," he soothed. "I'm telling you, Edward's one of those guys who could show up to repo your house, and you'd still end up thanking him for it somehow. The 'worst' that could happen is Bella getting a fun evening out of the deal and a new friend. With you 'n me being together, they're bound to meet at some point, anyway. Alice and I are simply observing their behavior and predicting the outcome. Think of it as silent data collection. We won't interfere with the natural course of things." Rosalie eyed Emmett and Alice in turn, only slightly mollified. "No interfering, huh? You'd better the hell not. I'll be watching you two." The two bettors then agreed that a night out for the six of them would be arranged when a suitable time could be found. Still irritated by the whole idea, Rosalie quickly turned the conversation to the success of the event planning business she and Alice owned. There was no more discussion concerning either Bella or Edward for the rest of the meal. Alice, however, couldn't get her mind off the wager. She had a strange feeling that it was important; that there was more on line than just winning a silly little bet. And even though her fingers itched to wrap themselves around the wheel of Emmett's Porsche, she'd be more than happy to lose if that meant Bella benefitted in some way. And so, the very next day, Alice sweet-talked Rosalie into manning the office by herself and showed up at Bella Swan's apartment door. It took the brunette several minutes to let her in, and when she did, she was not in the best of moods. "For God's sake, Alice, it's eight in the morning!" she groaned, lurching to her couch and falling flat onto it. "You know I don't wake up early unless I absolutely have to. And I'm on vacation. This is practically a crime." "Doesn't school start up again in a few weeks? You need to get your body used to a different schedule, or you'll be in a world of hurt that first week." "I'm working on it," Bella grumped, her face buried in a decorative pillow. "But I think I'm still on Florida time. I can't seem to fall asleep until late." "Well, maybe if you got up early every morning, you'd be tired enough at night." Bella struggled to lift her hand so she could flip Alice off. "Did you come here just to lecture me on my sleep habits, or is there another reason for your disgustingly cheerful presence at this ridiculous hour?" Alice plopped down on the couch on top of Bella's outstretched legs and swatted her rear end. "Well, other than to wonder why these ratty sweatpants are on your body instead of in the rag bin, I want to find out
