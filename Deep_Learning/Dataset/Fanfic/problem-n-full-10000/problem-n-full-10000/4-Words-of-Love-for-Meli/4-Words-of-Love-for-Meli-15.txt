SINGING OUT LOUD Summary: Do you ever sing out loud when you think you're alone – but then you get caught? A story about bike rides, silly songs and a handsome stranger. Pairing: E/B Rating: T. It's all very very innocent. I think. Written by: Lotus Wright Edward Cullen enjoyed living a healthy lifestyle. As a doctor – even as insignificant as his first-year residency status was – he felt he had to be a role model… The kind of person who inspires others. So he had inadvertently become that annoying friend who 'encourages' you to give up smoking; the one who trains for marathons in his spare time… the guy that says, "I'll just have water, please," when going out to a bar with friends. And of course, the person that makes you feel personally responsible for the earth's destruction when you get in your environmentally-unconscious, gas-slurping vehicle as he hops on his bicycle. Not because that's what he's saying to you, but because the image of such a healthy, idealistic young man riding his bike ignites the guilt in you because you know your car is bad. It's all just easier to ignore when not faced with a guy like Edward. He wasn't a bad person, though. In fact, he had many friends that liked him enough to overlook his slight 'holier-than-thou' syndrome. To them, he was just a loving, caring, occasionally funny dude who was always punctual and always traveled by bike. Edward didn't mean to be patronizing or judgmental, he was truly sincere in his idealism. He was one of those people that genuinely enjoyed the thirty-five-minute bicycle ride. As Edward started his commute home – somehow still lively after a grueling sixteen-hour shift – Bella Swan walked out the door of the coffee shop where she worked and approached her bike to do the same. That was, however, the only thing they had in common when it came to this particular physical activity. Bella hated her bike with a vengeance – but she hated rain even more. Having to rely on transportation without a roof in a city like Seattle meant frequently getting very, very wet. Today was a sunny spring day, so, at least, she couldn't moan about the weather. But the fact remained that Bella would avoid physical activity if at all possible (with the notable exception of sex, but that goes without saying). She only rode her bicycle because she was a poor student who needed to work and save money, and, therefore, had exchanged her money-guzzling piece of crap truck for a rickety, second-hand bike. Today was the first day of car-less transportation, which made the silent complaining about getting soaked from the rain a little premature. This morning's bike ride had been uneventful, boring and long, and had made her leg muscles announce themselves in a painful way – it was glaringly obvious that Bella's toned figure was thanks to good genes, and not due to any kind of effort on her part. As she began the first mile of her six-mile journey she ran through her grocery list in her mind and tried to force herself to remember that she would need to bring her iPod tomorrow; perhaps this commute would be a little more entertaining with music in her ears. For now, she'd just make do with singing songs inside her head. Except that there was no one around, the bike path long and silent, and she craved sound. She glanced around to double-check that she was alone, and hid the bottom half of her face in her scarf. The incognito-by-scarf look made her take on the part of an amateur bank robber, if bank robbers rode bicycles. However, the possible embarrassment of getting caught belting out songs in public was enough motivation to cover up. Softly, as she passed the few houses in the park-like area she was riding through, she gave into the temptation. " I was feeling done iiiiiiiiiiiin," she sang, slightly off-key but so quiet that her lack of vocal skill was hardly noticeable. "Couldn't win…." It helped, she immediately noticed – her feet pedaled a little faster, and she was already looking forward to the rest of the song, instead of just hating the exercise. " I'd only ever kissed before… I thought there's no use getting Into heavy petting It only leads to trouble and seat wetting…" Bella giggled to herself, remembering last year's Rocky Horror show at the University, where she'd been branded a 'virgin' – having never seen the show before. She thought about the difference between that show and last week's repeat performance, where she'd gone all out and dressed up as Magenta, marking a few freshmen as Rocky Horror virgins and singing along to all the songs. " Now all I wanna know… Is how to go I've tasted blood and I want more, more, more…" The song was too irresistible to sing at such a low volume, and slowly, as she biked on and still encountered no one, she grew more confident – and a little louder. " I'll put up no resistance, I want to stay the distance I've got an itch to scratch, I need assistaaaaaance!" Because life is rarely fair, just as she prepared to start the chorus, her solitude was interrupted as another cyclist came around the corner and crossed paths with Bella as he headed in the other direction. There was no way he hadn't heard the last sentence – Bella's volume had grown exponentially, imagining herself Janet with all her feelings of sexual frustration. Edward had been daydreaming, enjoying the color the spring flowers had brought to his route before he'd heard the singing. He'd only caught the last two sentences before he'd rounded the corner and saw the visible part of the singer's face turn completely red in obvious mortification. He wanted to say something to the beautiful brunette – 'don't stop, don't be embarrassed, it was lovely, and put a smile on my face, please, what's your name, would you like to grab a cup of coffee with me? ' – but as they were both in motion, and going in different directions at that, the window of opportunity to say anything at all was minuscule, and indeed, the moment was soon over. Before he could even open his mouth, their bikes were taking them farther away from each other by the second. He looked back – fruitlessly, of course, because she'd disappeared around the corner – and chuckled. He hadn't heard Rocky Horror songs since his pre-med days (he'd made a pretty good Dr. Frank-N-Furter one time after losing a bet), and it made him smile that this beautiful girl was singing Touch-A Touch-A Touch Me out loud, in public. The commute, while enjoyable, was mostly the same every day. If he left work at five PM, he'd wave to the old lady with the cane who walked her tiny lap dog in the street next to the hospital. He would pass the woman in the power suit that picked up her son from daycare every day at 5.25 PM, and the two teenagers that always seemed to hang out and smoke cigarettes in the park before dinnertime. There was no variety, nothing unexpected – until Rocky Horror girl. The anomaly was enough to interest him, let alone the fact that the girl, even when only partially visible and wrapped up in her brightly colored scarf, was undoubtedly beautiful. He hoped she'd brighten up his commutes more often… Maybe he'd even say hi one day. The ten minutes of Bella's ride that followed the unexpected encounter were filled with outward silence and inward cursing, embarrassment taking over other senses. Of all the songs to get caught singing, it had to be one about wanting sex, and of all the people to run into, it was a freaking god in human form. It had only lasted a second, of course, but she'd seen his eyebrows rise, his amused expression, and most of all, his outrageously handsome face. It was unfair, really, for one person to have such a long list of beautiful features. Ugh. She hoped she'd never see him again, for surely, she would just relive her mortification every time. For now, at least, she resolved to pass the time on her bike in silence. Of course, the next day, Bella overslept and had to race through her morning ritual to make it to work on time – and in the process forgot her iPod. And of course, the route hadn't changed and six miles was still quite a long boring distance, and soon she found herself in the same predicament as the day before. And eventually she couldn't resist: she'd woken up with a Wicked song stuck in her head, so really, the only way to go was to just sing it, and maybe she could get rid of it. " Whenever I see someone Less fortunate than I And let's face it - who isn't Less fortunate than I?" Bella giggled over the lyrics, and, thrilled that she hadn't had any more unexpected encounters with strangers, continued. " My tender heart tends to start to bleed And when someone needs a makeover I simply have to take over I know I know exactly what they need And even in your case Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face Don't worry - I'm determined to succeed Follow my lead And yes, indeed… You will be popularrrr!" The rest of the route to work was mostly a long stretch of straight roads, and she sang through several Wicked songs without incident – not even getting caught while attempting to belt out Defying Gravity . Having had a confidence boost from the uneventful – yet entertaining – ride to work, Bella didn't even try to fight the desire to sing out loud on the way back. She still stuck to musicals, although why, she couldn't say – perhaps it was just that these lyrics were more easily remembered. She'd just started the chorus on Wouldn't It Be Loverly - Lots of chocolate for me to eat, lots of coal makin' lots of heat – when she spotted the handsome stranger in the distance, biking towards her and she quickly shut up, feeling the blush of yesterday's embarrassment creep up again. At least she'd spotted him before he could hear her. Edward wanted to shout out when he again spotted yesterday's singing girl on his way home. He could tell the exact moment she'd seen him – even from the distance, it was easy to see that her lips suddenly stopped moving. Yeah, she'd definitely been singing. He chuckled to himself. As they passed each other, they locked eyes – but neither spoke and so the moment fled as quickly as yesterday's had. The next few weeks were much the same; their schedules were apparently so alike that they 'met' each other on their respective routes home a few times a week. They never saw each other in the mornings, as Edward's residency hours were a lot more grueling than Bella's part-time job at the coffee house. In the afternoons, Bella would sing her songs while being on the lookout for the handsome stranger. Edward, in the meantime, had changed from a relaxed cyclist that enjoyed the serenity of his surroundings to a cyclist who was constantly and completely focused on one thing only: the sight of the beautiful brunette in the distance, biking towards him. That, and working up the courage to make this day be the one where he'd use that short, fleeting moment where they pass each other, to say hi. But it always took him a beat too long to open his mouth, and the pretty girl would already be gone, and he would have done nothing but smile at her. She always smiled back, though, even the times that she spotted him too
