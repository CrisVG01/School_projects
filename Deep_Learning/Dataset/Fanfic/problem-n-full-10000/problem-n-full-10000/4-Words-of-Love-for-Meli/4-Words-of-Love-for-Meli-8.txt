A million thanks to my beta, the wonderful LatteCoug, and to my pre-reader, the amazing MizzezPattinson. Your friendship and support mean everything to me. Written for Words for Meli. Romance. Edward & Bella. Come, join me as we explore the rugged frontier of British Columbia with one lost pilot who is struggling to get rid of the demons that haunt him. I hope you enjoy. Frontiers - by CarLemon (Cars1) Edward The fog envelopes the tarmac as I sit, practically hyperventilating in the glass cockpit of the Airbus A320. I can't see a goddamn thing out the window. My heart is racing in my chest, and I feel like I might throw up. The controls blur in front of me, the blood pumping wildly behind my ears while I try to focus. Vaguely, I can hear passengers loading into the cabin behind me; the friendly voices of the flight attendants directing them to their seats, assisting with stowing their bags. It's been eleven months. I should be over this by now. I've been through enough therapy sessions, and spent a fucking fortune to try to chase the demons away. I've been perfect in every single flight simulation I've done since it happened. It's almost like it never really happened. Almost. But now, as I hear the faint cry of an infant in the cabin while I try to concentrate on the pre-flight routine, it all comes crashing back to me. No two flights are the same. Flying is complex, fluid, and constantly changing. It's a place where decision-making is critical. One mistake means the difference between life and death, and now, it's like I'm right back there, living it again. I can hear the engines thud mid-way through the flight. The thrust becomes non-existent, and the plane takes a gradual nosedive towards the Atlantic. Then I see very clearly the exact moment when I panicked. I freeze in front of the controls. The countless hours spent learning and flying, preparing for something like this fall away from me, and for a fraction of a second, I'm lost; a moment in time that changed my life completely. A moment that, if done differently, maybe would not have resulted in the loss of life. Pilots will have countless takeoffs and landings in their career. Most of the time, flights will simply blur together. Then, there are some that will stay with you forever. Flight 872, May 18, 2015, is mine. Even though I've received the Master's Medal for saving one hundred and thirty-nine lives, I don't feel like I deserve it. Even after his father told me it wasn't my fault, and the Prime Minister shook my hand and called me a hero. Even after I've attended countless dinners held, allegedly, in my honour. The only thing I can see, the only thing that matters, is the fact that one hundred and forty people boarded that plane, but only one hundred and thirty-nine came back alive. An eight-year-old little boy is dead, taken away before he got a chance to live, and it's my fault. I can hear the muffled confusion from passengers I'm responsible for behind the cockpit door. I hear the flight attendant, Jane, her strained voice through the intercom, though what she said on that day, I can't remember now. It's muted, hazy. I see my co-pilot, Jasper, his eyes focused in concentration while we work through the emergency procedure protocols to try to restart the engines. He's saying something to me; his lips are moving, but I can't hear him. The whitecaps on the aqua surface of the ocean loom closer, and something snaps in my brain. Regaining composure, somehow the plane levels. I hear myself announcing to the passengers and the crew to brace for impact – probably the worst words any pilot can ever say. Jasper and I work in tandem; quietly, methodically, fuelled solely by adrenaline. An eerie silence envelopes the cockpit. The sun beats down through a cloudless sky, and the calming blue ocean inches ever closer. I radio for help. The plane skims across the water for some indefinable period of time. And I do the only thing I can - focus on trying to land a commercial aircraft in the ocean. I remember us working through the evacuation checklist, ensuring the plane was depressurized once we stopped, before I opened the cockpit door and gave the order to evacuate. Children, fathers, mothers, strangers; their lives put blindly in my hands. I've heard their terrified cries most nights since it happened. I hear Jane giving the order to don life vests before helping to guide the passengers out the side doors and onto the slide rafts. I see the crew usher them out and into the ocean where they bob aimlessly, and wait thirty-two torturous minutes, adrift in the vastness of the Atlantic, until the Coast Guard rescue units start to arrive. I search relentlessly up and down the aisles, ensuring there is no one left inside, while the back of the cabin fills slowly with salty water. I remember how cold the ground felt as I knelt at the gravestone of the little boy who was trampled while the passengers scrambled over each other to evacuate. He died in the hospital fourteen hours later from internal injuries. I know distinctly, how it felt when his father put his hand on my shoulder and hugged me, comforted me , after I had taken his child away from him. "Earth to Cullen." Jasper's voice stirs me from the unwelcome memories. "You alright there, man?" He raises a brow. "Yeah, I'm good," I answer quietly with a nod, adjusting my headset again. "You sure about that? Now would be the time to let me know if you're not ready for this," he presses, sounding concerned. "I'm okay, Jasper." I hope it sounds convincing. "Just let me know if you're going to go all catatonic on me," he states, handing me the checklist. Right. The checklist. This is exactly what I need, every single move I make laid out for me. Something I can focus on. Lifting the clipboard from him, we systematically go over the pre-flight checks. I'm thankful that it's Jasper with me today. He's one of my best friends, and I don't have many of them. We met in flight school, flew our first commercial red-eye together, and survived that fateful day eleven months ago. So, it only seems fitting that he would be the one to sit beside me as I pilot my first flight since it happened. I've been cleared for months to return to the skies by countless psychiatrists, therapists, the airline, my mom and dad, my best friend Emmett, and my sister Alice. Somehow, they all seem to have faith in me. My father tells me everyone would have likely died with someone else at the controls. That the bank of experience and thousands of hours I logged in the air saved lives that day. My shrink tells me it's normal to question myself given what I went through. Normal. Nothing about this seems normal. The 'what-ifs' haunt me. The flashbacks are a consistent reminder. The lack of sleep plagues me. The nightmares vary in intensity. But this is all apparently normal. So why did I freeze for that fraction of a second? That's something no one has been able to answer, and something that will haunt me forever. I suppose at the end of the day it doesn't really matter why. The only thing that matters is someone is dead because of it. Emmett says I need to let go and move on; that I simply just need to fly again. He complains that since it happened, I'm no longer the confident, and let's face it, cocky, womanizing bastard I used to be. It's no secret that I have been with a lot of random women. Something about being a pilot seems to turn them on, and who am I to complain? I've actually not joined the mile-high club, despite the rumour mill. I take my job too seriously, and quite frankly, when I fuck, I'd prefer it to not be in a cramped, tiny space. But still, it's not as if I'm going to pretend I'm a saint. I have enjoyed my fair share of flight attendants. A steady relationship is not something I've had in a while. Being gone for as much as I am, coupled with the inevitable rumours that accompany this job, doesn't make for a package that most women want to sign up for. Jane and I had started to form something of a relationship before the accident. Well, as much as a pilot who is gone for days on end can be in a relationship with a head flight attendant who is never around, and fucks anything she can. Whatever Jane and I had came to a screeching halt after it became extremely apparent that I wasn't dealing with the accident. The nightmares, the panic attacks, and the post-traumatic stress I was diagnosed with, was too much for her to handle. I don't blame her. For weeks I was almost catatonic, just going through the motions; Jasper literally having to hold me up as we received our accolades of heroism on national television. Flying is in my blood, and I love it with a passion. My father is a pilot, and his father before him was as well. There's a sense of freedom, a power of being in control. To see the sights I've seen, the sunrises and the sunsets…each time it's a new experience. One I'll never take for granted. After the accident, it was like a cloak of darkness fell over me, and I just gave up until Emmett literally kicked my ass out of his bar one night after way too many shots of Crown. I crashed at his place that night, and thus began his project to get me back into the cockpit. So, he's back there now in the cabin with Alice, as we take the short flight from Toronto to Bermuda in what he's calling the " Cullen Come Back Tour ." He's got a week planned in Bermuda, that I'm sure will involve copious amounts of alcohol, and of course, knowing Emmett, plenty of women. Honestly, what I'd really like to do is sit on the beach by myself and finally forget about what happened. I'd like to do nothing but have drinks served to me by some anonymous waitress who doesn't speak to me, but I know that's not happening. I had shut out everyone, including my family after the accident, and Emmett has made it his personal mission to make sure that I don't ever spend too much time alone anymore. Hearing the flight attendant secure the cabin door, breaking me from my thoughts, I run through the checklist again. "Edward, we're good. You've checked it four times already," Jasper remind me with a smirk. "I think our passengers would like to hear from their captain now." I nod at him and glance out the side window. The fog has lifted. There will be no delaying the inevitable. Mustering up the soothing, in-control pilot voice, I greet the passengers over the in-flight announcement system. "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Edward Cullen, your captain, and along with the first officer and the crew, we'd like to welcome you aboard True North Air flight 489 with service from Toronto to Bermuda. The weather is sunny ahead with excellent visibility, and it looks like we'll have a smooth ride. Flying time is approximately two hours and forty minutes, with an estimated arrival time in Bermuda at 12:10 pm. Local weather is a twenty- seven degrees Celsius. That would be about eighty degrees, Emmett." Jasper smirks at me and shakes his head. "Once again, welcome aboard. We'll be airborne soon." After we receive clearance of crosschecks from the head attendant, Jasper grins as the pushback
