Playing to the Band (Inspired by Chris and Morgane Stapleton, but nothing in this fiction reflects on their own unique story.) On a night celebrating Emmett McCarty's singing career, Emmett and his wife remember the everyday magic behind his music. Genre-Romance R & Em I felt a bead of sweat run down the back of my dress. Great, I was going to have pit stains in all of the pictures! I was working at calming myself when Em leaned toward me. He ran his bear claw along my leg and capped my knee as he whispered, "Rose, you got my notes? I can't find them." After all these years, he still had no idea what his casual touch did to me. I reached over his broad chest, patted his inner coat pocket, and felt his humored rumble under my hand. He captured my hand and held it against his heart for a moment. I smiled as he released me and the audience applauded as the next two presenters of the night sauntered toward the mic. I studied my husband's profile as he watched the stage. He had the look of a barely tamed mountain man. His soft, fluffy beard rested on his buttoned vest, and his low-billed straw hat kept his long sandy hair in place as it cascaded past the shoulders of his knee-length suit coat. He was a beautiful, rugged man with the quiet soul of a poet. And he was mine. I swallowed the proud lump in my throat as the list of nominees for Best Single by a Male Vocalist sounded from the stage. Em dropped his head with a shy smile and grabbed my knee when the words ' Sojourner by Emmett McCarty' filled the room. I covered his hand with mine as Sojourner began playing and they announced the winner. He gave my knee a squeeze and was gone, walking the mile to the stage two rows away. My heart ached to follow him. Even though he was in front of crowds and on stages across the country night after night, he hated being in the spotlight. I watched him lean in to receive a hug from the pretty young thing holding the award, much as he would his sister. When he turned to the mic, the brim of his hat cast a shadow across his eyes. It was just as well. I thought back to the first time I saw him performing. I was a skinny, knobby-kneed sixteen-year-old. He was on his Uncle C's front porch playing with the older men of his family as people danced in the yard. I pushed my way past the tables of food to get a good look at the quiet boy back from working his brother's farm. I moved close to the impromptu stage to catch his eye, but he didn't play to the audience, he played to the band. He'd send a shy smile toward the crowd, but his focus stayed on the men playing around him and his hands moving skillfully over the strings of his guitar. I had to wait until well into the night for him to put down his guitar and notice me. It was my first kiss, out under his momma's Magnolia. I focused back on him, up on stage, surrounded by all the bright lights and glamor, and smiled. He still played to the band. He scratched his forehead, "It's a kindness, y'all think so highly of my music. I've enjoyed singing it for 'ya." He smiled shyly as the audience laughed. "I guess I ought to thank my label and manager. They've put a lot of stock in an old country boy from the back roads of Tennessee." I saw John Marcus from Blackwater Records nod toward the stage and Mickey James, Em's manager fist pump the air as they were recognized. "But mostly, I need to thank my wife." He lifted his chin bringing his eyes out from the shadow and looked straight at me. "She keeps me straight and makes me look good." He gave me a wink and a nod before waving his trophy and walking off stage with the sweet young thing trotting behind him. As the show went to commercial, people stood, stretching, and talking, but I stayed put as another bead of sweat rolled between my shoulder blades. Damn! "Our boy did good, huh?" I looked up to see Mickey leaning over the seat between us. 'Our boy'- Mickey didn't know Em beyond the image, but he learned from the last two fired managers not to impose on the creative side of things. Em would play anywhere and promote as needed but he picked his people, and he controlled the music. Once he found a manager to play along with his way, it was like the sails caught the wind to the joy of all on board. I smiled graciously, "He did just fine." ~o0o~ I need my Rosie. She always gets me ready for the next set. Why didn't I tell her to come back with me? Shit. I handed my statue to Mickey's assistant and found a wall to put my back against. The next presenters were standing just off stage waiting for their cue. People were milling about, but just off to the side my eye caught the little redhead that presented my award. She gave me a saccharine smile as she held my eye, trying for seductive. Lord! I shook my head and looked away. Maybe it was because I was setting up to perform Bourbon Bound with Jasper Hale but I closed my eyes, and I was back in that off stage dressing room with that little brunette between my legs. I rested my bourbon soaked head against the back of the couch, feeling, just feeling as s he ran her hands up my thighs. As fingers began working my belt buckle, a ringing from the side table had me crack my eye and turn my head in time to see Rose's number flash across my phone screen. My heart lurched, and I came rushing back to my surroundings. I pushed the girl away from me and stepped over her sprawled body. I canceled my next gig, firing my manager in the process, and flew home to Rosie's bed. She had stayed home to be a comfort to her heartbroken cousin. How could I begrudge her time with family? I told her the next day about the near disaster and checked into rehab with a black eye and busted lip. But she was there waiting for me when I got out. She loved me up good for two days straight when she got me home, making sure I knew which side my bread was buttered on. When I got back to the band, Ben and I wrote Bourbon Bound, and I told Rosie to purchase a travel bus with a big ass bed in the back because she was staying on the road with me. I needed my Rosie. She looked so beautiful tonight. The stylist wanted to pile her long hair in some fancy do, but I'd have none of it. They pulled her hair back from her face making it puff up a bit, and her golden locks were extra shiny down her back, curling at the ends. Yeah, she was awfully pretty tonight. I opened my eyes. The girl was gone, and Jasper Hale stood grinning before me. "Jasper," I said standing taller. "You ready for this!" his face broke out in an infectious grin as he smacked my back. I grinned back at him, nodding. Jasper was a pop star. He started in a boy band and was a great performer. He knew how to get a full stadium on their feet. I looked him over from his topknot to his sneakers and grinned again. I liked him. He was good people. ~o0o~ I smoothed my skirt, trying to sooth my nerves as the MC announced Em and Jasper Hale. The stage lights came up on the right, and there was the band behind the two singers. The familiar beginning notes of Bourbon Bound began, and I settled into my seat. I remembered the birth of that song. Em said it was his tithe back to God for giving him the clarity to make things right and keep me with him. I never thought of leaving—a frying pan upside his head—yes, but packing a bag—never. I smiled as he bowed his head over his guitar in the bridge of the song. He had been so contrite and earnest during that time, I was humbled to watch him work so hard to get it right and keep it right. And I thanked God every day for the gift of such a big-hearted man. The audience clapped as the song morphed from Bourbon Bound to Jasper's 2015 hit Liquid Love. The audience was on their feet as strobe lights kept the rhythm and I looked to my honky-tonk man to find him smiling broadly and enjoying himself. They made a good team. Jasper worked the room and built the energy of the audience, and Em's electric guitar jammed with Hale's charged lyrics taking it to a whole, new level. As the crowd roared, the two men bowed and pointed to each other to give away the credit for the success of the set. I knew by the way Em was smiling that he had a new friend in Jasper Hale. ~o0o~ I rushed to change my shirt, combed my hair and beard after the set, and tried not to let my frustration show as well-wishers stopped me as I raced back to my seat next to Rosie. When I finally slid in next to her, the awed pride welling in her eyes had my heart free-falling. It was the same sweet look she had when she got my attention twenty years ago. She was such a sweet young peach. Damn—I'd still walk through fire to have her swing her shine my way. I dropped my hand to her knee, and she gave it a squeeze. I was never one for public display, what Rosie and I had wasn't for others to share, but right then I wanted to kiss her—hard. I wanted to wrap my arms around her and feel her melt against me and know that no one got to see that side of my sweet firecracker but me, lucky sonofabitch that I was. "You didn't use your notes," she said leaning in and giving me a tease of cleavage. I focused on her hand resting on mine, "Yeah, I couldn't think," I said with a shrug. "Well, you did just fine," I caught her smile out of the corner of my eye as the presenters announced the nominees for Best Album of the Year . I patted my pocket, feeling the stiff paper, as they announced ' Sojourner by Emmett McCarty and Blackwater Records.' Sojourner began playing, and Mickey was pulling me out of my seat with a whoop and a back slap. He led me up to the stage with Marcus and his merry men followed close behind. A group of six men gathered around the mic, but Mickey pushed me to speak. I couldn't think and rambled about the project before stepping back for John Marcus to have his say. As I listened to Marcus drone on, I couldn't escape the feeling that I had forgotten something and tried to remember what I had said. Before I could sort it out, the music was swelling, and Marcus was leading the group off the stage. Mickey had his arm around my shoulder as we walked off when it hit me. I shrugged out of his arm and moved back to center stage. When the music faded, the room fell silent. I searched beyond the stage lights and found her in the aisle. "Uh—this album wouldn't be complete without Rose McCarty's harmonies. I—I'm
