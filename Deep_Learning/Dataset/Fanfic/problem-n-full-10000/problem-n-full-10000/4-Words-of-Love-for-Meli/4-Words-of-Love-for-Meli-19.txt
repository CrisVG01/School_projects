Summary: When Isabella Swan is kidnapped by her Uncle James and betrothed to the infamous gangster, Jacob Black, her father calls upon the only hope he has, The Pinkerton Agency, and their agents that never sleep. Pairing: Bella/Edward Rating: M Genre: Romance/Adventure We never sleep For Meli—This plot was to be my entry for the Age of Edward 2016 contest. Life happened and it did not get finished. But for you, my dear, I did it. I hope you enjoy it. 3 This is set somewhere between 1890-1910. Many thanks to May and Fran for organizing this (and any others I unintentionally omitted). Additional thanks to Fran for beta'ing this. Two men stared at page after page of gathered information in a cramped rented office near the heart of Buffalo, shuffling through their plan of attack with an eye for detail renown throughout the world. The open windows did nothing to cool the stuffy, oppressive summer heat as they developed a plan to bring down one of the most notorious criminals in Chicago and rescue an innocent young woman that had caught his eye. Bootlegging, prostitution, gambling. Jacob Black was known for it all but was always one-step ahead of the police when it came to prosecution. But now they had a federal charge that Black would not be able to avoid—kidnapping. "Are you certain this will work?" "Positive," replied a blond-headed young man, pushing back from the desk with an air of confidence. "And Miss Swan will be aboard the train?" "Multiple witnesses saw her with her uncle, James Hunter, at the station. He purchased two tickets and then the couple disappeared." The other man tsked and glared at his partner. He ran a hand through his hair in frustration as he shook his head. "So no one actually witnessed her board?" "If you would allow me the opportunity to finish, Edward, you would know that there were several accounts of a weeping woman in the first class Pullman car of the train as it sat awaiting departure. A man fitting Hunter's description was seen shooing away curious onlookers as well as other passengers." Edward Cullen rolled his eyes as he worried the silver badge in his pocket between his fingers. Jasper Whitlock chuckled as he saw his long-time friend's tell surface. When the agent was mulling over details, he always toyed with his badge. Edward instantly pulled his hand from his pocket and folded his arms across his chest. "Why was she crying?" Edward barked, trying to bring their attention back around to the issue at hand. Isabella Marie Swan, the purported fiancée of Jacob Ephraim Black, leader of the infamous Chicago Black Hearted Gang and niece of one of Black's men, James Hunter, had been spirited away from a rural, Western New York hamlet and all but forced onto a train bound for Illinois. "Rumor is she did not want to go," Jasper continued. "We do not deal in rumors, Jasper." Jasper sighed before pulling out another folder. He opened it and began reading a neatly typewritten paper. "Charles Swan. Home: Forks, New York. Widowed. Brother-in-law of James Hunter. Has not spoken to him in five years. Had no inkling Hunter would arrange a marriage for his daughter and then take her." "But Mr. Swan did not report it until now?" Edward asked, taking a few notations down in a small leather-bound notebook. It had been a week since she had been abducted. His partner shook his head and pulled out another piece of paper. Hunter had forced Isabella to write a note for Charles to find saying she had eloped. Words were underlined ever so faintly to read 'not my will.' The subtext was easy to miss. "She's of a marriageable age. Her father was … content … to have a good arrangement for Isabella." "Content?" "Well, considering the other choice words I could provide, it was the best Alice-approved option." Edward snorted. His sister hated foul language and had harped on and on with her husband to get him to overcome decades of poor habits. For her, Jasper changed something Edward could never understand. Relationships were not something he had time for and rarely experienced so Edward could not fathom why anyone would alter oneself for another. Long story short, though, and what the officers of the Pinkerton Agency did not know, was that Charles Swan could barely afford to keep the small, tar-papered shack he called home. The death of his wife devastated him and for the past five years, he spent most of his income from his job down at the canals on diversions and strong drink. In his heart of hearts, Charles thought he was providing his beloved daughter a chance at a better life by allowing her to run off and his brother-in-law to arrange a marriage for his daughter that did not involve a dowry of any sort. Then he had learned the truth—that James Hunter had kidnapped Isabella and was forcing her into an arranged marriage with the notorious Jacob Black. That flipped a switch within Charles. He had thrown out all of his alcohol and spent two days in the midst of his own personal hell as he dried out before contacting the Pinkerton Agency. He begged and pleaded for assistance, offering his only possession of value—his own servitude. "So she is not enamored with Mr. Black?" Jasper snorted. "They've never met," he continued. "Reports are that Mr. Hunter brought a portrait of Isabella to Chicago, and Mr. Black immediately ordered her to be brought to him. Miss Swan caused quite a public disturbance when she was dragged out of her schoolhouse. Two of her older male students tried to assist her, but her uncle pulled a gun on them." Edward immediately became concerned that they were dealing with a child bride situation. "How young is she?" "Twenty. She is- was a teacher. The board of education has nothing but good things to say about her abilities. Very dedicated and well-loved by her students. Marriage is the last thing on her mind by all accounts. She appears to be quite content with a spinster's life." Edward kept to himself his ever-present argument that just because one preferred to remain single beyond ones twentieth birthday, it did not classify one as a spinster or perpetual bachelor. At the ripe old age of twenty-five, he had endured many a lecture from his own mother who had birthed three children by this time. As the eldest, he bore the brunt of her desire for grandchildren. He shuddered at the thought of domesticity. "Do you think she will help us help her escape?" "Depends upon how convincing you can be, Antonia." ~WNS~ Isabella Swan stared out the window of the rapidly moving train as the New York countryside sped by as her rolling prison regained speed. The train had stopped at yet another small town before once again rumbling toward Chicago and away from Buffalo. She wondered if she would ever see her home again, if her father even looked up from his bottle when given the news of her abduction, and if Jessie would ever learn her state capitols without her assistance. "Out of my way, young man," a husky, muffled voice demanded from behind her. Isabella looked up to see a dark reflection in the window and imagined for a moment that a wraith had followed her aboard the train. A large part of her would not mind for some avenging angel to end this nightmare. Never in her entire life had she imagined she would be dragged from her beloved classroom and told she would never step foot there again, rather she would be married off to a blackguard with no say in the arrangement. Upon hearing shuffling behind her, Isabella spun around to get a better look and saw a tall woman clad in widow's weeds attempting to make her way down the aisle, her uncle blocking her way. "This is a private parlor," James announced, bowing up to his full height which still fell short of that of the woman in mourning. He looked up at the heavy netting hanging from a wide-brimmed hat that completely obscured his view of her face. "Is it, now? When I purchased this ticket, the agent said nothing about the president being aboard." The woman took a step forward only to find her way obscured. "Ma'am, with all due respect…" "Uncle James," Isabella interrupted, cringing when he spun around to face her. She unconsciously began to rub her wrist marred with the bruises from where he dragged her out of her classroom. She straightened in her seat and met his eyes. "Uncle James, please. What harm is it to share the car?" Isabella motioned toward the empty seats. "You have already sent everyone else away." "Enough, Isabella." "Allow me some female company with which to converse to make the trip that much shorter." "Enough, Isabella." "Heaven above knows this is not a venture of my choosing." "Isabella!" "What am I going to do? Leap from the train as it speeds towards Illinois?" "Quiet!" James' face turned bright red as spittle ran down his chin in his exasperation. He pulled a tattered handkerchief from his pocket and pawed at his face. She cowered back into her seat, not seeing the anger flashing in the mourning woman's eyes. James looked back and forth between the widow and his niece. Neither made him comfortable. He was a confirmed bachelor and the hysteria that often accompanied women, at least in his own mind, was reason enough to avoid prolonged exposure to them. He took a deep breath as he tried to ascertain what to do while both women silently stared at him. Now it would only be three more days before he and Isabella would disembark once and for all. He would be well paid by Jacob Black, and she would be married off. James silently cursed the day Jacob had come to the room he rented at a boarding house on the seedier side of Chicago and seen the drawing his sister Renee had made of Isabella. Once the boss had seen her, Isabella's fate had been sealed. Bring her to me. So it had been said; so it would be done. Now here they were, recently departed from the Buffalo train station journeying to Chicago. A muffled cry broke through Isabella's pinched lips as she tried to hold back the sound. Like an overtired child, she was rapidly losing control of her emotions. James glared at his niece and she once again cowered in her seat. The woman in mourning showed no reaction, though internally, a battle raged. No man should ever treat a woman such that she would recoil like that. "I'm getting a drink," James mumbled, forcing his way past the widow, slamming the car door behind him. With the train in motion once again, there was little Isabella could do to escape, and he needed a bracer to make it through the night. A new round of tears flowed down Isabella's face. She wondered how she had any left. Without looking, she felt someone sit across from her. Isabella attempted to straighten herself when a handkerchief appeared before her. She mutely gazed at the plain, unadorned piece of cotton. The kindness brought a fresh round of tears to her eyes, and she shook her head before accepting the handkerchief from a black lace gloved hand. "Thank you," she murmured. The widow's head tilted in a nod, indicating she had been heard. After a few minutes of silence, Isabella's tears stopped and she sighed as she gazed out the window at the slowly moving countryside. "Traveling for pleasure?" The question seemed so innocent and so softly made, Isabella was not sure she had heard correctly. When the query finally processed, she shook her head. "Your traveling companion seems … quite interesting." Isabella felt the first hint of a smile tug at
