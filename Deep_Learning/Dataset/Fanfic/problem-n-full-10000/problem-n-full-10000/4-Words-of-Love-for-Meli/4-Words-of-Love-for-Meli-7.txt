Four Family Flat Summary: An Italian family moves into a four family flat where they find themselves fighting with an angry tenant who complains they're noisy and disrespectful. A/N: A four family flat (AKA a multi-family residential) is a housing unit for several inhabitants, contained within one building or several within one complex. In this case, there are four. Dear Mr. Swan, While I understand you are not from this country and sometimes have trouble understanding these things, I find that it is important to inform you of something in the United States. This will bring you a long way, so I suggest you use it often. This term is known as respect—where, given that you understand the term correctly, you'll find yourself becoming mindful of your actions as a courtesy to other people. Respect is not a one-sided action, it is a give and take, and if you feel as though my family and I are undeserving of yours, please inform me immediately. Please, please keep in mind that I am not sending this as a means to quarrel with you. Like you, I am a working man, and I enjoy peace and quiet while I am trying to sleep. You have been living in my building for nearly three weeks, and I have not had a peaceful night's sleep since. Your children are loud. Your mother is rude. Your wife screams often. You blare your music and stomp your feet when you move around. It can be quite disruptive, especially when I have children of my own who are trying to sleep at night. Keep in mind you are not the only ones in the building. Yours truly, Carlisle Cullen (Apartment A) Blood rushes to my grandmother's cheeks. She is nearly bright purple, a disarming crazed look in her eyes. Her expression is terrifying but has nothing on my father's darkening glare. He has an unfathomable look in his eyes as if Mr. Cullen has insulted his entire family. I guess he has. In all fairness, Mr. Cullen is not wrong. We are loud. However, my dad wouldn't call it 'loud.' He would say we're passionate. We're Italian, it's in our blood! Unfortunately, this is not a matter of opinion, this is fact, and we could very well be kicked out of our home if we don't respect our neighbor's wishes. "What-a does-a he mean?" Nonna asks, waving the note in front of my father's face. She has been trying to get his attention for the past few minutes, but no one is moving from the living room. My mother and I are frozen in fear, anticipating Dad's reaction. I'm sitting on the couch gnawing on a straw as my mom bites her thumbnail and stares worriedly at him. Maybe Mr. Cullen misunderstood us in a few aspects. For one, we are from America. When we moved in, Nonna claimed that we were Italian, not that we were from Italy. Even my father was born in America. It was Nonna and Nonno who came here over forty years ago. My father can read, write, and understand English very well. As can Nonna, when she isn't playing dumb. "Mr. Cullen is saying we need to be considerate. Quieter," I explain, although it feels like I'm adding fuel to the invisible fire Mr. Cullen started when he left this note on our doorstep this evening. Nonna shakes her head. "Those-a Irish!" She shuffles across the room as fast as a woman her age can, which is just slow enough for my mother to jump up and stop her from reaching the doorknob. "Nonna, no!" my mom exclaims. Nonna is like a child who has been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. She snatches it back and spins around, pointing to my mother. "Go-a to bed-a, Renee!" Nonna shouts, moving over to the coat rack to find a jacket to put over her nightgown. Where the hell does she think she's going? "You're staying right here, you old kook," Mom hollers. I would be surprised if Mr. Cullen didn't already anticipate our arrival, with the way we're screaming. "You have no business going down there. They think you're insane as it is." Nonna gasps, throwing her hand over her chest, all innocent and shocked and overly dramatic. "Me-a?" "Yes, you!" Mom shouts. "You act nuttier than a damn Payday." I turn to check on my father. His eyes have grown distant and contemplative, his fingers tapping away rapidly against the armrest of his favorite recliner. He, predictably, is unaffected by the screaming match. "Dad?" I ask, reaching over to touch his shoulder. "Are you all right?" He leans forward to stand up. "Yep. I'll be right back, hon." Mom spins around, widening her arms at my father. "No, you won't! You're staying right here, Charlie. There is no way I'm letting you go down there and start a fi—" "I just want to talk," Dad says innocently, reaching across the couch to grab his gun holster. Oh no. Nonna has a wicked grin plastered on her face. My mother looks horrified when Dad secures it to his waist. "Oh, hell no! Take that gun out, right now!" My father simply removes his gun from the holster and saunters over to the door. My mom stands gaping momentarily until she blinks out of her stupor and stomps her foot down. "God dammit, Charlie!" "You-a going straight-a to hell, Renee-a!" Nonna chimes over her shoulder on the way to the kitchen. "No-a one goes-a to heaven with-a a mouth-a like-a that!" This has been mom's and Nonna's relationship for as long as I can remember. Back and forth, bickering and random hell banishments are regular occurrences at the Swan residence. I would call it dysfunctional, but I'm afraid I don't even have a volume control myself. It all started sometime after I was born when Nonna encouraged my mother to have another baby and she refused. Nonna could never forgive my mother for not providing her with more grandchildren. Once I overheard them fighting because Nonna was poking holes in condoms or something like that. "Leave the Cullens alone, both of you!" Mom's yelling has now reached eardrum-piercing octaves. I've never seen her so panicked before. It's kind of ridiculous. I mean, does she really think my dad will hurt Mr. Cullen? I doubt it. "Renee, I'm just going to talk," Dad says, all of a sudden seeming sincere and calm. Mom is unconvinced. "Put the gun away. You're scaring Bella," Mom lies. I'm not scared at all, and she damn well knows that. Dad sighs. "That girl is fearless." He looks back at me and winks. "She can come with me if you don't believe me. Everything will be fine." Mom purses her lips as if she's considering it. "Well …" "No," I say, at the same time Nonna dances in, smelling of marinara and oregano. "Yes!" she yells over me. She rushes to my side and pulls me from the couch. "Bella will-a be-a your a-a-a-a—" "Mediator," Mom finishes, looking annoyed with Nonna's English. I frown. "Why do I have to play peacemaker?" Dad grins. Mom shrugs. Nonna turns and struts out of the room as quickly as she entered. "You don't have to," Mom whispers, still seeming reluctant. Dammit! "Ugh, fine." I stand to wait for further instructions while my mother and father share a look. They have some strange silent conversation with their eyes before turning to me. "Okay. Go on. Talk ." She sends Dad a warning glare. My father's mustache twitches with his attempt not to smirk. He leans forward to kiss her cheek before turning to me. "All right, Bambina. You're going to mediate." My mom kisses my cheek on the way out the door and sends my father a final warning glare. I trail after him; downstairs and out the door until we're face to face with apartment A. Dad briefly looks at me before he raises his fist and gives it three hard knocks. We wait patiently for Mr. Cullen to answer. "He's probably rich," I say once the thought enters my head. Dad frowns. "I can't see why he's living in a four family flat if he's rich." "True. But have you checked out his ride?" Dad grins at my choice of words. "Oh, yes. I have." The door flies open and I step back when Mr. Cullen appears, dressed in pinstriped pajamas. Go figure . He's definitely rich. "You must be Mr. Swan," Mr. Cullen says, holding out his hand. "My wife met your family when you moved in. I'm Carlisle." Dad ignores the hand in front of him. "Mr. Cullen, I think you owe my daughter an apology." Oh, no. Oh no, no, no . Please, God, no. "I don't have children , I have one child, and this girl is in bed by nine p.m. each night, on the dot." That isn't true, at all. But I don't stop him. Charlie is on a roll. "We are Americans, born and bred. I am a cop, my wife is a school teacher, and my mother stays with us full time." He looks so vicious. Where did all this anger come from? "Whatever noises you claim to be hearing in this colorful letter you've written me, I'm afraid, are not coming from us, Mr. Cullen." I wipe away the sweat beading on my forehead. Ooh boy. Mr. Cullen is momentarily speechless. He takes one glance at me before cutting his eyes back to my father, straightening his shoulders. "Mr. … ?" "Swan," Dad replied through clenched teeth. Damn. He's pissed . "Swan," he finishes in a low sigh. "Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes. My name is Carlisle, and me, just like you, am a very busy man. But since you've moved into the apartment upstairs, my family has been in a constant state of distress." A bullet through the heart would have hurt Charlie Swan less. "You are loud and disruptive, and I'm sure anyone else in this building could vouch for that." Dad's eyes have gone wider than quarters. "Me?" Oh, shit! I scan around rapidly, searching for something to distract him. Maybe I could trip and fall? No, I always trip. He wouldn't even notice. "No, the only disruptive person here is you. And while we're on the topic of respect, I should make something else clear. I have been living here for weeks, this"—he points behind us, to the lot across the street—"is my parking spot. Not yours. Yours has been here"—he points to the empty spot in front of us—"since I've been here." Mr. Cullen crosses his arms. "I see we're at an impasse." Dad growls. "You mean to tell me you've been parking in my spot on purpose this whole time?" Mr. Cullen doesn't answer. "You should take a look around. You realize you're not the only one in this building, don't you?" As they're arguing, my eyes slide over Mr. Cullen's shoulders. I notice that a boy is standing only a few feet behind him. Unlike Mr. Cullen, he is tall, his silhouette towering over him. It's strange I haven't noticed him sooner. His reddish brown hair glows in the soft lamplight, casting a shadow on the side of his face. My eyes scan his face and find that he's free of impurities, unlike most boys my age. My eyes skirt down his form and back up, pausing on his face. I realize that his eyes are focused on mine and I turn to stone, feeling embarrassed at being caught gawking. I'm so weird. "I told you I have one child, my mother is not …" I can faintly hear my father cursing Mr. Cullen, but I do not dare remove my eyes from those gazing back at me. It seems like a sin to look away. His eyes move away from mine for only a fraction of a second
