Pien for Meli Dancing Queen. A Twilight fanfic by Pienuniek Summary: Poor little rich girl meets rich little poor boy. Sparks fly! But what do their so-called friends think about that? AH Romance Chapter 1 Her past. The large group was having the best time around Bella, who sat in the middle of them with a scowl on her face. There was so much she should be happy about but she just couldn't feel it with this group of sycophants around her. Today was her twenty-fifth birthday. The day she came into her inheritance. The day her guardian, Renee, had to step back and give over the reins of her life. The day she could finally decide her own fate. Yeah, right. Renee still ruled the roost with this party, because the guests around her were primarily Renee's friends and their entourage. Renee herself wasn't happy either. Her cozy position of spending two-thirds of Bella's monthly stipend had come to an end. That morning, Bella's solicitor had turned up and offered her an envelope. It held a new contract; an offer to stay on as housekeeper. The nasty part was the list of duties the housekeeper was to perform. Renee had hoped to live a life of luxury by seducing the man of the house. She was fired from her first position for just that. When Catherine Swan, Bella's mother had died just weeks after the girl was born, Renee had seen the opportunity that position held and jumped at the chance to nurse the grieving father of a newborn into a new life of keeping a wife in leisure. It didn't work out that way. The only woman Charlie Swan ever looked out for was his daughter, Isabella. The spitting image of his late wife and the light of his life. From the age of four, Charlie took his Bells with him to the stables of the Cygnet Ranch. That name always caused a buzz on the tracks, because at least six of the last ten winning horses came from that stable. Any horse with the prefix Cygnet to its name gained high praise and prizes. Yes, Charlie Swan was a well-known race horse breeder and he groomed his daughter to follow in his footsteps. As a little girl, she learned to ride and at the age of ten, she asked her father to be allowed to try and learn dressage. Fifteen years later, the stable's prefix had also become a household name in that branch of equestrian sports. When Bella was sixteen, she was in full control of the breeding at the stables. She had a knack for pairing mares and stallions to get the best results in both race and dressage horses. Charlie took care of the business side of things, although he still worked on the horses as hard as any groom in his employ. That became his downfall. He'd hired a new stable hand and while he was still awaiting the background checks, the lowlife had allowed his horse thief friends access to the stables. Charles was in late at night to check on a mare that was ready to foal when he disturbed the thieves in their illegal exploits. He was able to activate the alarm but was shot in the back for his troubles, leaving a distraught Bella alone to run the business all by herself. Charlie had left everything to his daughter, including a letter in which he warned her of Renee. Renee knew nothing about that the letter, however, Bella had always been wary of the woman's intentions. Not able to win over the man, she now recruited her friend's daughters to keep Bella in line. She was, after all, Bella's guardian and as such could make sure the girl kept her in the money. The last nine years the three of them had done everything to undermine Bella's self-esteem. Alice and Rose had declared themselves Bella's friends and started to form her into a socialite, against Bella's own wishes. Renee put in her two cents, pushing the girls on her. Their parents were clients of Cygnet Ranch, or at least in the same social circle. Bella's so-called friends hadn't actually taken notice of the things Bella appreciated, though. Bella was a breeches and T-shirt kind of girl; she didn't use make-up or perfume. On a typical day she put on her breeches and went to the stables, she took care of the training of most of the foals, making sure they were indeed suited for some kind of top equestrian spot. She succeeded in both race and dressage equally, although she worked mostly with the dressage foals. It was more than obvious that Bella enjoyed the companionship of horses a whole lot more than her mall-traipsing, self-imposed friends. Their overbearing ways made her shy and clumsy, and something they mercilessly exploited her shortcomings to put her down. The fact that she refused to wear heels over two inches made them declare her unladylike. When she was in college, Renee should have taken care of the business. But Renee, her friends, and her friend's daughters were all afraid of horses. Maybe afraid was the wrong word. They thought horses were fine from afar, but up close, they thought them to be stinking beasts that made you dirty. Being around them was not a fashion statement. A horse also would devour your clothing budget if you didn't watch out! Alice alone had three, room-sized walk-in closets that held her clothes. In those rooms, she had created seven sections, one for each weekday. Alice was a bit OCD about her clothes. Each day of the week had a predetermined color. People knew what day of the week it was by one look at her. She hated pastels; pink was a pastel to her. She had a section for each color of the rainbow. Shades of a color would be acceptable as long as everything she wore that day fell into that color scheme. She had a fourth room that was dedicated to shoes and accessories; getting dressed could take her anywhere from two to five hours depending on the occasion. Rose took Alice's advice in clothes but her focus was more on enhancing her plain exterior in a more permanent way. At twenty-five she had a mouth full of bright, white facings, permanently pouting lips that looked ready to burst, combined with a surprised expression that had been Botoxed on her face. She had implants in both her chest and rear to get curves on her rail thin, I'm-hungry body. Her hair was blonde from a salon that made it look good all over her body, with weekly touch ups. Their combined idea of dinner was a salad at one of the best restaurants in town for the price of a complete cow. Bella loved a good, home-cooked meal, something substantial after a hard day's work. The fact that she had natural curves and muscles made the girls and Renee call her fat. Her ribs couldn't be counted that was true, but her BMI was squarely in the healthy range, neither too high nor too low. Most of the time Bella could avoid them, even if they kept bombarding her with demanding texts and voicemails. Her work on the ranch, thank God, gave her enough excuses to stay out of their way. That didn't work for Renee's organized birthday party. That's why she now sat there, moping, between ridiculous amounts of presents, most of which wouldn't see the light of day after they were brought inside. The first four packages were from Renee and her friends. They gave her three, very flattering dresses that didn't contain enough fabric to cover her even if she wore them all at once. She put on her polite, fake, smile at those, but the fourth present had put the scowl back on her face. Renee found it prudent to give her a Weight Watchers subscription. She hastily put it aside to grab another gift bag. It produced the skimpiest workout clothes in a fluorescent yellow color of which Bella had never encountered. Where did they get this stuff? Alice giggled and pushed an envelope in Bella's hands commenting that those workout clothes would come in handy. With trepidation, Bella opened the envelope and read the gift certificate inside. Rose piped up that it should help her with her clumsy nature. Bella was beet red, and that color changed to purple when the rage at her would be friends 'gift.' They had given her an eight week, pole-dancing course. Alice made sure that Bella knew that it was on Wednesdays, 'their' day and the girls would pick her up an hour in advance so they could all go together. Bella almost burst with rage, which only grew when the girls giggled their hearts out at her expression. She knew they wouldn't let it go, she knew she would be subjected to eight hours of torment with those bitches in the gallery. Happy birthday to her. Wednesday arrived too soon in Bella's book. After she had taken care of her personal horses, she ate lunch and took fifteen minutes to dress somewhat Alice approved, dumped her new workout clothes in a duffle bag with a towel and a water bottle. She then sat in the living room with a good book to wait for the controlling 'friends' to pick her up. She'd spun her life like this, curtailing those girls to two moments in her week; Wednesday afternoons and Saturday evenings. With a sigh, she got up at two o'clock, picked up her bag and relocated to the front porch. They said they'd pick her up at two but knowing them, she still would have about half an hour to wait. To her surprise they arrived at ten past two, the possible humiliation they could dole out must have had some effect on their grooming skills, or their inner clockâ€¦ Nah. The moment she slid into the back of Alice's Wednesday car, a canary yellow Porsche Cayenne, Bella knew she should have driven herself to the studio. The name was familiar, but she had no idea where it was. The certificate held no address and that was why the already demeaning twosome had talked her into driving her there. She could have saved herself a lot of grief. Her jeans were too mundane; her blouse was not only out of style but a Friday blouse on a Wednesday to boot, and her duffle bag a crime against fashion. Rose added that she might have thought to tweeze her eyebrows; the unibrow was out of fashion. Bella just nodded her head and forgot what they said. Unbeknownst to the two harping bitches in the front seat, inside her duffle bag, a Dictaphone recorded everything said in the car. She had adopted that strategy soon after she had digested everything Charlie had told her in his letter. In the wall safe in her room, she had a large collection of tapes and memory cards, collected over the last nine years. After they had put her down enough, the two in the front seat ignored her, talking fashion and a possible nose job for Rose; she was convinced her nose wasn't pointy enough. The moment the car turned into the car park near the two-business building, Bella knew why she thought the name of the dance studio was familiar. The other business in the building held her vet clinic. Emmett and Jasper had been lucky enough to get help to set up their practice from the foster son of Carlisle and Esme Cullen, her neighbors. He had bought the entire building to help his college friends. Bella was quite amused that she didn't even know his name since Carlisle was tight-lipped about his foster son. The only things Bella had learned was that their foster son lived on their property in his own cabin, that he was very private and didn't like
