Lorraine Bubbleybear Juillerat B&E Earth Angel Lore The last time we heard from Edward, they were celebrating their daughter's third birthday, (although she thought she was five), and Bella surprised him by letting him know he was going to be a father again. We're catching up with them, a couple of years later. ~*~HS~*~ Over the last couple of years, Bella and I had settled into a comfortable routine between being part of the Volturi and Bella's work with her Granma Didy to help replenish the earth. We always made time; first for our little girl Reggie, and then when we added our son, Charlie, affectionately known as Chuck. They never went to bed without knowing how loved they were. We were fast approaching Reggie's fifth birthday and we were trying to decide what kind of education she was going to receive. We couldn't decide if she was going to be tutored by her Aunt Heidi, Didy's third child, or if she was going to Angel School up in Eden. And the reason we couldn't decide was due to her heritage. She should have been an Earth Angel, as she was the first-born and a girl; but she seemed to be more vampire than Angel and hadn't grown any wings. I didn't know that I wanted her that far from home every day even though she'd be in the safest place ever, but she was my little girl and I wanted her where I could see her. We were working on the theory that because she was part vampire she couldn't be an Earth Angel. It might have to skip a generation until Reggie had children, who would be less vampire than she is. The fact was that not even the Elder Council of Angels could tell us. They either didn't know or were sworn to secrecy by the Gods. That was until we reached the night before her birthday, exactly twenty-four hours to be precise. We were having a lounge around the house day because we knew the next day would be extremely busy with Reggie's birthday party and we wanted to be well rested. Chuck was waddling around in all his chubby baby glory, following his sister because he absolutely adored her, and she right back. They were playing a game of hide and seek, where Chuck was 'it' when Reggie screamed out in pain from her hiding spot causing not only her brother but her mother and myself to come running over to her. Bella and I landed at the same time next to our daughter who was laying on her front in tears, my back giving a spasm in two places when I did, which was weird. ' What's wrong, Edward?' Bella must have seen my face. "Doesn't matter, Reggie is what matters right now." She nodded. "Baby girl, what is it?" "My back, mommy!" she screamed. "It hurts!" I almost broke down in tears with her. I felt like a complete failure. Here I was her big bad vampire daddy and I couldn't prevent her from hurting. I would have taken it gladly, even gone through the pain of my change again if it would only take away her pain. "Weggie, Weggie, Weggie," Chuck chanted as he came around the lounge, having finally caught up with us. "Wot's wong wif Weggie?" "I don't know Chucky," I crooned as I picked him up. Bella cradled Reggie to her on the floor. "But we're going to go and call Grampa Charlie, okay?" I looked down at Bella as I said this to see that she was looking up at me with tears in eyes. ' Thank you, baby. I need him as much as she does.' "Me too, love. Me too." I took Chuck outside with me to call Charlie. I could still hear my baby girl's wails and they pierced me right through the heart. I was helpless, and that's not a feeling I dealt with well. Bringing up my wrist, I called him on the communication device hoping that he wasn't busy. " Edward? And Chucky! How's my favorite little guy?" "Gampa thewes somefing wong wif Weggie!" Chucky told him before I had a chance to explain. I could see the worry come over him when Chuck's words registered. "What's going on, Edward? What's wrong with Reggie?" "I don't know," I whined. "They were playing hide and seek when all of a sudden Reggie screamed out in pain. Bella and I got to her as fast as we could and found her sprawled out on the floor in tears!" " It's okay, calm down Edward. Was she on her front or her back? Did you experience anything?" I was brought up short when Charlie asked the second question, but I answered him anyway. "She was on her front, and complaining of back pain when Bella asked what was wrong," then more slowly. "When I knelt down beside her, I felt two spasms in different locations, both near my shoulder blades. Why Charlie, what's going on?" " I'll explain when we get there; just know it's nothing to panic about. Renee, Alison and I will be there as soon as possible." He hung up the device before I could say anything else. Chuck leaned over and grabbed my wrist, "Gampa? Where he go?" He asked looking up at me. I chuckled a little. "He had to hang up, so he could come for a visit with Granma and great Granma." "Yay!" That was when Reggie cried out in pain once more. "Weggie!" Chuck wriggled, wanting to be put down. I placed him on the ground and followed him through the house as he made his way back to his sister's side. He plopped his little butt on the floor and reached out for one of her hands. "Careful my little man," Bella warned. "She may squeeze too hard." "Is okay. Imma big boy, I help." ' Did dad give you any idea on what's happening?' I shook my head as I sat on the floor, pulling Chuck into my lap. "No, but he, your mother and Alison are all on their way down. He'd said he'd explain it then." "Okay." She breathed. "Let's get her up to her room and off of this uncomfortable floor." I nodded placing Chucky on his feet before standing and carefully pulling my baby girl into my arms. I kept her lying face down because her back was still hurting; I could still feel a twinge in mine every other time she screamed. I hoped Charlie would get here soon. ~*~HS~*~ Not long after I put my crying daughter to bed, and she fell into a fitful sleep, did Charlie and the others knock at our villa door. Although I got a surprise when I found Didy there as well. Before I could invite them in, Reggie screamed out again from upstairs and they forced their way in the door. I followed behind as they practically ran to her room. "Daddy!" Bella scrambled up and into her father's arms, once again making me feel useless. I had nothing to give my girls; it seemed they didn't even want my comfort. "Oh no, Edward! No that's not it at all." Bella stated with tears in her eyes. "I'm sorry if I made you feel that way." She cried as she ran into my arms. I held my wife, as my daughter cried out again, with poor Chucky taking the brunt of her squeezing. But he was a trooper; he held her hand and patted her head, anything to try to make her feel better. "What's going on Charlie?" I asked while watching Didy, Renee and Alison scramble around the room and house collecting things like blankets, flannels, sheets and warm water. "What's happening to my girl?" He sighed. "It seems we're seeing a new version of Earth Angel Lore." Both Bella and I gave him looks stating that he had better explain. "When Angels are born, they don't have any wings. During the first twenty-four hour period, they grow them in, and it's very, very painful," He started. "We all thought that because she was part vampire that the gene would skip a generation, and start with her children. It looks as if we were wrong." He then grabbed a pair of Reggie's scissors and cut two long slits into the top she was wearing, and then beckoning us closer. "It seems that when an Earth Angel is part vampire that her wings don't come in straight away. They wait until the time is right. That, or they've been growing all this time, and now it's time for them to break free. Because her skin is harder, it's probably going to hurt more." He gestured to Reggie's back. Bella and I looked down to see the beginning of two slits trying to form, right where Bella's would be. Bella gasped, before covering her mouth and bursting into tears. I pulled her closer to me, trying to offer the comfort she so desperately needed. "You said you felt twinges, Edward?" Charlie asked. I nodded. "Yeah, exactly where those would beâ€¦why?" "As a father, you feel useless, right?" I nodded. "You wish you could take the pain your wife suffered in childbirth?" Again, I nodded. "Well, you couldn't do that, but this, this is what you are doing for Reggie. Every father feels when their child's wings come in; you take some of the pain that she feels onto yourself. You'll probably find that as it wears on, that pain will increase, because hers will. Trust me, this I remember." Bella leaned up and gave me a kiss before she made her way back to our daughter, taking Chucky's place. I felt better knowing that I was taking some of the pain for Reggie, I just wish it would be more. "Edward?" Alison called, as she came in with the bowl of water. "I know that Chucky wants to help, but I think it might be best if Heidi and Demetri take him back to the castle. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better." "Okay. Come on Chuckster; let's go see if Aunt Heidi can come get you." I reached down to pick him up, but he fought me on it. "No dadee, no. I wanna say wif Weggie!" I pried his hands off his sister. "I know you do bud. But I think it might be best for Reggie if you're having some fun, okay?" "Weally? Buts I wanna help." "And you're a big, brave boy for that. We just think it might be helpful if Reggie doesn't have to worry about scaring you." He nodded. "Otay, Dadee. Buts let me give Weggie a tiss." I leaned him down from his perch in my arms so that he could give Reggie a kiss, then his mother one, before I took him out of Reggie's room. I walked over to his room to pack him a small bag and called Demetri who said he would be right over to get him. I opened the door when he knocked, only to find both him and Heidi ashen-faced because Reggie had screamed out as I had done so. "Thank you, for this." "You're welcome, Edward. Is she going to be okay?" Heidi asked. "She will be once her wings break through. Hoping for a boy now?" I asked as I leaned down to give her belly a rub. It seemed that Eden was in need of more angels because Heidi had announced her pregnancy just this past month. "We don't care," Demetri beamed, ever the proud papa. "Even if we have to go through this, the baby will be worth every minute." "That they are," I agreed handing over Chucky. "Be good, little man. And we'll see you here for Reggie's party tomorrow." "Otay, Dadee. Lubs you." I kissed his cheek. "Love you, too." As soon as the door was closed,
