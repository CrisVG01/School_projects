This story is a thank you card, a get well card, and a love letter all rolled into one. I hope you like it. -Maggie (NewTwilightFan) Puppy Love I don't have many talents, but I can type like nobody's business. Seven hours of transcription work each day keeps the debtors away. When I'm bored, I surf the internet. When I'm feeling lazy, I sit out on my back patio with a book. When I'm stressed, I veg out in front of the TV with a bowl of Mr. Chun's chicken chow mein. I'm not afraid of people, per se. It's just that there's only enough room in my mind for me. I know that makes me a pathetic freak in my mother's eyes, but I'm okay with it. Happy, even. Obviously, I'm not a very active person. I'm one of those people who scurries from the front door to the car, then from the car back into the house with a bag of take-out after a long day of typing. So what made me squeeze into my yoga pants and runners to go out walking at 9:07 that night? I don't really know. A touch of claustrophobia? Perhaps I needed to taste cool, fresh air after the oppressive heat of the late summer day. Or maybe it was the fact that my favorite jeans were starting to feel a tad snug. Call it fate. Or luck. Call it divine Providence. You can call it whatever you like. That night I found love. It was late on a Friday evening when I pulled my hair into a ponytail, took my keys, then scuffled down the steps of my two-bedroom duplex. Night was creeping in, swallowing the sky inch by inch, steadily turning it from dim blue to gray to black. I carved a big square through my neighborhood on foot. First I walked four blocks east, then turned left, walked four blocks, turned west, traipsed on for another four blocks, turned south, and kept on walking until the tail of my car was visible in the driveway a couple hundred yards in front of me. I quickened my pace, feeling a little short of breath, but surprisingly good considering my general lack of fitness. Then I heard a sound then froze me to the core. It was an agonized whimper; a teeny, tiny, mewling cry of hopeless distress and pain. I looked around frantically, driven by some powerful inner need to find the creature and ease its suffering. The sound seemed to be coming from a car parked up against the curb. As I neared the vehicle, I realized the cries were coming from beneath it, not inside. Crouching down on the sidewalk, I peeked beneath the old sedan, straining to see into the dark shadows cast by the street lamps. I finally located the creature, a dark lump pressed up against one of the rear tires. I went around to the other side of the car and called out in a voice I didn't recognize; a soft, comforting, nurturing voice. The animal, I could now tell it was a small dog, scrabbled with its forelegs and pushed its nose toward my outstretched hand. I felt tears burning hot tracks down my cheeks. Something was very, very wrong. By the size of its paws, big floppy ears and the soft lines of its tawny face, I could tell it was only a few months old. As it pressed its nose against my palm, I could see how its hind legs dragged limp and helpless behind it. "Shhhh, shhhh, honey. It's okay. I've got you," I whispered, my tears making my voice rough. The puppy's whimpers grew softer, and I was overcome by a terror so deep and strong it seemed to grip my soul and crush it. "No, no, no. Don't quit on me, buddy. Come on. We're going to get you some help." Doing something, well, that quieted the terror somewhat. He cried out as I lifted him into my arms, and I cringed. The poor thing only weighed about twenty pounds, but I was so terrified of hurting him worse that he felt more like one hundred. I was taking decisive action, but inside my head, I was a sobbing, blubbering mess. The poor creature was writhing in my arms, his forepaws kneading my chest. His left hind leg was twitching and circling fitfully, but the other lay limp and unresponsive against my arm. There was no blood that I could see, but perhaps he had been hit by a car or bike. Maybe he was kicked or abused, then abandoned when the owner realized what he or she had done. That thought made my blood boil. Somehow I unlocked my car without dropping my burden, and curled him up as gently as I could on the front passenger seat. For once I didn't scurry up my front steps, glancing back over my shoulder to watch for prying eyes. I didn't care if there was anyone else around observing me. I just didn't. Instead, I raced up the stairs, pushed the front door out of my way like it was the door of an Old West saloon, and snagged my phone and wallet off the chair in my living room. When I slid behind the wheel and looked down at my charge, my heart sank. He wasn't moving. His head was tipped to one side, not in the way a dog lies while sleeping, or even stretching. It looked more like his head had rolled that way involuntarily, but he didn't have the strength or will to move it back. "Oh, buddy. Don't give up now. We're gonna find a doctor. We can fix it. I promise." A cynical voice inside said I was lying, that he was a goner, and I should just start digging a hole. I told that bitch to go fuck herself. She didn't know a damn thing. You see, I already loved him. I didn't know it yet, but the sounds of his cries had awoken instincts within me that I never knew I possessed. He changed me into a fighter, a champion, a friend and… for lack of a better term, a mommy. There was no way I was going to sit by and watch him get swallowed up by the pain. If he was truly doomed, he was going to go peacefully with me holding him close until it was time to let go. And I wasn't ready to let go yet. I knew exactly where the animal hospital was. I passed it every time I drove to Sonic for my cherry lime-ade fix. Despite the hour, the lights were on, and the entrance was bright and welcoming. I eased into a parking stall, gritting my teeth when I hit the brakes a little too hard, and a whimper of protest rose up from the seat beside me. I talked to him the whole time, murmuring words of comfort and reassurance, as much to quiet the mayhem in my head as to calm him. It worked. He let me pick him up again, his big chocolate eyes locking on mine with so much trust and acceptance that I couldn't look away. I rushed inside, striding through the automatic sliding doors like I was the star of some prime time hospital drama. A bored-looking young woman glanced up from her phone when the door chimed, and she took in the whole picture with a glance. "Dr. Cheney, we have an emergency," she called into the intercom. "Rhodesian Ridgeback, three months, hit and run." "Wait… how did you…?" I stumbled through my confusion. "I've been doing this a while. You aren't his owner, are you?" she asked with sympathy, motioning me through a door into an exam room. I shook my head. "But how did you know?" "Your shirt. It's covered in dog hair. Most pet owners shy away from fabrics like that, the ones that attract hair like magnets. And it's black, which only makes it worse. You're dressed for exercise, but he's not wearing a collar or a leash, and it's kind of late for dog-walking anyway. I connected the dots. I'm Angela, by the way. I'm Dr. Cheney's assistant." "Hi, I'm Bella. And you're right. I was out on a walk when I heard him crying. I've driven by your office so many times, but I never expected to be coming here myself. I'm not really a pet person." The truth was, I wasn't really a people person, either. She was working efficiently as we spoke, helping me transfer the puppy onto a padded exam table with a raised lip. She covered him with a heated towel, her hand resting gently alongside his face. I watched as his tongue peaked out to caress her palm, like a greeting between creatures that don't need words to speak. He recognized something in her. Some sixth sense told him she was good and safe. She was going to help make things better. For one split-second, I was irrationally jealous. I told the crazy woman in my head to shut up, and took up a station near his shoulder, waiting for the doc to arrive. "Hmmm. No collar, no chip. Of course, he's so young, I doubt the owner intended to have him out much yet. How did you get away?" she asked the puppy in a coaxing tone. "Did you go out on a puppy adventure all by yourself?" Angela kept talking as she moved about, taking the puppy's vitals and clucking sympathetically when he whimpered. "I had a Ridgeback when I was a kid. He was strong and crazy and the best friend a girl could ever have. And funny. He would bring my shoes to the table while I was eating breakfast and try to nudge them onto my feet. He always wanted to play fetch in the backyard before I left for school. It didn't matter what the weather looked like, he just wanted to run." I smiled involuntarily at the idyllic picture that formed in my head. I had never considered myself a pet person, probably because my parents weren't pet people. I had a fish once. He was left over from a science unit about water habitats in fourth grade. I dutifully fed him (or maybe it was a her) smelly flakes twice each day, but the poor thing didn't last a week. My dad flushed the pasty-eyed carcass down the toilet, and I took it as a sign that I wasn't cut out to be a caregiver. Perhaps I had been selling myself short. I didn't know the first thing about saving a dog's life, but I wanted to try. I glanced up as a stern-looking man entered the room, his washed-out blue eyes peering over a pair of gold-rimmed spectacle. "Poor little man," he sighed, folding back the towel to take over the examination. "Hip fracture, possible femoral fracture. Did you get his weight?" he asked, turning to Angela. "Yes. Eleven point eight kilograms." I felt ignored, pushed aside, as the man focused all of his attention on the puppy. Squashing my annoyance, I stepped back against a wall to let them work. Angela prepared a syringe for the vet to sedate the puppy, and I felt the tears drip down my cheeks as his tiny body relaxed and grew completely limp. He looked dead except for the slow rise and fall of his rib cage. "He's voiding. That's good, at least," the doctor commented, glancing at my shirt and pants. I hadn't noticed before, but they were damp
