This is 4 years after the war Hermione Granger called professor Mcgonagall and ask can we meet up somewhere then professor Mcgonagall told me oh course my dear when I saw professor Mcgonagall she look so tried and stress and then she hugged and ask so Hermione whats been going on with you I haven`t seen you in four years after you took snape to the hospital wing you know you saved his life that day then professor Mcgonagall well hermione I need a extra teacher in Hogwarts would you like to be one of the teacher in Hogwarts so I looked at her and took a deep breath and ask will professor snape be there and then professor Mcgonagall said well of course dear he is the potions teacher still so I looked at professor Mcgonagall and told her yes I would love to be one of the teachers at Hogwarts so that night I pack all of my clothes and got into my car and fly to Hogwarts and then when I got there professor Mcgonagall and professor snape were waiting for me to come so as I got out of the car professor snape looked at me and said hello miss Granger and I stared back into his black cold eyes he was always a good teacher but you think after I saved his life he would be more kind to people but no he is still distant to everybody then professor Mcgonagall welcome hermione as one of my new teachers and she smile at me while saying it then I look at snape again and I realize why I left Hogwarts it was because I am in love with him but I couldn't let him find out about it so as I went inside if the castle Mcgonagall told snape to show me my room so he look at me and said follow me miss Granger then he said she put you next to my bedroom so we share everything bathroom,and the common room but please just don't make a mess and as I looked into his cold black eyes my heart started to beat very fast then he said see you in the great hall in ten minutes after he left me to my thought I couldn't stop thinking about him and the way he makes me feel so I told myself to calm down and as I walked to the great hall there was Mcgonagall after we were cool and then she told me come to my office after you finished your food Hermione so I told her I will be there as I was eating my food I notice that professor snape was looking at me the whole time there what does this mean I said to myself could he have feeling for me I hope so and as I got up he stood up too and I went to Mcgonagall office and knock on the door and Mcgonagall open the door and she told Hermione sit down I need to talk to you and then she said how does it feel begin back here so I told her it feels weird Mcgonagall and then she ask I know you don't want to be next to snape bedroom but I think it's the best thing for him so I look at her with a smile she notice I smiled when she said snape name and ask so you and snape whats going on and I told her nothing I just never-mind then she ask what is it Hermione you can tell me anything it will stay between us girls OK Hermione so now tell me so what is it then I told well after the war when I took snape to the hospital wing and I waited and waited for him to wake up I fell in love him that night that's why I went away for four years and me seeing him just makes me be more in love with him than I was back then she laugh at me and said that's nothing dear you could date him and I won't even care you are a grown up now you do whatever you want to do but I do have to admit sometimes he can be really hard on people even new teachers but hey maybe he won't with you since you saved his life and after all he is a great man I watch him grow up to be a good man its just that bad things happens to him its not his fault but maybe you can warm his cold heart for once that is what I would love to see and as I walked out of her office I told her goodnight Mcgonagall and I left and went to the common room and as I was reading a book I fell asleep and then someone came and put a blanket on me and then I woke up it was snape he was reading my book right next to me and then he look at me and said I like this book and I told him that book is my favorite I read that book almost 20 times you can borrow it if you want snape as I left he said miss Granger your a teacher now call me Severus and then I looked at him and said I will if you call me hermione and then he looked at me and said deal and then he said goodnight Hermione I will see you tomorrow morning and as I walked to my room I grab my stuff to go take a shower and as I turn the water on I hear snape saying to himself why does she want me to call her by her first name then I go into the shower and then I start to clean my body and I feel like someone is watching me so I turn the water off and ask who is there no one answer me so I turn the water back on and I felt someone behind me and when I turn there was Mcgonagall dear you should look the door and I said I know it's just that I was in a hurry to take a shower so I could go to sleep and after she left I got out of the shower and got my towel and when I look up there he was staring at me and told me that he needed to confess something to me and then I fell and he caught me in his arms and he look right into my eyes and said be very careful Hermione and when he caught me my towel fell to the floor he didn't even look at me in any way so he grab my towel and said here get dress and then he left and as I think to myself saying god I wish he kissed him but he didn1t but I knew right there that we had a moment but he didn't even say anything about it I felt so embarrassed that I was in his arms naked but nothing happen but I thought to myself maybe he was just being a gentleman so as I finish getting dress and he just walks right in to my room excuse me you need to knock before entering my room and he looks at me and said OK shall I do it again then I said no its OK and I smile and he said well since we are sharing almost everything we need to set up times for each other better what do you say and then I got a letter he said is it from your boyfriend Ron I laugh at his face me and Ron and I aren't together anymore he was very abusive then he looks at me with a sad face and said all the bruises you have are from him and I looked at him and started to cry and I said yes they are Severus walks up to me and said no man should lay his hand on women like that he doesn't deserve you as I look into his eyes and he looks into mine I get closer to him but then he pulls me away and said well goodnight Hermione and he shut the door behind him then I kept having nightmare and screaming about Bellatrix writing on my arm mud-blood then Mcgonagall came running Hermione,Hermione,Hermione wake up so I woke up really fast come with me and she took me to her office and sat with me and ask what happened so I told her it was just a nightmare don't worry then she said tell me the truth you were yelling Bellatrix name so I told it was in the war when Bellatrix found the Gryffindor sword in my purse so she wrote mud-blood on my arm and she look at me and pin me to the wall and ask me are you OK Hermione? So all I told her was that I would be fined so then she let me go back to bed the next morning when I got up Mcgonagall was in my room and said I want you to sit next to me at breakfast today OK Hermione and as I look at her and said so then she ask when are you gonna tell Severus you are in love with him she looks at me and I said I dont know what you are talking about Mcgonagall and as he turned away to face me I wanted to tell him but I couldn't I think he is scared to show his feelings next time I will show him my feeling that I have for him so as I sat at the table Severus said Mcgonagall put me as your mentor for this year and I looked at him and said I do not care Severus then Mcgonagall look at me and said come with me we went into the hall and ask what is happening between snape and you and I told her me and Severus have been having moment all night but he doesn't do anything about it then she tell me to take the first move and I looked at her and said are you crazy Mcgonagall he needs to make the first move yes you are right but he is probably scared of being denied so take it slow with him he will come to his senses when he is ready but for now get close to him. And I said I have to go to my class and Severus was there waiting for me at the back of the classroom and said start to teacher as I taught the class Severus was writing things down in his notebook and he stood quiet for the whole class and then after the class he went up to me and said your teacher is weak then I told him we teach the same Severus and then he grab my hand and took me to this place where I never been before and I ask what is this place and he said I grew up here this is my hiding place when I used to go to school here still the same as I left it so I sat down on the grass and looked at the water then he said you are right Hermione. So I looked at him and said right about what Severus then he look at me and sat down next to me and said about your teaching you are always in my head you drive me crazy Hermione I just want to denied that everything you said about my teaching is wrong but it`s not you are just like me in a way and I know Mcgonagall wants us to get closer and I do not want that so stop looking at me during your teachings
