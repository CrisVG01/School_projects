Thank you to Isa for the inspiration, Jen for the beta work, and you for reading. Midnight - because you asked - and you so rarely do - this is for you. ** The Beginning - Age six** "Momma?" "Yes, Edward?" "I don't wanna do this." She knelt down in front of me, smiling. Wrapping her arms around me, she let me bury my face into her hair. I smelled it. I liked how my momma's hair smelled. It was pretty—like her. "Tell me why." "'Cause." "'Cause is not a reason, Edward Anthony Cullen. It's just a word." "People will be looking. I don't like people looking." "But I need you to do this." "Why?" "Because Bella is scared to walk down the aisle alone. I need you to be big and strong, hold her hand and walk with her. It would make Auntie Renee so happy." I frowned. I liked Auntie Renee. She made good cookies. She wasn't my real auntie—she was my momma's best friend, but my momma said it was the same thing. And Bella was pretty nice—for a girl. She wore jeans and shirts and let me play in her treehouse, which was really cool. She never cried if she got dirty, and she had great comics. I didn't like the idea of her being scared. So maybe if it made Auntie Renee happy and Bella not be scared, I could do this. But the looking…it always made me nervous. People pointed and whispered, and I didn't like that. "Edward." I looked up at my momma. "Today is a special day for Renee. She found her hero, and today Bella gets a new daddy. Everyone is going to be looking at them, not you. I promise." My eyes widened. Uncle Charlie was a hero? Did he have a cape? I must have said that out loud, because Momma laughed and tweaked my nose. "You can ask him after the ceremony." She held out her hand. "You look so handsome, Edward. Just like your daddy. Can you do this for me?" "Will Daddy be proud?" "He'll burst his buttons!" I grinned. I wanted to see that. "Okay, Momma. I'll walk with Bella." "That's my boy." ~o0o~ I gaped at the little girl across the room. That wasn't Bella. This girl was wearing a frilly dress, and her shoes had bows of them. Her hair was long and hung down her back. I didn't know Bella had that much hair. Her face was clean too. I bet her momma made her scrub behind her ears like mine did. It tickled. Bella grinned at me, and my eyes widened. "Bella—your teeth are gone!" She giggled. "I fell off a sthwing and knocked 'em out. But look!" She leaned close, poking at her gums. "New ones are comin'!" I squinted my eyes and saw the little white lines on her gums. I nodded—they looked just like mine when my teeth came out. But mine came out 'cause cause they were loose, not because I fell off a swing. Bella was always falling. That's probably why they wanted me to walk with her today. I could hold her up. Auntie Renee came over, clapping her hands. "Look how cute you are, Edward!" I puffed out my chest, shaking my head at her. "Boys aren't cute," I clarified. "My momma said I was handsome." She and Momma looked at each other and laughed. "Handsome, then. Isn't Bella pretty? You two will be the perfect couple!" I had no idea what a couple was, but I looked at Bella again. She looked different than how she usually looked, but Auntie Renee was right. "Yes," I said seriously. "Bella is very pretty today." They started talking, and I moved closer to Bella. "I'll hold your hand, Bella. You not have to be scared." Her eyes were wide. "I have to toss petals. I need both hands." I looked down in disgust at the pillow Aunt Renee had given me—it had frilly stuff on it. "I have to hold this 'cause cause it has the rings on it." I frowned, not sure what to do. Then I smiled. "We can both hold the basket, and I'll put my hand on top of your, like this," I explained, showing her. She smiled widely, showing the big gap in her mouth. It made me smile back. "Thanks, Edward." There was something I wanted to ask, and I knew if I asked Bella, she wouldn't laugh. Looking around, I leaned down so I could whisper. "Bella, does Uncle Charlie have a cape?" ~o0o~ Despite what Momma said, people looked. But I remembered my promise, and instead of looking back, I looked at the basket between us and concentrated on my hand covering Bella's, and making sure she didn't trip. The petals she kept throwing were very slippery. It was boring standing to the side with Daddy, but his hand felt nice on my shoulder. Twice I saw Bella wobble a little. The second time she did it, I rolled my eyes. She'd told me her shoes hurt her feet. She should just take them off—why wear them if they hurt? When all the grown-ups moved and went to a table to do something important, she squirmed again. I shook my head and called over to her. "Take your shoes off, Bella." I heard people chuckle, but I ignored them. Bella shook her head, and I sighed. She was so stubborn. I went over and stood beside her. "Take them off so your feet don't hurt." "I can't—I don't think you're allowed to at church." I groaned. She was so silly. "Of course you can," I assured her. "Look, I will, too." I kicked mine off and wiggled my toes. "That feels better." Bella hesitated, then stepped out of her shoes, wiggling her toes too. "Yeah," she agreed with a nod. People were laughing, and I glared at them. Grabbing her hand, I pulled her down the aisle, ignoring my momma's voice telling me to stay. Nobody was laughing at me and Bella. ~o0o~ Later, after supper, I sat in the corner, feeling grumpy. Momma had scolded me for dragging Bella down the aisle and taking off my shoes, even when I told her it was for Bella. Daddy laughed and told Momma to calm down 'cause cause I was only looking after my girl. I had no idea what that meant, but Momma stopped shaking her finger at me and Auntie Renee said it was the "sweetest thing ever." I shook my head. It was just shoes. I was tired and I wanted to go home, but all the grown-ups were dancing. Supper was weird, with lots of foods I'd never seen before, and I didn't like it. Momma said there'd be cake, but I hadn't seen it yet. That just made me grumpier. Bella slid into the seat next to me and smiled. "Hi." "Hi." "What's wrong?" I turned away. "Nothing." Her voice sounded funny when she spoke again. "Are you mad at me, Edward?" "No." Stupid girl. "I have a surprise." "I don't want no surprises." "You'll like it." I hesitated. I was grumpy, but I really did like surprises. "What is it?" "You have to come to another table to get it." "I like it here." Nobody could see me here. Nobody was laughing. "It's a good surprise." "Fine," I huffed. I knew Bella wouldn't stop until she showed me. She tugged my hand, and I followed her across the room, ignoring the people looking at us. We got to another table, where Uncle Charlie was waiting, a big grin on his face. "There's my favorite guy!" I rolled my eyes at him, but he shook his head and lowered down so he was my height. "You are my favorite guy, Edward. And what you did today? You deserve a reward." "What did I do?" "You helped Bella. You saw she was hurting, and you put her first and took care of her." "I got in trouble and people laughed." He ruffled my hair. "Nah, kiddo. You're not in trouble. Sometimes people laugh because you make them happy—not because they're making fun of you." "Really?" "Yup. You added a great memory to this special day—one I'll never forget. And that deserves a treat." He stood up and indicated the table. My eyes widened at what was there. A cheese pizza, two chocolate milks, and two pieces of cake. I looked up at him. "For us?" "Yep. I ordered it in special for you and my Bells, here. Dinner was too grown-up for you. Now you two sit and eat, and when you're done, I'm gonna dance with my new daughter." He walked away, and I grinned at Bella. "I know you've never seen it, but I think he does have a cape." ~o0o~ "Edward?" "Hmmm?" I asked, concentrating on making sure I got every last crumb of cake off my plate. It was good cake with lots of thick, chocolate frosting. I glanced over at Bella's plate, wondering if she was going to finish hers. There was lots left on there. "Will you dance with me?" I gaped at her. "I don't dance , Bella. I'm six." "Everybody dances." I shook my head. "Not me." "Please?" I groaned. "Please, Edward?" "People will look," I mumbled. "I'll hold your hand and it won't matter—like at the church." Then, as added incentive, she slid her plate my way. "You can have the rest of my cake." "And your chocolate milk?" "Yes." "Okay." She jumped up and held out her hand. Nervously, I looked around. Everyone seemed to be busy dancing or talking, so maybe they wouldn't notice us. I took her hand, and we walked over to the dance floor. My momma and daddy were there and he grinned down at me. "Taking a turn, Edward?" "Bella wants to," I grumbled. "I don't really wanna. And I don't know how." He hunched down. "Trust me, son. You're going to do a lot of things in life you don't want to do because of a pair of pretty, dark eyes." He looked at my momma. "Isn't that right, Esme, my love?" She swatted his head. "Carlisle! Stop teasing him." Laughing, he stood up and shook his head. "Just watch me, Edward." He put his hands on Momma's waist, and she wrapped her arms around his neck. He waited until Bella and I mimicked them, and then he started moving his feet. I did the same thing, wondering how long I had to do this for—after all, there was cake waiting for me. Bella put her head on my shoulder, and I was about to pull away until I saw Momma had done the same thing to Daddy. He had his cheek pressed to her head, and with a sigh I did the same thing, just like he told me. I shuffled my feet, trying not to step on Bella's toes. I didn't think she'd like that. Dancing seemed kinda boring to me. Although I had to admit, I did like how nice it felt to have Bella's head on my shoulder. Her hair smelt like bubble gum. I liked it. Not that I would ever tell anyone that. Ever. **The Middle - Age 16** My hands tightened into fists so hard, they ached. "Say it again, asshole." I straightened my stance. "I dare you." Mike Newton glared up at from the ground, blood dripping down from his nose, pooling in the dirt in front of him. "You broke my fucking nose," he whined. "Touch her or disrespect her again, and a broken nose will be the least of your worries," I sneered at him. I glanced over at Bella, who was sitting on the grass, Angela beside her with her arm wrapped around her shoulder. Tears ran down her face as she cradled her arm close to her chest. My own chest ached the way it always did
