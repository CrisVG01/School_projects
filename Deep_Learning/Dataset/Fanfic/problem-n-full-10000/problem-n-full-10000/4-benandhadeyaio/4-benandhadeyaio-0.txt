For years I have lived in New York with my friends The Mathews but ever since my sister moved back in with my father and I have had a weekend when I was missing in the state park and had the "animal accident" but it is time to go back home to forks washington it would probably be better besides even though I'm a Year younger from my sister Bella but we share a birthday so I was excited her and her boyfriend were gonna pick me up from the airport my name is Brandon Swan and I am a Wolf I saw my sister we changed bear hugs her boyfriend gave me a weird vibe but I sucked it down we got to the old house and my dad said that he would be their in a few hours my sister got the bed room up stairs my dad gave me his room while he made his man cave/ basement into his room I had to tell my sister to do something since today is a full moon. "Hey bells" I said "Yeah Brand" She said "I need to tell you something follow me" I said she followed me into the forest and we were deep so no one would see us "I need your help and only yours but I ask you to keep this under wraps" I said "You can trust me" she said "Ok a month ago I went on a trip with my friends to a state park I got separated from the group I spent the night alone cold but then a wolf appeared it was big bigger than the average wolf and it bites me just one bit ever since then I have had this ability" I said I shifted into a golden wolf with dark brown eyes she was shocked but I showed her that I meant know harm she petted me I then shifted back into a teenage boy "bELLA i Need your help tonight because before the wolf left I heard him him say for the next 4 full moons to stay in my wolf process will begin If I'm out I will not have any control I can kill someone you or dad " I said "I won't let that happen" she said Hugging me "Bella promise me you won't tell anyone no one that I am what I am remember when I was an in the closet gay this is just like that" I said "Promise" She said "Ok Bella lock me inside my room ok make sure Dad does not hear me the moon i going to rise in a few hours" I said she went drastic she got chains from he truck to tie me up and she used my dresser to barcode me in she told my dad I was not feeling good so she took him out to the movies everything went dark around 8pm the I woke up in a room that looked like a hurricane blew through it was not to messy just one claw marks my sister came in and unchained me I was sore but felt bigger I had muscles and Abs I went down stairs my dad greeted me with a bear hug and me and my sister went to go hang for the day I went in my wolf form I was not big as the wolf Who bit me yet but I still gave he like a ten minute Ride then I got pushed in the face by a cold hand it was Edward taking Bella I growled and Barked and snarled he hissed "Edward stop" Bella said trying to get to me "Bella this wolf is bad lets get out of here" Edward said "thats Brandon" he looked shocked at what Bella said he then put her down she ran to see my face and I snarled at Edward know he was bad news she told me he was a vampire I was disgusted but for her sake I just sucked it up again then our birthday "Morning Family its the Swan brother and sister birthday Bash" I said Bella gave me a glare I handed her a present it was of a picture of us when we were kids we went to forks high and we met Edward's sister Alice "Hi Im Alice your Bella's brother even though your a wolf I love birthdays" she said handing me a present "yes i DO BUT bELLA DOESNT BECAUSE OF" I pointed silently at Edward for the rest of the day I had so much to do my old best friend Jacob Black and His friends wanted to hang with me for my birthday so I went to his house he had a cake he got frosting on me so me and his friend got into a food fight at the end we were eating the leftovers "This is pretty good" I said I heard my phone ring it was Alice I walked outside to talk what she said made my blood boil "HE WHAT I KNEW IT I KEW IT IM GOING HOME BELLA BETTER BE THEIR AND FOR EDWARD'S SAKE HE BETTER NOT BE THEIR" I said SCREAMING Jacob came out worried "is everything ok" he said "Uh yes no I just have to go" I said getting my messenger bag I ran not the forest when I was out of sight I took of my cloths off put them in my bag and turned into my wolf form and I carried my bag in my mouth and ran to the house when I got they Edward left I shifted back into a human and put on my cloths and ran into the house I saw bella's hand and I quickly said "Ok thats it sorry Bella but your boyfriend is going to torn apart" I said "It was an accident I cut myself and Jasper could not control himself it was my fault" she said I hugged her she asked me to stay with her in my wolf form I did made sure the door was locked the next day I went back to jacobs after school then I got a call from my dad at 8pm "Yellow" I said "Brandon is your sister with you she is missing" Charlie said I panicked I said I would find I then ran into the forest did the same procedure as yesterday I ran back to the house I picked up her sent when I found her she seemed broken sobbing thank god she was not bleeding dead or bitten I played down next to her she was my sister I had to confront her screw if everyone was looking for her she needs me but I got up when I heard a snap it was a big black wolf a hell lot bigger than me but I did not care when he got into fighting position so did I but when I heard my sister cry I went to comfort her I even touched her forehead with my wet noise the other wolf looked in confusion Bella whispered she wanted to go home I then saw how the wolf shifted into a man Bella fainted so she did not see I shifted into my human form "Who are you?" he asked "Brandon Swan I was bitten you" I said "Sam Uley born shifter and current Alpha of the Quileutae Wolf Pack" he said "Ok" I said "Can you carry her back to my house my dad can't see me" I said he did and for the next month Bella has been depressed and sad until Jacob and me started to hang with her again we built three bikes my full moon its got worse my wolf form has gotten bigger but not as big as Sam and my body temp has not improved either then one day Bella came home saying Jake did not want to be friend so I went with her I suspected Sam had something to do with this I stayed in Bella's truck as she went in the I saw Sam and other shirtless guys come from the forest I saw Bella approach Sam and push him she was barking at the guys about Jacob and she slapped one oh shit it about to get real I thought the guy turned into a wolf I ran out of the truck Jacob ran out of his house and me and him Shifted into wolf to protect Bella the Big Grey Wolf sprinted to attack bELLA HE WAS WAY BIGGER BUT i DID NOT CARE i Attacked him he bitt me on my arm and the everything around us started to fade away and I gazed into his eyes and I then heard his thoughts Your my Imprint he thought Whats that I thought your my mate Oh ok Everything around us returned and I winched in pain to the Bite I collapsed to the ground My imprint ran to me to see if I'm alright I gazed into his eyes I then saw how everyone was looking at us Sam sent two guys to take Jacob and Bella to someone named Emily he then stepped near me and My mate automatically snarled "Don't worry Paul I won't hurt him" Sam said stepping Back I auto magically shifted into cut night Jeans and My mate did as well he saw the bite he did and went to me to treat it I could not stop gazing at him "Paul Brandon this is not how imprinting usually works" Sam said "But Paul Im glad you found your mate" Sam continued "Brandon you have to learn about imprint since you and paul imprinted on each other Imprint is when you two are bound together you two belong together Brandon I want to join our Pack" Sam said "Yes absolutely yes" I said we ran back with them and Bella and Jacob were obviously talking "don't stare it pisses sam off"Paul said I noticed he was holding my hand I blushed then he noticed and continued I then saw a girl with a scar on her face I then just smiled she hugged me "Good to have another Imprint" Emily said "You hungry" she said "Yeah" I said we had dinner Bella stayed with Jacob while Paul took me Back home in his truck I WAS SO COLD "You cold" said Paul "Yeah" I said he pulled me into his arms and I warmed up "What do you think of this imprint thing" said Paul I then Kissed him on the cheek he blushed he stopped the car and he cupped my face and he kissed me I loved it I knew I found my match "Uh Sam wants to know if you wanted me to teach you about your bite effect" Paul said "Yeah" I replied and Kissed he then took me home i was happy I then went to bed and I got up early when I sensed Paul coming near me I went to go greet him with a kiss he wrapped his arms around my waist and we ran we shifted into out wolf forms and ran to a cliff by La Push we shifted back "So uh when a person is bitten they gain the powers but their not like the normal wolf" Paul said with his arm around me "They take 4 months to become fully grown and your not gonna be as big as me but still pretty big" he said "Yeah Im almost three months in and uh well my sister locks me in my room and chains me up but this moon I uh escaped the chains good thing I did not escape the room" I said "Yeah also uh you can carry a litter" Paul said Blushing "You mean I can get pregnant" I said "Yeah" He said "I want to have a baby with you
